        Clinical observations and potential concerns:
        {observations}
        
        IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Consider multiple possible diagnoses that could explain the symptoms
        - Do not default to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly warranted by the symptoms
        - Be open to various diagnostic possibilities including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, trauma-related disorders, etc.
        - Make your diagnosis based solely on the symptoms presented, not on assumptions
        - If symptoms are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis, indicate this is a provisional impression
        
        Please analyze these responses and observations and provide a professional assessment that MUST follow this EXACT structure:

        1. First paragraph: Write a compassionate summary of what you've heard from the patient, showing empathy for their situation.
        
        2. After that, include a section with the heading "**Diagnosis:**" (exactly as shown, with the asterisks)
           - On the same line, immediately after the heading, provide the specific diagnosis or clinical impression
           - Do not add extra newlines between the heading and the diagnosis
        
        3. Next, include a section with the heading "**Reasoning:**" (exactly as shown, with the asterisks)
           - Immediately after this heading, explain your rationale for the diagnosis/impression
           - Do not add extra newlines between the heading and your explanation
        
        4. Finally, include a section with the heading "**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**" (exactly as shown, with the asterisks)
           - List specific numbered recommendations (1., 2., 3., etc.)
           - Make each recommendation clear and actionable
        
        When writing your assessment, use these special tags:
        - Wrap medical terms and conditions in <med>medical term</med> tags
        - Wrap symptoms in <sym>symptom</sym> tags
        - Wrap patient quotes or paraphrases in <quote>patient quote</quote> tags
        
        EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
        1. Do NOT include any introductory statements answering the prompt" 
        2. Do NOT begin with phrases like "Okay, here's a clinical assessment..."
        3. Start DIRECTLY with the compassionate summary paragraph without any preamble
        4. Never include meta-commentary about what you're about to write
        5. Include all four components in the exact order specified
        6. Format section headings consistently with double asterisks
        7. Maintain proper spacing between sections (one blank line)
        8. Do not add extra newlines within sections
        9. Always wrap medical terms, symptoms, and quotes in the specified tags

        Keep your tone professional but warm, showing empathy while maintaining clinical objectivity.
