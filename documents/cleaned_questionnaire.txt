Additional Information for Clinicians

Instructions:
The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a self- or informant-rated tool assessing mental health domains across psychiatric diagnoses. It is designed to help clinicians identify additional areas of inquiry that might significantly impact treatment and prognosis, as well as track changes in symptom presentation over time.

Measure Details:
- Content: 23 questions assessing 13 psychiatric domains: depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use.
- Administration: If the patient is unable to complete the form (e.g., due to dementia), a knowledgeable informant may provide responses.
- Reliability: The measure has shown clinical usefulness and good test-retest reliability in DSM-5 Field Trials conducted in clinical samples in the United States and Canada.

Scoring and Interpretation:
- Scale: Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = none/not at all; 1 = slight/rare, less than a day or two; 2 = mild/several days; 3 = moderate/more than half the days; 4 = severe/nearly every day).
- Highest Domain Score: Clinicians should review each item within a domain and record the highest score in the “Highest Domain Score” column.
- Further Inquiry:
  - A rating of mild (2) or greater in any domain (except substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis) should prompt additional inquiry.
  - For substance use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, a rating of slight (1) or greater should prompt further evaluation.
- Level 2 Measures: DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures are available for more detailed assessment in some domains (see Table 1 below).

Frequency of Use:
- The measure may be administered at regular intervals to track changes in symptoms.
- For individuals with impaired capacity, it is recommended that the same knowledgeable informant complete follow-up assessments.
- Consistently high scores in a domain may indicate problematic symptoms that warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should be used to guide these decisions.
