      "content": "\n<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided the patient's answers to the DSM-5 questionnaire and wants a structured clinical assessment. First, I need to ensure I follow the exact format they specified. \n\nStarting with the compassionate summary. The patient's main issues are social avoidance and anxiety, so I should acknowledge their struggle without jargon. Use the tags for symptoms and quotes as needed.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The symptoms clearly point to Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The patient\u2019s avoidance of social interactions, physical symptoms like stomach aches and panic, and the impact on work all fit DSM-5 criteria. I need to confirm there's no better fit, like Panic Disorder, but the context here is social-specific. Somatic symptoms are present but tied to anxiety, so Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't primary.\n\nFor the reasoning, I'll need to list the criteria met: fear of negative evaluation, avoidance, physical symptoms, duration over two weeks (as per the questionnaire timeframe), and functional impairment. Differentiate from other disorders like GAD by noting the social specificity.\n\nTreatment steps: CBT is first-line for SAD. Medication like SSRIs could be suggested. Group therapy might help, but start with individual. Education on anxiety physiology and gradual exposure are standard. No need for crisis plans since no self-harm mentioned.\n\nCheck all formatting: section headings with asterisks, tags properly used, and structure strictly followed. Make sure not to mention any other disorders unless relevant. Avoid markdown, just plain text with specified tags. Double-check the diagnosis aligns with responses. Ensure empathy in the summary and clarity in recommendations.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> in social settings, persistent <sym>avoidance of social obligations</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like trembling and stomach aches were consistently linked to anticipated judgment during interactions. Your description of feeling like <quote>\"my body betrays me\"</quote> in stressful situations underscores how deeply this distress impacts your daily life.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with somatic comorbidities  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s **persistent fear of social evaluation** (evident in Q1, Q8), **avoidance behaviors** (e.g., declining promotions, avoiding coworkers), and **physical manifestations** (tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress per Q9) align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> DSM-5 criteria. <sym>Panic-like symptoms</sym> (Q7) are contextualized by feared social triggers, not standalone panic attacks. <sym>Lack of energy</sym> (Q4) and <sym>low mood</sym> (Q2) reflect secondary distress from social impairment rather than primary depression or mania. Somatic symptoms are anxiety-mediated (<med>somatization</med>), not indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as they are directly tied to anxiety.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** focusing on social anxiety, including exposure therapy to gradually reduce avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) if symptoms interfere with daily functioning.  \n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs to manage physical symptoms like tremors and GI distress.  \n4. Occupational therapy: Collaborate with HR to create manageable social work goals (e.g., incremental participation in meetings).  \n5. Psychoeducation to normalize somatic symptoms as part of anxiety, reducing catastrophic misinterpretations.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the patient's answers to the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom questions. My job is to analyze their responses and structure the information as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms. The patient talks about losing interest in social activities, feeling low, anxiety, panic, avoidance behaviors, physical symptoms like stomach aches and shaking, and avoidance of social situations. They mentioned not feeling hopeless but having a heavy weight from social obligations. That seems like social anxiety.\n\nNext, looking for patterns. The patient consistently mentions social situations as the trigger for their symptoms. They avoid almost everything social, like parties, promotions requiring presentations, even lunch with coworkers. The physical symptoms all occur in anticipation of social events. The anxiety is pervasive, with daily occurrences, especially before social events. The avoidance is a key pattern here.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Social Anxiety Disorder comes to mind immediately. The DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of social situations, avoidance, and significant distress. The panic symptoms might overlap with panic disorder, but since they\u2019re tied to social contexts, it's more likely part of SAD. The physical symptoms like stomach aches, sweating, shaking are common in anxiety disorders. The avoidance leading to impairment in work (turning down promotions) is a big point. Maybe also Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but the context is social. \n\nRisk factors: The patient is avoiding important life opportunities like career advancement, which could lead to worsening social isolation. They mention snapping at people, though infrequently, which might indicate stress but not necessarily aggression. Physical symptoms are significant and could contribute to somatic complaints. \n\nI should check if there's any suicidal ideation or self-harm, but the answers don't mention that. The main risks are the ongoing impairment in social functioning and possible comorbid anxiety issues. \n\nNow, putting this into the clinical summary points. Need to make sure to use professional terms. Main symptoms: social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, physical symptoms. Patterns: social triggers, avoidance behaviors. Clinical significance: Social Anxiety Disorder, possible GAD. Risk factors: occupational impairment, social withdrawal. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any points. They mentioned panic attacks? They had panic-like symptoms in crowded places, so that's a possible Panic Disorder, but again, it's context-specific. Since it's tied to social situations, it's part of SAD. \n\nAlso, they don't mention any manic symptoms, so no bipolar. Their sleep issues are insomnia due to worry, not from mania. They don't have increased energy, so risk of bipolar is low here. \n\nSo the summary should list SAD as primary, note the physical symptoms, the avoidance leading to occupational issues, and the anxiety's pervasive nature. Risk factors include the ongoing avoidance and physical symptoms. \n\nMake sure the summary is concise, using terms like \"persistent social avoidance,\" \"anticipatory anxiety,\" \"somatic symptoms,\" and \"occupational impairment.\" \n\nI think that's all. Let me structure each part step by step as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- Persistent **social withdrawal** and avoidance of interpersonal interactions (Q1, Q8).  \n- **Chronic anxiety** and **anticipatory anxiety** related to social situations (Q6, Q7, Q8).  \n- **Physical manifestations of anxiety** (e.g., tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress, tremors, blushing) triggered by social demands (Q7, Q9).  \n- **Low mood and emotional distress** tied to social performance anxiety (Q2).  \n- **Functional impairment** in occupational and interpersonal domains (e.g., declining promotions, avoiding social obligations).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Social context dependency**: Symptoms (anxiety, avoidance, physical manifestations) are consistently triggered by anticipated or actual social engagement.  \n- **Intensity gradient**: Symptoms escalate with perceived social scrutiny (e.g., promotions, group activities).  \n- **Body-mind somatization**: Physical complaints (e.g., headaches, stomach aches) are directly linked to social anxiety.  \n- **Denial of anger/mania**: No endorsement of irritability, aggression, or elevated energy (Q3, Q4, Q5).  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Endorsement of fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of social situations, and interference with functioning (Q1, Q6\u2013Q9).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Chronic, excessive anxiety about social performance (Q2, Q6).  \n- **Physical comorbidities**: Somatization of anxiety (Q9.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Occupational impairment**: Avoidance of professional advancement due to social demands (Q8.  \n- **Social isolation**: Progressive withdrawal from relationships and communal activities (Q1, Q8.  \n- **Physical symptom exacerbation**: Cardiovascular (tachycardia) and gastrointestinal distress (Q6, Q7, Q9.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nPatient presents with **clinically significant social anxiety** marked by persistent anticipatory anxiety, avoidance of social/performative situations, and somatic symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress) triggered by interpersonal demands. Symptoms align with **DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder**, with moderate functional impairment in occupational and relational domains. No acute risk of self-harm/ideation noted. Further evaluation for comorbid GAD and somatization is warranted. Symptom triggers are consistently social in nature, suggesting a primary anxiety disorder with context-specific exacerbations.",

However, some domains like psychosis (Q12, Q13), repetitive thoughts/behaviors (Q16, Q17), dissociation (Q18), identity and relationships (Q19, Q20), and substance use (Q21-Q23) were either not directly asked or not sufficiently explored. For example, the therapist did not specifically inquire about psychotic symptoms or detailed substance use patterns. While the focus was primarily on anxiety and depression, the coverage was generally comprehensive but with some notable omissions.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. However, there were moments where the questions could have been more precise or comprehensive. For instance, when the patient mentioned panic-like symptoms, the therapist could have explored this further using more specific DSM-5 aligned language. Additionally, some questions were slightly rephrased but remained clinically relevant. Overall, the questions were closely aligned with clinical criteria, but minor inaccuracies existed.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively built on the patient's disclosures, creating a coherent and smooth conversational arc. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist maintained a consistent and relevant line of inquiry, adapting to the patient's responses appropriately.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with somatic comorbidities clearly aligns with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked specific symptoms (e.g., persistent fear of social evaluation, avoidance behaviors, physical manifestations) to DSM-5 criteria. The reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was well-stated and clinically sound. Alternative diagnoses were implicitly considered by ruling out primary depression or mania, and the focus on anxiety-mediated somatic symptoms was justified.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, using a warm and personalized tone. For example, noting the patient's description of feeling like 'my body betrays me' in stressful situations underscores the therapist's empathy and understanding. The interactions were professional, yet conveyed a sense of genuine concern for the patient's well-being."

      "predicted": "<sym>Little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> in social settings, persistent <sym>avoidance of social obligations</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like trembling and stomach aches were consistently linked to anticipated judgment during interactions. Your description of feeling like <quote>\"my body betrays me\"</quote> in stressful situations underscores how deeply this distress impacts your daily life.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with somatic comorbidities  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s **persistent fear of social evaluation** (evident in Q1, Q8), **avoidance behaviors** (e.g., declining promotions, avoiding coworkers), and **physical manifestations** (tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress per Q9) align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> DSM-5 criteria. <sym>Panic-like symptoms</sym> (Q7) are contextualized by feared social triggers, not standalone panic attacks. <sym>Lack of energy</sym> (Q4) and <sym>low mood</sym> (Q2) reflect secondary distress from social impairment rather than primary depression or mania. Somatic symptoms are anxiety-mediated (<med>somatization</med>), not indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as they are directly tied to anxiety.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** focusing on social anxiety, including exposure therapy to gradually reduce avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) if symptoms interfere with daily functioning.  \n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs to manage physical symptoms like tremors and GI distress.  \n4. Occupational therapy: Collaborate with HR to create manageable social work goals (e.g., incremental participation in meetings).  \n5. Psychoeducation to normalize somatic symptoms as part of anxiety, reducing catastrophic misinterpretations.",
