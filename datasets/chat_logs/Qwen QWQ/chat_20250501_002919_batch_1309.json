          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's start by going through each of the patient's answers to the DSM-5 questions one by one. The user provided all the Q&As, so I need to parse each response for symptoms and any red flags.\n\nFirst, the patient mentions little interest or pleasure in activities despite doing them. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, which is common in depression. Then they talk about feeling down after social interactions, which might point to social anxiety or depression. The irritation is minimal, so maybe not bipolar or something with anger issues. \n\nSleep issues: trouble falling asleep, waking up tired. That's insomnia combined with non-restorative sleep. They mentioned lying awake worrying, which is anxiety-related. \n\nNo risky behaviors, which is good, but avoiding social situations a lot. The anxiety symptoms are significant: nervousness, panic attacks, avoidance, physical symptoms like sweating, blushing, chest tightness. Those are textbook social anxiety disorder symptoms. \n\nThe physical symptoms during social interactions (aches, etc.) are somatic symptoms, which often accompany anxiety. They feel their symptoms aren't taken seriously by their doctor, which could be a point to address in treatment. \n\nNo self-harm intent except the \"wish to disappear,\" which isn't an active plan. No psychosis symptoms like hearing voices or delusions. Memory problems? They mention getting distracted and blanking in social settings, which could be anxiety-induced. \n\nRepetitive negative thoughts about social situations are definitely part of social anxiety, maybe OCD tendencies, but it's more likely the anxiety disorder. \n\nNow, compiling the main symptoms: anhedonia, depressed mood, social anxiety, somatic symptoms, sleep disturbance, panic attacks, avoidance behavior. \n\nPatterns: all centered around social interactions triggering anxiety and physical symptoms, leading to avoidance. The constant worry and rumination are persistent. \n\nClinical significance areas: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is possible because of anhedonia and low mood. But the primary issue seems Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with panic attacks and significant functional impairment due to avoidance. Also, possible Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) given the constant nervousness. \n\nRisk factors: The patient isn't currently suicidal, but the distress from anxiety could impact their quality of life. They might need CBT for social anxiety, maybe SSRIs. The doctor not taking their symptoms seriously could affect treatment adherence. \n\nWait, but the question says to list potential clinical significance areas. So SAD is definite, maybe comorbid with GAD and MDD. The sleep issues could be part of either. The physical symptoms are somatic, but linked to anxiety. \n\nAlso, the repetitive thoughts about social interactions point to rumination, which is common in anxiety disorders. Need to make sure it's not OCD, but the patient's focus is on social evaluation, so OCD might not be the main issue here. \n\nRisk factors: the impact on daily functioning (avoiding meetings, parties) is a major concern. The wish to disappear is a non-suicidal ideation, but not active. No psychosis, so that's ruled out. \n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are social anxiety with panic attacks, significant social avoidance, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Maybe a depressive component too, but the primary issue is the social anxiety causing functional impairment. The sleep issues and somatic symptoms are part of the anxiety. \n\nThe clinician should also note the patient's awareness of their symptoms and willingness to answer, which is good for treatment. The doctor's dismissal could be a barrier. \n\nI need to structure this into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a summary. \n\nWait, for potential areas of clinical significance, that's where the disorders go, like Social Anxiety Disorder, GAD, possible MDD. \n\nRisk factors or warning signs: maybe the impact on daily life, but no current suicidal intent. The physical symptoms that aren't taken seriously might contribute to under-treatment. \n\nOkay, let me structure this step by step according to the user's instructions. Make sure to use professional terms without speculation. Don't mention things not mentioned, like psychosis since they said no to voices. \n\nMain symptoms: anhedonia, depressed mood post-social interactions, high anxiety/nervousness, panic attacks in social contexts, avoidance of social situations, somatic symptoms (tremors, sweating, chest tightness), sleep disturbance, cognitive symptoms (overthinking, rumination), social impairment. \n\nPatterns: All symptoms exacerbated or triggered by social interactions. Persistent anxiety with physical manifestations. High level of avoidance leading to functional impairment. \n\nClinical significance: Social Anxiety Disorder (with panic attacks), possible major depressive features (but need more info on duration and severity of depression), GAD, and adjustment disorder if the stressor is recent. \n\nRisk factors: The doctor's dismissal might affect engagement in treatment. The patient's avoidance could lead to worsening social isolation. The somatic symptoms not being taken seriously could lead to mistrust in medical professionals. \n\nAvoiding mentioning anything not there, like substance use or suicidal intent beyond the \"wish to disappear\" which isn't an active plan. \n\nAlright, time to format this into the required sections using clinical terms.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anhedonia**: Reduced interest/pleasure in activities despite engagement.  \n- **Depressed mood**: Intensified after social interactions.  \n- **Anxiety symptoms**: Chronic nervousness, restlessness, and somatic symptoms (tremors, sweating, chest tightness) triggered by social situations.  \n- **Panic attacks**: Acute episodes during social demands (e.g., public speaking).  \n- **Avoidance behavior**: Systematic avoidance of social situations (meetings, parties) to reduce anxiety.  \n- **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia with delayed sleep onset due to ruminative worry.  \n- **Cognitive symptoms**: Social-interaction-related rumination (e.g., replaying conversations, fear of embarrassment).  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance impacts occupational and social functioning (e.g., skipping meetings, isolating self).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Social specificity**: Symptoms are consistently exacerbated by anticipated/perceived social evaluation.  \n- **Cognitive-affective cycle**: Worry about social interactions \u2192 physical symptoms \u2192 avoidance \u2192 further dysphoria.  \n- **Self-reported under-recognition**: Patient perceives their somatic symptoms as dismissed by medical providers.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Areas of Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Dominant presentation with panic attacks, avoidance, and somatic symptoms.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Chronic anxiety and hyperarousal (restlessness, overthinking).  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Subthreshold anhedonia and dysphoric mood require longitudinal assessment for full criteria.  \n- **Avoidant Personality Disorder**: Consider with persistent avoidance of social interaction due to fear of criticism.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety/Depressed Mood**: If symptoms are time-locked to identifiable stressor (unconfirmed).  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Functional impairment**: Significant social and occupational withdrawal.  \n- **Chronicity**: Symptoms reported as ongoing over the past two weeks, suggesting persistent distress.  \n- **Secondary concerns**: Possible somatic symptom disorder (SSD) if physical symptoms are excessive/distressing despite reassurance.  \n- **Treatment compliance risk**: Prior dismissal of symptoms by medical providers may reduce trust in current evaluation.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient demonstrates a constellation of symptoms consistent with **Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23)** with panic attacks, likely comorbid with **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02)** due to pervasive nervousness and overthinking. Anhedonia and dysphoria post-social interactions suggest **subsyndromal depressive features** requiring further evaluation for MDD. Somatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, sweating) are contextually linked to anticipatory anxiety and may reflect autonomic arousal secondary to social phobia. **Avoidant behavior** significantly impacts functional capacity, and the patient\u2019s perception of under-recognition of their symptoms by medical staff may necessitate collaborative care to address trust and validation. No acute suicidal or psychotic features.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Formal diagnostic evaluation for SAD, GAD, and MDD.  \n- Cognitive-behavioral assessment for social anxiety triggers and safety behaviors.  \n- Sleep hygiene evaluation and management.  \n- Exploration of prior medical interactions to address perceived invalidation.  \n- Consider empiric trial of SSRIs and CBT targeting social anxiety and avoidance.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Structured clinical interview (e.g., SCID-5) to confirm diagnostic thresholds for SAD, GAD, and MDD.  \n- Functional assessment of occupational/social impairment.  \n- Physical exam to rule out medical contributors to sleep disturbances.  \n\nThis summary is provisional and requires confirmation via further clinical evaluation.",
