      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through the user's responses again to make sure I capture everything. The person is clearly struggling with social situations. They avoid parties and even turned down promotions because of social demands. The physical symptoms like racing heart, shaking, and headaches when anxious are classic for social anxiety. They mention feeling detached, which might be depersonalization, possibly from extreme anxiety.\n\nI need to check DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder. The avoidance and fear of negative evaluation are key here. They don't have depression symptoms, except maybe a bit of sadness about missing out on social connections. \n\nThe dissociative symptoms like feeling detached could be part of the anxiety response, not necessarily a separate disorder unless it's more severe. Since they didn't mention trauma, PTSD doesn't fit. The panic attacks during social events meet panic disorder criteria too, but the primary issue seems centered on social interactions. \n\nThey mentioned occasional alcohol use to cope, which is a red flag but not at a harmful level yet. The repetitive thoughts about social situations (like fearing saying something stupid) align with obsessive worries, but without compulsions, so OCD might not fit. \n\nThe key here is Social Anxiety Disorder. The avoidance is causing real impairment in work and social life. The dissociation could be a specifier under SAD. I should also note the panic attacks as a possible comorbidity. The recommended steps would include therapy like CBT, medication options, and addressing the coping mechanisms.\n\nWait, the user's answer to Q19 mentions feeling detached, which is depersonalization. That could be part of the anxiety response. The DSM-5 allows for that under SAD if it's triggered by social stress. Also, the repetitive thoughts (Q16 and Q17) are anxiety-related rumination. \n\nSubstance use is minimal, so not a primary issue. The main diagnosis is clear. I should structure the sections exactly as requested, making sure to use the tags properly. Double-check the DSM-5 criteria for SAD to confirm all points are met. The patient's avoidance and distress in social settings, along with physiological symptoms, fit perfectly. \n\nOkay, the diagnosis should be Social Anxiety Disorder. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Dissociative symptoms might be under the anxiety umbrella here. No signs of depression except mild sadness about social isolation, but not meeting full MDD criteria. Alright, time to format the response as specified.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms suggestive of significant social anxiety</sym> deeply impact your daily life, including work and relationships.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's start by going through each of the patient's answers one by one. The first thing I notice is how they responded to questions about mood and energy. For Q2, they said they don\u2019t have much interest or pleasure, but they clarified it's more about preferring solitude rather than depression. That\u2019s a bit conflicting because avoiding social situations can sometimes be a sign of depression, but they don't feel hopeless. \n\nMoving to Q3 about feeling down, they mentioned feeling low when thinking about socializing, but not hopeless. That might be more related to anxiety about social interactions rather than a depressive episode. \n\nIn Q4, they mentioned irritability around social plans but back out instead of getting angry. This could be avoidant behavior. \n\nSleep issues in Q15: they oversleep to avoid the day, which could indicate avoidance behavior or possible insomnia with hypersomnia. \n\nThe key points start coming up around questions about anxiety. Q7 and Q8 really stand out. They have noticeable anxiety before events with physical symptoms like racing heart, shaking, and headaches. They avoid social situations, which is a big red flag for social anxiety disorder. The avoidance of promotions and using sick days to avoid parties is a significant pattern. \n\nQ9 mentions physical symptoms like stomach issues and headaches before social events, which are common in anxiety disorders. \n\nQuestion 16 talks about spacing out during conversations, which might be dissociation. They mentioned feeling detached in Q18, which is depersonalization/derealization, often linked to anxiety or trauma. \n\nQ17 and Q18 mention repetitive thoughts and mental rehearsal, which sounds like obsessive-compulsive tendencies, maybe. \n\nThe key here is to see the pattern of social anxiety, avoidance, physical symptoms, and some dissociative experiences. The lack of suicidal ideation (Q11 says no, but in Q11 it's about feeling illnesses aren't taken seriously, so the suicide question is Q21? Wait, looking again, Q11 is about feeling illnesses aren't taken seriously, and the suicide question is Q12? Wait, no: the user's answers go up to Q24 which is Q23 in the questionnaire. Let me check the numbering again. \n\nWait, the user listed Q1 to Q24, where each Q corresponds to the DSM-5 CSM. Wait, the actual DSM-5 CSM for adults has 23 items, so Q1 to Q23. The user's Q24 is the 23rd item. Let me confirm the numbering. \n\nLooking at the questions: \n\nQ2 is the first symptom (little interest or pleasure), so the order matches. The key points are the anxiety symptoms, avoidance, physical symptoms, and dissociation. \n\nThey also mentioned using alcohol occasionally (Q21) but not daily, so some substance use as a coping mechanism. \n\nNo psychosis (Q12 and Q13 negative), so that's ruled out. \n\nNo suicidal intent beyond wanting to disappear (non-suicidal self-injury thoughts?), but they denied actual plans. \n\nPutting this all together, the main diagnosis seems to be Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of social situations where they might be scrutinized, leading to avoidance, and significant distress. The physical symptoms (trembling, panic attacks), avoidance, and the impact on their life (turning down promotions) fit. \n\nAdditionally, the dissociative experiences (feeling detached) might be part of the anxiety response. The repetitive thoughts (Q16, Q17) could be part of the anxiety or maybe OCD traits, but without compulsions. \n\nThe sleep disturbances (oversleeping to avoid) are part of the avoidance behavior. The substance use (occasional alcohol) is a maladaptive coping strategy. \n\nPotential areas of clinical significance: social anxiety with possible comorbid generalized anxiety disorder? Also the dissociation could be an avoidant response or PTSD, but without trauma history mentioned here, maybe it's part of the anxiety. \n\nRisk factors: occasional substance use (though low frequency), impact on occupational functioning (turning down promotions), social isolation. \n\nThey don\u2019t mention trauma, so maybe not PTSD, but the dissociation is worth noting. \n\nSo the main points are social anxiety, high anxiety symptoms, avoidance, physical manifestations, and some dissociative symptoms. Need to structure the summary under the categories given.\n</think>\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Symptoms:** Significant avoidance of social interactions, including refusal of promotions requiring teamwork, use of \"sick days\" to avoid social events, and marked anxiety (e.g., panic attacks, physiological symptoms like tachycardia, tremors, and headaches) in social/performance situations.  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent nervousness, anticipatory anxiety (e.g., \"looping\" thoughts of social failure), and physical manifestations (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, headaches).  \n- **Dissociative Experiences:** Feelings of detachment (depersonalization/derealization) during group interactions.  \n- **Maladaptive Coping:** Occasional alcohol use to manage social anxiety.  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance impacts occupational advancement and social relationships.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Avoidance as a primary coping strategy** for anxiety provocation (e.g., declining promotions, avoiding social events).  \n- **Cognitive distortions** (e.g., catastrophic thinking about social interactions: \"What if I say something stupid?\").  \n- **Denial or minimization** of distress (\"I'm just lazy,\" \"maybe I'm overthinking\").  \n- **Physical symptoms** consistently tied to social/performance situations.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Widespread avoidance and anticipatory anxiety consistent with DSM-5 criteria.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive anxiety about social performance, persistent worry about social judgment.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** Panic attacks in social/performance contexts (Q7, Q8).  \n- **Possible Avoidant Personality Disorder:** Chronic social inhibition and hypersensitivity to criticism.  \n- **Subthreshold Dissociative Symptoms:** Depersonalization during anxiety provocation.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social and occupational impairment** due to avoidance.  \n- **Occasional substance use** (alcohol) for social anxiety, though infrequent.  \n- **Self-criticism and impaired self-esteem** (\"wish I could disappear\").  \n- **Functional decline** in social and work domains.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **marked social anxiety symptomatology**, including anticipatory anxiety, avoidance of social/performance situations, and associated physiological symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress). Avoidance behaviors (e.g., declining promotions, using \"sick days\" to avoid social obligations) significantly impair functioning. Co-occurring features include **generalized anxiety** (catastrophic thinking about social interactions), **panic attacks**, and **subthreshold dissociative symptoms** (depersonalization during anxiety provocation). The patient minimizes distress but acknowledges significant impairment. Maladaptive coping (occasional alcohol use) and **cognitive distortions** (e.g., \"looping\" thoughts about social failure) are prominent. No acute suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms. The profile aligns strongly with **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**, with possible comorbid GAD and avoidant personality features. Further assessment is warranted for dissociative experiences and occupational/social impact.",

Your efforts to manage this\u2014such as isolatinging or using alcohol in moderation\u2014highlight your struggle to cope, even as you dismiss some experiences as \"being lazy\" or \"overthinking.\" You clearly care about connecting with others but feel trapped by fear.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with Panic Attack specifier</med>; <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> features noted.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s <sym>avoidance of social/performance situations</sym>, <sym>physiological arousal (elevated heart rate, trembling)</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> align with <med>SAD</med> criteria per DSM-5 (persistent fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and functional impairment). <sym>Depersonalization</sym> during social interactions and <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym> (Q16-17) suggest <med>GAD</med>, as anxiety generalizes to anticipating social risks. No evidence of trauma or psychosis, ruling out PTSD or schizophrenia.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (<med>CBT</med>):** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoidance) and distorted social beliefs through exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring.  \n2. **Adjunctive Medication:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>beta-blockers</med> for acute social situations to reduce physiological arousal.  \n3. **Mindfulness/Relaxation Training:** Practice grounding techniques to address <sym>depersonalization</sym> and panic.  \n4. **Limit Alcohol Use:** Replace with non-substance coping strategies (e.g., deep breathing) to avoid dependency.  \n5. **Occupational Therapy:** Gradual exposure to low-stakes work interactions to rebuild confidence.  \n\nThis structured approach can help address the cycle of fear and avoidance while addressing <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym>.
