      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the user's answers again. The patient is clearly avoiding social situations because of fear of judgment. They mentioned avoiding meetings and parties, feeling anxious in groups, and physical symptoms like clammy hands and panic. That points towards social anxiety.\n\nThe answers for questions 1-10 highlight avoidance and social discomfort. The physical symptoms like chest tightness and panic in crowds could be panic disorder features. But the core is the social anxiety. The DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23) fit here because they fear negative evaluation, avoid social interactions, and have physiological symptoms. \n\nLooking at question 3, they don't have anger, just tension. So no signs of conduct issues. The panic in crowded places (Q8) might be a specific phobia, but it's tied to social situations, so it's part of SAD. The sleep issues from worrying (Q14) are common in anxiety. No substance use (Q21-23) so that's ruled out. \n\nThey mentioned depersonalation during social events (Q18), which can occur in severe anxiety but isn't a separate diagnosis here. The avoidance and fear of scrutiny are key. The lack of mood symptoms like guilt or worthlessness (Q2) makes depression less likely. \n\nSo the main diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder. The reasoning should cover how their responses align with DSM-5 criteria. The next steps would be CBT, maybe SSRIs, and social skills training. I need to format this correctly with the sections and tags as specified. Let me structure it step by step, making sure to include the required sections and tags.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms of social anxiety and avoidance</sym> deeply resonate in your responses.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed set of responses from a patient's questionnaire. My job is to analyze them step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms and concerns. Looking at the answers, the patient talks about little interest in group activities, feeling anxious in social situations, avoiding social interactions, physical symptoms like restlessness and panic in crowds, sleep issues due to worry, and social avoidance. So, social anxiety comes up a lot here.\n\nNext, the patterns in responses. The patient consistently mentions social situations causing distress\u2014they avoid meetings, parties, and groups. They also report physical symptoms tied to anxiety, like muscle tension and panic in crowds. The avoidance is a recurring theme, and they mention hypervigilance about others' perceptions, which is classic for social anxiety.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance. The DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are definitely present here: fear of judgment, avoidance behaviors, social interactions causing anxiety, and physical symptoms. The sleep issues could be linked to anxiety too, maybe insomnia due to rumination. The detached feeling during social events (depersonalization) might be part of the anxiety response. The lack of substance use is a positive note, but the avoidance is significant.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs. The patient doesn't mention self-harm or suicidal thoughts, but they do have panic attacks in certain situations. The constant social avoidance might be affecting their quality of life, relationships, and possibly work if they're skipping meetings. The physical symptoms when anxious are important too.\n\nNow, summarizing in clinical terms. The symptoms align with SAD, with possible comorbid anxiety features. Need to note the avoidance, physical symptoms, and impact on daily functioning. Also, the absence of psychotic symptoms or substance use is worth mentioning.\n\nWait, check Q12 and Q13: the patient denies hearing voices but has paranoia about others' opinions. That's more cognitive distortions from anxiety. The hypervigilance and rumination are key points. Also, the depersonalization during events might indicate high anxiety states.\n\nMake sure not to miss anything. The patient's answers are consistent, no inconsistency in responses. They\u2019re aware of their issues but haven't sought help before, which is a point since they\u2019re now reaching out. The fact that they\u2019ve never used substances is a plus. \n\nRisk factors: the anxiety is impacting their social functioning and possibly their work. The panic attacks in crowded places are a red flag. They don't have self-harm, so that's lower risk, but chronic anxiety can lead to other issues if untreated.\n\nPutting it all together, the main diagnosis would be Social Anxiety Disorder with associated anxiety features. The summary needs to be concise and use the right terms like avoidance behaviors, social performance fears, physiological symptoms, etc. Mention the DSM-5 criteria they meet. Also, note the functional impairment in social and occupational areas.\n\nDouble-check the points: avoidance of social interactions, fear of negative evaluation, physical symptoms, sleep disturbance, and depersonalization during stress. No substance use, no psychosis. That should cover it. Alright, time to structure the response as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent avoidance of group/social interactions, fear of judgment, and heightened self-consciousness in social settings. Reports of social withdrawal (skipping meetings, declining gatherings).  \n- **Anxiety-Related Physical Symptoms:** Muscle tension, chest tightness, lightheadedness, and panic-like sensations in crowded or interactive situations.  \n- **Cognitive Distortions:** Intrusive worries about social performance (e.g., replaying conversations, fearing criticism).  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Difficulty falling/asleep due to rumination about social interactions.  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance behaviors impacting relationships, social engagement, and potential occupational functioning.  \n\n**2. Response Patterns:**  \n- **Consistent Self-Report of Avoidance:** Repeated emphasis on avoiding social/performative situations (e.g., meetings, parties) to mitigate anxiety.  \n- **Body Awareness in Anxiety Contexts:** Physical symptoms (e.g., clammy hands, chest tightness) are consistently linked to social interactions.  \n- **Non-psychotic, Reality-Tested Concerns:** Reports of social scrutiny (e.g., fearing others laugh at them) without delusions or perceptual distortions.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Strong alignment with DSM-5 criteria (fear of scrutiny, avoidance, functional impairment).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Chronic worry about social performance and interactions.  \n- **Panic Disorder Features:** Panic-like episodes in crowded settings (e.g., lightheadedness, urgency to leave).  \n- **Agoraphobic Traits:** Avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult (e.g., crowded rooms).  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **High Social Avoidance:** Risk of worsened social isolation and withdrawal.  \n- **Physical Symptoms in Context:** Panic responses in social situations may escalate if unaddressed.  \n- **Poor Coping Strategies:** Overreliance on avoidance rather than adaptive social engagement.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary (DSM-5 Terminology):**  \nThe patient exhibits significant **social anxiety symptoms**, including fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of social/performance situations, and associated physiological reactivity (e.g., tachycardia, lightheadedness). Hypersensitivity to social scrutiny and repetitive negative self-appraisal (e.g., intrusive post-interaction rumination) suggest **social anxiety disorder** (300.23). Anxiety-driven avoidance appears to impair interpersonal/occupational functioning. **Generalized anxiety disorder** (GAD) features are present due to persistent worry about social interactions. Panic-like symptoms in crowds may indicate **specific phobia** (e.g., agoraphobic features. No evidence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance use.  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Prioritize assessment for SAD and GAD via structured clinical interviews (e.g., SCID-5 for SAD.  \n- Evaluate for agoraphobic features and panic disorder.  \n- Address sleep disturbance secondary to anxiety.  \n- Assess readiness for cognitive-behavioral interventions (e.g., CBT for anxiety) and social skills training.  \n\n**Note:** Patient\u2019s proactive engagement and lack of maladaptive coping (no substance use) suggest good treatment prognosis.",

It sounds incredibly challenging to navigate daily life when interactions feel so fraught with fear of judgment.
