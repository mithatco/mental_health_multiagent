      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to provide a professional assessment based on the patient's responses. The instructions are precise, so I need to follow each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to start with a compassionate summary. The patient's answers show depression, paranoia, hallucinations, and OCD behaviors. I should acknowledge their struggles empathetically.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The key here is to determine the primary condition. The patient has psychotic symptoms like hearing voices (Q2, whispering, voices about being a failure), delusions of a medical plot (Q10). The depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness) plus psychosis point to a psychotic disorder with mood features. Schizoaffective disorder comes to mind because it combines mood symptoms and psychotic features. But the criteria require that the psychotic symptoms last for at least 2 weeks when the mood symptoms are not present. The responses here don't clearly indicate if the psychosis occurs outside mood episodes. Alternatively, maybe a psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) or brief psychotic disorder? Wait, but the DSM-5 has schizoaffective disorder where the mood symptoms are concurrent. Alternatively, maybe major depression with psychotic features. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder with psychotic features. The criteria require that delusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive episode. The patient's depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, negative beliefs) are present, and the hallucinations (voices, whispers, paranoia) could be part of that episode. So maybe <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> is a fit. However, the delusions about doctors (Q10) or the voices might not be mood-congruent. Alternatively, if the paranoia is part of a psychotic disorder without mood, but the depression is present. It's a bit tricky. Alternatively, <med>Schizoaffective Disorder</med> if the psychotic symptoms persist beyond the mood episodes. But given the timeframe (two weeks), it's hard to tell. Since the symptoms occurred in the past two weeks and the DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective require that the psychotic symptoms persist for at least two weeks without prominent mood symptoms. The patient's answers include both mood and psychosis overlapping, so maybe major depression with psychotic features is better here. Hmm, need to be precise. Also, the compulsive cleaning (Q5) and checking (Q6) could be OCD, but combined with psychosis complicates it. But OCD with psychotic features is rare, so maybe the primary is the mood or psychotic disorder. \n\nAlso, the patient reports panic (Q7) and anxiety (Q6), Q8), Q9). So mixed symptoms. But the key here is the psychotic features. Since they have hallucinations (whispers, voices) and delusions (doctors part of a plot), the psychotic symptoms are prominent. The depressive symptoms are significant too. So according to DSM-5, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features requires delusions/hallucinations that are mood-congruent (e.g., delusions of worthlessness) or incongruent. The \"voice saying they're a failure\" could be congruent. The delusions about doctors being part of a plot seem incongruent, pointing to a primary psychotic disorder. Alternatively, maybe schizophrenia? However, schizophrenia requires other symptoms like disorganized speech/thought, which aren't clearly here. The duration is only two weeks, which is shorter than the 6 months for schizophrenia. \n\nWait, but the DSM-5 criteria for Schizophrenia require at least one month of active-phase symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, etc.), and the total duration must be at least 6 months. Since the assessment is for the past two weeks, maybe it's too early, so a provisional diagnosis might be more appropriate. However, the symptoms are severe, so maybe a psychotic disorder NOS or brief psychotic disorder. Alternatively, if the delusions and hallucinations are part of a mood episode, then MDD with psychotic features. But the delusions about doctors being in a plot might be non-mood related. \n\nHmm. The DSM-5 category for MDD with psychotic features requires that the delusions/hallucinations are related to the mood symptoms. The voice about being a failure is congruent. The paranoia about doctors being part of a plot is incongruent. So maybe <med>Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type</med> is possible, if the psychotic symptoms persist when mood symptoms improve. But since the duration is still brief, maybe a provisional diagnosis of <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> is better, or <med>Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified</med> pending further evaluation. Alternatively, maybe the primary disorder is Schizophrenia, but duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, considering <med>Delusional Disorder</med> if the delusions are non-bizarre. But the voices and paranoia seem more severe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe <med>Schizotypal Personality Disorder</med> but that's a personality disorder. \n\nHmm, the most likely is that the patient has psychotic symptoms along with depression. Given the timeframe, maybe the best provisional diagnosis is <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> because the depressive symptoms and psychotic features co-occur. \n\nWait, but if the psychotic symptoms occur predominantly without mood symptoms, then it's a primary psychotic disorder. The patient's Q2 mentions a voice saying they're a failure, which could be a hallucination. The delusions about the doctor conspiracy (Q10) are separate from mood. \n\nAlternatively, if the primary issue is a psychotic disorder, perhaps <med>Schizophrenia spectrum</med> but not enough duration. Maybe <med>Brief Psychotic Disorder</med> if acute. \n\nAlternatively, <med>Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</med> but no medical cause mentioned. \n\nHmm. The most fitting based on the symptoms listed would be <med>Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type</med>, as the patient has both mood (depression) and psychotic symptoms. But need to ensure that the psychotic symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks. Since the assessment is only for two weeks, maybe provisional. \n\nAlternatively, given the presence of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, maybe <med>Selct disorder> like Schizophrenia, but duration is too short. \n\nAlternatively, the best fit based on the given data is <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med>, since the depressive symptoms and psychosis are concomitant. \n\nAlternatively, <med>Delusional Disorder</med> with depressive symptoms, but the hallucinations complicate that. \n\nWait, let's look at DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features:\n\n- The presence of major depressive episode\n- At least one delusion, hallucination during the episode\n- The depression and psychosis are concurrent\n\nIn this case, the patient has depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood) and psychotic features (voices, delusions), so that fits. \n\nYes. So the diagnosis would be <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>.\n\nAlternatively, if the delusions are more prominent and not mood-congruent, maybe Schizophrenia, but duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's paranoia about doctors and the voices might be part of a delusional system, but with depression, it's hard to say. The key is to pick the most supported diagnosis based on available data. \n\nI think <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> is the best fit here, given the clear depressive symptoms and the presence of hallucinations/delusions during that time. \n\nNow, moving to next steps: addressing the psychosis and depression, rule out medical causes, involve a psychiatrist, therapy like CBT for cognitive distortions, etc. \n\nOkay, putting it all together following the structure exactly. Need to use the tags properly. Make sure to address all key points and symptoms mentioned, like the OCD aspects (compulsive cleaning and checking), which might be OCD comororbid, but the primary is the psychotic features. \n\nAlso, the delusions about doctors being in a plot (Q10) and the paranoia in Q8 (avoiding stores due to buzzing lights they perceive, which others don't) suggest paranoia. \n\nAlright, structuring:\n\nCompassionate summary: acknowledge their distress, the struggles they're describing, the confusion, etc.\n\nDiagnosis line: Schizoaffective disorder or MDD with psychotic features. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Since the delusions (doctors in a plot, hearing whispers, thinking cracks are real) and hallucinations (voices, whispers) along with depression, and the criteria for schizoaffective require that the psychotic symptoms persist when the depression is not active. But since the assessment is for two weeks, maybe the data isn't enough to say. Alternatively, if the primary issue is the mood with concurrent psychosis, then MDD with psychotic features is better. \n\nYes, given the time frame, MDD with psychotic features is more appropriate. \n\nSo Diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>, with comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (due to compulsive cleaning, checking locks), and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (Q9,10). However, the primary is the mood disorder with psychosis.\n\nThen, reasoning: explain that the key symptoms (depression, hallucinations, delusions, compulsions) point to the diagnosis. \n\nNext steps would include a full psych evaluation, meds (antipsychotics, antidepressants), cognitive behavioral therapy, etc. Need to address safety, given the self-harm thought in Q11 (but the user didn't include that,",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a patient's answers to the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure questions. My job is to analyze these responses and structure the summary as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms. Looking at the answers:\n\nQ1: The patient mentions lack of interest/pleasure, which is anhedonia, a key symptom of depression. The example about baking cookies but stopping shows reduced motivation.\n\nQ2: The voice saying they're a failure sounds like auditory hallucinations or possibly negative self-talk. The hesitation here might indicate uncertainty or shame about experiencing these symptoms.\n\nQ3: Irritability due to external stimuli (neighbor's TV) and distractibility. They mention getting distracted during the question, which might suggest attention issues or anxiety.\n\nQ4: Insomnia with nighttime wakefulness and difficulty resting. The \"whispers in the walls\" could be paranoia or hallucinations. \n\nQ5: Obsessive cleaning (spotless apartment) might point to OCD or anxiety. They clarify it's not risky, but the compulsion is there.\n\nQ6: Checking behaviors (locks five times) suggest possible OCD or anxiety. The patient questions if paranoia counts as anxiety, which might indicate insight or confusion about symptoms.\n\nQ7: Panic but uncertainty about reality (cracks in ceiling). That's a mix of panic disorder and possibly derealization/delusions.\n\nQ8: Avoidance of grocery stores due to sensory issues (buzzing lights) but doubting their perception. Could be sensory sensitivity from anxiety, or paranoia.\n\nQ9: Somatic symptoms (headache) dismissed by a doctor, leading to doubt. The patient questions if they're real or imagined. This could be somatic symptom disorder or delusional beliefs.\n\nQ10: Mistrust in medical professionals about their conditions, fear of a \"plot.\" That's a paranoid ideation, possibly delusional thinking.\n\nNow, patterns: The patient's responses show a mix of depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2) and anxiety (Q6, Q7, Q8). They also have psychotic features like hallucinations (whispers, voices) and paranoia (plot, doubt about symptoms' reality). The uncertainty about their symptoms' validity (ex. Q2, Q6, Q7, Q10) suggests possible insight into their mental state, but maybe some reality testing issues. The somatic concerns and mistrust of medical advice point to somatic symptom disorder or delusional disorder components.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD (due to checking and cleaning), possible psychotic features (delusions, hallucinations), and somatic symptom disorder. The confusion about symptoms could also hint at a thought disorder, which would be a red flag for schizophrenia or a psychotic disorder.\n\nRisk factors: The mistrust in medical professionals (Q10) might affect treatment adherence. The panic-like episodes and anxiety could lead to social withdrawal or worsening symptoms. The delusional content (plot, doctor dishonesty) is concerning and needs to be assessed further. Also, the patient's self-doubt might indicate poor insight, which complicates treatment.\n\nWait, in Q10, they're worried that the medics might be part of a plot, which is a clear paranoid delusion. The hallucinations (whispers, voices) and the somatic symptoms that they don't trust the doctor's diagnosis on could indicate a psychotic disorder, maybe schizoaffective, or schizophrenia, along with depression and anxiety. Also, OCD elements from cleaning and checking behaviors. Need to check if the psychotic symptoms are present for more than a month, but since the assessment is over the past two weeks, that's within the timeframe. However, for a diagnosis like schizophrenia, the duration is at least six months, but given the symptoms, they might need further evaluation. Alternatively, maybe a mood disorder with psychotic features. The depressive symptoms along with the delusions could point to major depression with psychotic features. Also, the anxiety with OCD-like behaviors.\n\nBut the key here is not to diagnose but note the clinical significance. Potential areas to list: depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychotic features (hallucinations, delusions), OCD traits, somatic concerns with mistrust, and possible thought disorder.\n\nRisk factors: The paranoia regarding medical professionals could lead to non-compliance or seeking alternative treatments. The panic episodes (Q7) might indicate anxiety, but the derealization component complicates that. The patient's uncertainty about their symptoms (e.g., the cracks in the ceiling being real?) suggests possible reality distortion. Also, the question about whether paranoia is an anxiety symptom shows they might not fully recognize their symptoms' nature, indicating possible lack of insight.\n\nI need to make sure all the points from each question are covered. Let me go through each question again quickly:\n\nQ1: Anhedonia (depression)\nQ2: Depressed mood and possible hallucinations (voice saying they're a failure, which could be auditory hallucination or self-criticism with delusion of reference)\nQ3: Irritability and distractibility (could be ADHD, but in context of other symptoms, might be part of anxiety or psychotic)\nQ4: Insomnia and possible hallucinations (whispers) and lack of rest. Insomnia with hallucinations are common in psychosis.\nQ5: Obsessive cleaning (OCD), but they don't see it as risky, so maybe OCD, but the compulsion is to reduce anxiety.\nQ6: Checking rituals (locks), which is OCD. However, linking it to paranoia complicates, but it's still within OCD's checking behaviors unless the belief is delusional (e.g., thinking someone is coming in)\nQ7: Panic but questioning reality (derealization or delusion of persecution if they think the ceiling falling is a threat that's not real)\nQ8: Avoidance due to sensory issues (sensitivity to light), but doubting others' perception (others say lights aren't buzzing, but they hear it). Could be sensory processing issues, but also paranoid delusions.\nQ9: Somatic symptoms with mistrust of medical diagnosis, which is classic in somatic symptom disorder, but combined with delusional beliefs that the symptoms are real and doctors are lying. That's a red flag for delusional disorder or psychosis.\nQ10: Paranoid delusions that the doctors are part of a plot, which is a clear delusion of persecution.\n\nSo, putting together, the key points are depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2), psychotic features (auditory hallucinations, paranoia, delusions), OCD behaviors (Q5, Q6), anxiety, and somatic symptoms with delusional beliefs about their legitimacy. The patient's questioning of their own experiences (like the ceiling cracks, the buzzing) shows possible reality distortion and poor insight. The mistrust of medical advice is a big concern for treatment adherence.\n\nPatterns: They question their own perception and the reality of their symptoms, indicating possible reality testing issues. There's a mix of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, along with OCD traits. The mistrust of others (doctors, friend's input) points to paranoia/delusions. The flat affect (life feels flat) and the voices (Q2's \"voice in my head\") are classic signs of psychosis.\n\nPotential areas: MDD with psychotic features, psychotic disorder (maybe schizoaffective?), OCD, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorder with illness anxiety. But the delusions and hallucinations are the most concerning, which point to a psychotic disorder.\n\nRisk factors: The delusional beliefs about doctors (Q10) could lead to non-compliance, and the somatic symptoms with delusions might lead to unnecessary medical visits. The doubt about their reality (Q7, Q8) might also contribute to social withdrawal. Also, the lack of energy (Q4) from insomnia could impair functioning.\n\nI have to make sure not to miss key points. The OCD aspects are there, but the psychotic features are more critical. Also, the anhedonia and depressed mood are part of a depressive episode, but with psychosis, that would be major depression with psychotic features, or a psychotic disorder with depressive symptoms. The OCD behaviors might be comorbid.\n\nI need to structure the summary as per the user's instructions: symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risk factors, summary. Avoid speculation, just note the observed data.\n\nSo, compiling all that into the sections:\n\n1. Symptoms: Anhedonia, depressed mood, self-critical hallucinations, irritability, insomnia, compulsive cleaning, anxiety with checking, panic with reality distortion, avoidance, somatic symptoms with delusional beliefs, paranoia about medical professionals.\n\n2. Patterns: Mixture of depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms; recurrent doubt about their own perception and reality; ritualistic behaviors (checking, cleaning); mistrust of external validation of their experiences.\n\n3. Clinical areas: Major Depressive Episode with psychotic features, possible delusional disorder, OCD, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder with illness anxiety, paranoia.\n\n4. Risks: Delusional beliefs leading to treatment non-adherence, possible social withdrawal, misinterpretation of reality (could lead to dangerous actions?), and comorbid conditions complicating diagnosis.\n\nWait, in Q7, they mention panic but uncertainty about reality. That could also be derealization, which is part of anxiety or psychosis. The key here is the delusions (voices, plots, etc.) which are clinically significant.\n\nAlso, the constant questioning of their own reality shows poor insight, which is a risk for not recognizing their illness, leading to non-compliance.\n\nOkay, time to put this into the required sections without speculation, just based on their answers.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1.

Alternatively, if the delusions and hallucinations are part of a mood episode, then MDD with psychotic features. But the delusions about doctors being in a plot might be non-mood related. \n\nHmm. The DSM-5 category for MDD with psychotic features requires that the delusions/hallucinations are related to the mood symptoms. The voice about being a failure is congruent. The paranoia about doctors being part of a plot is incongruent. So maybe <med>Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type</med> is possible, if the psychotic symptoms persist when mood symptoms improve. But since the duration is still brief, maybe a provisional diagnosis of <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> is better, or <med>Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified</med> pending further evaluation. Alternatively, maybe the primary disorder is Schizophrenia, but duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, considering <med>Delusional Disorder</med> if the delusions are non-bizarre. But the voices and paranoia seem more severe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe <med>Schizotypal Personality Disorder</med> but that's a personality disorder. \n\nHmm, the most likely is that the patient has psychotic symptoms along with depression. Given the timeframe, maybe the best provisional diagnosis is <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> because the depressive symptoms and psychotic features co-occur. \n\nWait, but if the psychotic symptoms occur predominantly without mood symptoms, then it's a primary psychotic disorder. The patient's Q2 mentions a voice saying they're a failure, which could be a hallucination. The delusions about the doctor conspiracy (Q10) are separate from mood. \n\nAlternatively, if the primary issue is a psychotic disorder, perhaps <med>Schizophrenia spectrum</med> but not enough duration. Maybe <med>Brief Psychotic Disorder</med> if acute. \n\nAlternatively, <med>Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</med> but no medical cause mentioned. \n\nHmm. The most fitting based on the symptoms listed would be <med>Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type</med>, as the patient has both mood (depression) and psychotic symptoms. But need to ensure that the psychotic symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks. Since the assessment is only for two weeks, maybe provisional. \n\nAlternatively, given the presence of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, maybe <med>Selct disorder> like Schizophrenia, but duration is too short. \n\nAlternatively, the best fit based on the given data is <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med>, since the depressive symptoms and psychosis are concomitant. \n\nAlternatively, <med>Delusional Disorder</med> with depressive symptoms, but the hallucinations complicate that. \n\nWait, let's look at DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features:\n\n- The presence of major depressive episode\n- At least one delusion, hallucination during the episode\n- The depression and psychosis are concurrent\n\nIn this case, the patient has depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood) and psychotic features (voices, delusions), so that fits. \n\nYes. So the diagnosis would be <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>.\n\nAlternatively, if the delusions are more prominent and not mood-congruent, maybe Schizophrenia, but duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's paranoia about doctors and the voices might be part of a delusional system, but with depression, it's hard to say. The key is to pick the most supported diagnosis based on available data. \n\nI think <med>Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features</med> is the best fit here, given the clear depressive symptoms and the presence of hallucinations/delusions during that time. \n\nNow, moving to next steps: addressing the psychosis and depression, rule out medical causes, involve a psychiatrist, therapy like CBT for cognitive distortions, etc. \n\nOkay, putting it all together following the structure exactly. Need to use the tags properly. Make sure to address all key points and symptoms mentioned, like the OCD aspects (compulsive cleaning and checking), which might be OCD comororbid, but the primary is the psychotic features. \n\nAlso, the delusions about doctors being in a plot (Q10) and the paranoia in Q8 (avoiding stores due to buzzing lights they perceive, which others don't) suggest paranoia. \n\nAlright, structuring:\n\nCompassionate summary: acknowledge their distress, the struggles they're describing, the confusion, etc.\n\nDiagnosis line: Schizoaffective disorder or MDD with psychotic features. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Since the delusions (doctors in a plot, hearing whispers, thinking cracks are real) and hallucinations (voices, whispers) along with depression, and the criteria for schizoaffective require that the psychotic symptoms persist when the depression is not active. But since the assessment is for two weeks, maybe the data isn't enough to say. Alternatively, if the primary issue is the mood with concurrent psychosis, then MDD with psychotic features is better. \n\nYes, given the time frame, MDD with psychotic features is more appropriate. \n\nSo Diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>, with comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (due to compulsive cleaning, checking locks), and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (Q9,10). However, the primary is the mood disorder with psychosis.\n\nThen, reasoning: explain that the key symptoms (depression, hallucinations, delusions, compulsions) point to the diagnosis. \n\nNext steps would include a full psych evaluation, meds (antipsychotics, antidepressants), cognitive behavioral therapy, etc. Need to address safety, given the self-harm thought in Q11 (but the user didn't include that,",

The instructions are precise, so I need to follow each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to start with a compassionate summary. The patient's answers show depression, paranoia, hallucinations, and OCD behaviors. I should acknowledge their struggles empathetically.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The key here is to determine the primary condition. The patient has psychotic symptoms like hearing voices (Q2, whispering, voices about being a failure), delusions of a medical plot (Q10). The depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness) plus psychosis point to a psychotic disorder with mood features. Schizoaffective disorder comes to mind because it combines mood symptoms and psychotic features. But the criteria require that the psychotic symptoms last for at least 2 weeks when the mood symptoms are not present. The responses here don't clearly indicate if the psychosis occurs outside mood episodes. Alternatively, maybe a psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) or brief psychotic disorder? Wait, but the DSM-5 has schizoaffective disorder where the mood symptoms are concurrent. Alternatively, maybe major depression with psychotic features. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder with psychotic features. The criteria require that delusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive episode. The patient's depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, negative beliefs) are present, and the hallucinations (voices, whispers, paranoia) could be part of that episode. So maybe <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> is a fit. However, the delusions about doctors (Q10) or the voices might not be mood-congruent. Alternatively, if the paranoia is part of a psychotic disorder without mood, but the depression is present. It's a bit tricky. Alternatively, <med>Schizoaffective Disorder</med> if the psychotic symptoms persist beyond the mood episodes. But given the timeframe (two weeks), it's hard to tell. Since the symptoms occurred in the past two weeks and the DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective require that the psychotic symptoms persist for at least two weeks without prominent mood symptoms. The patient's answers include both mood and psychosis overlapping, so maybe major depression with psychotic features is better here. Hmm, need to be precise. Also, the compulsive cleaning (Q5) and checking (Q6) could be OCD, but combined with psychosis complicates it. But OCD with psychotic features is rare, so maybe the primary is the mood or psychotic disorder. \n\nAlso, the patient reports panic (Q7) and anxiety (Q6), Q8), Q9). So mixed symptoms. But the key here is the psychotic features. Since they have hallucinations (whispers, voices) and delusions (doctors part of a plot), the psychotic symptoms are prominent. The depressive symptoms are significant too. So according to DSM-5, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features requires delusions/hallucinations that are mood-congruent (e.g., delusions of worthlessness) or incongruent. The \"voice saying they're a failure\" could be congruent. The delusions about doctors being part of a plot seem incongruent, pointing to a primary psychotic disorder. Alternatively, maybe schizophrenia? However, schizophrenia requires other symptoms like disorganized speech/thought, which aren't clearly here. The duration is only two weeks, which is shorter than the 6 months for schizophrenia. \n\nWait, but the DSM-5 criteria for Schizophrenia require at least one month of active-phase symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, etc.), and the total duration must be at least 6 months. Since the assessment is for the past two weeks, maybe it's too early, so a provisional diagnosis might be more appropriate. However, the symptoms are severe, so maybe a psychotic disorder NOS or brief psychotic disorder. Alternatively, if the delusions and hallucinations are part of a mood episode, then MDD with psychotic features. But the delusions about doctors being in a plot might be non-mood related. \n\nHmm. The DSM-5 category for MDD with psychotic features requires that the delusions/hallucinations are related to the mood symptoms. The voice about being a failure is congruent. The paranoia about doctors being part of a plot is incongruent.

Maybe <med>Brief Psychotic Disorder</med> if acute. \n\nAlternatively, <med>Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition</med> but no medical cause mentioned. \n\nHmm.
