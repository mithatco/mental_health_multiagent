Today we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for adults. This will help me understand your experiences over the past two weeks. Everything you share is confidential, and there are no right or wrong answers. I'll ask each question one by one, and I encourage you to share openly. Let's start with the first question: How much have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two weeks?"

      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants a structured assessment based on the provided responses and observations. First, I need to make sure I follow the exact format they specified. The user mentioned using specific tags and sections. Let me start by reading through the responses again carefully.\n\nThe patient's answers indicate social anxiety, particularly around interactions with strangers and stressful situations. They mentioned not enjoying parties but still finding joy in solitary hobbies. That points to social anxiety rather than general anhedonia. The depressed feelings are after specific events like the work meeting, which suggests they're reactive, not persistent. The irritability is in response to being pushed socially, which aligns with anxiety. Sleep issues are from worrying, not mania. \n\nThe user's instructions require a compassionate summary first. I need to acknowledge their struggles empathetically. Then, the diagnosis section. The main consideration is Social Anxiety Disorder, but maybe also an adjustment disorder. Since the depressive symptoms aren't pervasive, maybe not a major depression. The DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder include fear of social scrutiny, avoidance, and distress. The patient's avoidance of parties, snapping at friends, and work incidents fit that. Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood could also be possible since symptoms follow specific stressors. I should consider both and explain the reasoning.\n\nFor the reasoning part, I need to explain why Social Anxiety Disorder is the primary diagnosis, noting the triggers and functional impact. Mention the episodic depressive symptoms as stress-related, not meeting full MDD criteria. The insomnia and irritability tie to anxiety, not mood disorders. \n\nNext steps should include therapy options like CBT for social anxiety, maybe SSRIs if needed, and monitoring for worsening. Also, ruling out other disorders. I have to make sure all terms are properly tagged and follow the structure exactly. Let me check the required sections again: compassionate summary, diagnosis, reasoning, next steps. Tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. Need to avoid any markdown beyond the specified tags. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been experiencing significant stress and discomfort in social situations, leading to avoidance of interactions that feel overwhelming or anxiety-provoking. Your <sym>irritability</sym> when pressured to engage socially, alongside the <sym>low mood</sym> after negative social experiences, reflects a pattern of emotional reactivity tied to interpersonal fears. Your efforts to cope by withdrawing or focusing on solitary activities show resilience, but it also highlights the toll this stress takes on your well-being.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> with <med>adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood</med> features.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s symptoms align most closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, given their:  \n1. **Avoidance of social interactions** (e.g., avoiding parties, fearing negative evaluation during meetings) and associated <sym>distress</sym>.  \n2. **Episodic <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>** triggered by social stressors, consistent with <med>adjustment disorder</med>, as symptoms are stress-contingent rather than persistent or pervasive.  \n3. No evidence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (symptoms are reactive, not chronic) or <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> (no hypomanic features like increased energy or goal-directed activity).  \n4. Avoidance and anxiety are central to their distress, with mood symptoms secondary to social stressors.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoidance), cognitive distortions (\u201cI\u2019ll embarrass myself\u201d), and social skills.  \n2. **Gradual Exposure Therapy:** Systematic exposure to low-risk social interactions to reduce anticipatory anxiety.  \n3. **Monitor for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>:** If symptoms broaden beyond social contexts, reassessment may be needed.  \n4. **SSRI Trial (e.g., sertraline) or short-term benzodiazepines for acute anxiety** (if functional impairment worsens).  \n5. **Collaborative goal-setting:** Work on balancing social engagement and self-care to prevent avoidance spirals.  \n\nThis approach acknowledges your immediate struggles while addressing underlying patterns that could escalate without support.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the patient's answers to each question. \n\nFirst question was about lack of interest or pleasure. The patient says they don't really have an issue except with social events where they have to interact with strangers. They mentioned they still enjoy hobbies alone. So maybe anhedonia is present but situational, specifically in social contexts.\n\nSecond question was about feeling down or hopeless. The patient feels low after bad social interactions, like the work meeting where they froze. But it's not constant, only when anticipating stress. That points to situational episodes of depressed mood linked to social anxiety or stress.\n\nThird question about irritability. They admit to being short with people when pressured to go out, like snapping at a friend. But not constant anger. This could be related to social anxiety or stress responses.\n\nFourth and fifth questions about sleep and increased activity. The patient denies those, saying they have trouble sleeping due to worrying about social plans, and they're more indecisive and avoidant. This suggests insomnia related to anxiety rather than mania/hypomania.\n\nLooking for patterns, the main themes are social anxiety leading to avoidance, situational depressive symptoms when facing stress, and some irritability when pressured. They don't have the classic anhedonia across all areas, only social. The sleep disturbance is tied to anxiety, not hyperactivity.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Social anxiety disorder is a big one here. The avoidance of social situations, anxiety around interactions, and the negative impact on mood. Also, there's some depressive symptoms but they're not pervasive\u2014more triggered by stress, so maybe adjustment disorder with anxious and depressive features. But need to check if the duration and severity meet criteria.\n\nRisk factors: The patient experiences stress-related mood dips and some social withdrawal. The snapping at others shows possible mild irritability but not severe. The main risk might be worsening social withdrawal leading to more depression, but no acute risks like suicidal thoughts mentioned here.\n\nWait, need to check if they mentioned anything about self-harm or suicidal ideation. In the answers given, they didn't. So no immediate risks, but ongoing stress could be a concern.\n\nClinical significance points: The key issues are social anxiety impacting their enjoyment, leading to avoidance, and episodic depressed mood post-stressful events. The irritability is context-specific. The sleep issues (insomnia from anxiety) are relevant. They don't meet full criteria for major depression since the symptoms aren't daily or pervasive. Maybe adjustment disorder or generalized anxiety with social phobia elements.\n\nI should structure the summary accordingly. The main symptoms are anhedonia in social contexts, stress-induced depressed mood, and mild irritability. Patterns show symptoms triggered by social stressors. Clinical significance areas would include social anxiety, adjustment issues, and possible anxiety disorder. Risk factors are manageable but ongoing stress could be a concern.\n\nNeed to ensure that the summary uses correct terminology and doesn't speculate beyond the given info. Avoid labeling unless clear. For example, social anxiety disorder is a strong candidate here. Also note the episodic nature of the depressive symptoms. The sleep disturbance is insomnia related to anxiety, not a manic feature. The avoidance behavior is key here.\n\nMake sure not to mention things not there, like suicidal thoughts. Keep it to what's presented. The key is linking symptoms to social anxiety and stress responses. The summary should list the main points under each of the five required sections. Clinical observations should tie all together, highlighting the social anxiety as a central issue with comorbid stress-related depressive symptoms.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Avoidance/Anhedonia:** Situational anhedonia in social interactions (e.g., reluctance to attend parties, interactions with strangers), though enjoyment of solitary hobbies persists.  \n- **Stress-Triggered Depressive Symptoms:** Episodic low mood linked to social anxiety (e.g., post-work meeting freeze-up) or anticipated stress, not pervasive or persistent.  \n- **Situational Irritability:** Mild reactive irritability in response to social pressure (e.g., snapping at others when urged to engage socially).  \n- **Insomnia:** Sleep disturbance due to social anxiety-related rumination (e.g., worrying about upcoming events), not hyperarousal.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms are **socially triggered**, with distress emerging in anticipation of or following social interactions.  \n- Reports a distinction between self-directed activities (tolerated/enjoyed) and interpersonal situations (avoided/aversive).  \n- Descriptions emphasize **behavioral and emotional reactions to stressors** rather than spontaneous mood dysregulation.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Core features include avoidance of social situations, fear of negative evaluation, and impaired functioning in interpersonal contexts.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood:** Symptoms emerge in response to identifiable stressors (e.g., social demands) but do not meet full criteria for major depression or generalized anxiety.  \n- **Avoidant/Psychosocial Stress-Induced Anhedonia:** Context-specific withdrawal from social engagement.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance of social activities may limit occupational or relational functioning (e.g., work meeting-related distress).  \n- **Emotional Reactivity:** Mild irritability when pressured, suggesting potential escalation in high-stress contexts.  \n- **No acute risks (e.g., suicidal ideation, psychosis, or self-harm) noted in responses.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient exhibits **social anxiety-driven avoidance** and **context-specific depressive symptoms** triggered by anticipated or actual social stressors. Key features include:  \n- **Situational anhedonia** in social interactions, with intact solitary interests.  \n- **Episodic dysphoria** following perceived social failures (e.g., work-related freeze-up), though not persistent.  \n- **Irritability in response to interpersonal pressure**, tied to social avoidance patterns.  \n- **Insomnia** driven by anticipatory anxiety, not hyperarousal or mania.  \n- No evidence of core mood disorder symptoms (e.g., pervasive anhedonia, diurnal mood variation, or psychomotor changes).  \n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Further evaluation of social anxiety disorder and adjustment-related distress.  \n- Exploration of coping strategies for social stressors and rumination.  \n- Rule out comorbid mood disorders via deeper inquiry into symptom persistence, severity, and functional impact.",

The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics.

The therapist provided clear reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For instance, the therapist noted the patient's avoidance of social interactions and episodic depressed mood and irritability triggered by social stressors. However, the justification could have been strengthened by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses, such as Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, and providing more detailed differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling low after a social interaction, the therapist responded with understanding.

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "It sounds like you\u2019ve been experiencing significant stress and discomfort in social situations, leading to avoidance of interactions that feel overwhelming or anxiety-provoking. Your <sym>irritability</sym> when pressured to engage socially, alongside the <sym>low mood</sym> after negative social experiences, reflects a pattern of emotional reactivity tied to interpersonal fears. Your efforts to cope by withdrawing or focusing on solitary activities show resilience, but it also highlights the toll this stress takes on your well-being.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> with <med>adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood</med> features.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s symptoms align most closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, given their:  \n1. **Avoidance of social interactions** (e.g., avoiding parties, fearing negative evaluation during meetings) and associated <sym>distress</sym>.  \n2. **Episodic <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>** triggered by social stressors, consistent with <med>adjustment disorder</med>, as symptoms are stress-contingent rather than persistent or pervasive.  \n3. No evidence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (symptoms are reactive, not chronic) or <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> (no hypomanic features like increased energy or goal-directed activity).  \n4. Avoidance and anxiety are central to their distress, with mood symptoms secondary to social stressors.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoidance), cognitive distortions (\u201cI\u2019ll embarrass myself\u201d), and social skills.  \n2. **Gradual Exposure Therapy:** Systematic exposure to low-risk social interactions to reduce anticipatory anxiety.  \n3. **Monitor for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>:** If symptoms broaden beyond social contexts, reassessment may be needed.  \n4. **SSRI Trial (e.g., sertraline) or short-term benzodiazepines for acute anxiety** (if functional impairment worsens).  \n5. **Collaborative goal-setting:** Work on balancing social engagement and self-care to prevent avoidance spirals.  \n\nThis approach acknowledges your immediate struggles while addressing underlying patterns that could escalate without support.",
