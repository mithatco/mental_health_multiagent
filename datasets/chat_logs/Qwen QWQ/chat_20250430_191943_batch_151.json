      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the user's responses again. The patient mentioned little interest in hobbies (anhedonia), feeling down and hopeless, irritability, trouble sleeping but with energy. They also talked about restlessness, starting more projects, and anxiety symptoms like panic when not getting what they needs. The compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts about getting what they needs could point to OCD. They mentioned using more something but corrected to staying up late, but maybe there's some substance use. They also drink 3-4 times a week and use tobacco. The existential and social issues like feeling detached and distant from others, and avoiding social situations. \n\nThe first paragraph needs to be compassionate, acknowledging their struggles. I need to make sure I use the tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. \n\nNow, for the diagnosis. The main symptoms: anhedonia, depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia with hyperarousal, compulsions, substance use. The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features seems to fit, but also the anxiety symptoms and compulsions. GAD is there, but the OCD traits are present too. The panic attacks and avoidance might add to an anxiety disorder. The substance use (alcohol) is a separate issue but could be a comorbidity. \n\nWait, but the mixed features: the energy and starting projects could be hypomanic, but maybe they're not in a manic episode. Maybe it's just part of the anxiety or depression. \n\nWait the patient mentioned \"using more\" but then corrected. Maybe that's a red flag for substance use disorder. The alcohol use is 3-4 times a week, which could be problematic. \n\nPutting it all together, possible diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress, GAD, and Substance Use Disorder (alcohol). Also OCD features. But need to see if they meet full criteria. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 criteria for MDD requires at least 5 symptoms, so anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbance (insomnia with hyperarousal), possibly fatigue, but the patient said they have energy when not sleeping. That's atypical. Maybe mixed features. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a mixed episode? Bipolar with mixed features? But the patient didn't mention euphoria. \n\nThe compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts (obsessive) could warrant a OCD diagnosis if they meet the criteria. The patient mentions \"driven behaviors\" when anxious, which is more OCD-like. \n\nThe self-harm ideation is present but low intent, so maybe not a major suicide risk but still important. \n\nThe key points to hit in the diagnosis: MDD with anxious features, GAD, OCD traits, and alcohol use disorder. \n\nWait the DSM-5 diagnosis for Somatic Symptom Disorder? No, they don't mention feeling their symptoms are unexplained. The aches are attributed to overwork. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress. Secondary: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possible OCD features. The substance use is a concern. \n\nNeed to structure it into the required sections. \n\nThe first paragraph must be a compassionate summary, using the tags. \n\nThe diagnosis line should combine the main diagnosis. Let me see: The patient has multiple depressive and anxiety symptoms, compulsions, and substance use. The main diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress. Then GAD and OCD Not Otherwise Specified. \n\nWait, OCD has specific criteria: obsessions and compulsions causing distress. The patient mentions urges and repetitive behaviors, so OCD could fit. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nDiagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and possible comorbid OC features. \n\nNext steps would include mood stabilizers, therapy, etc. \n\nWait, the user might prefer to list the disorders in the diagnosis section as separate. \n\nWait the instructions say \"diagnosis or clinical impression\". Maybe list primary and secondary. \n\nProceeding to format all parts correctly with the tags and structure. \n\n---\n\n**1.** I hear how overwhelmed you feel, with <sym>diminished pleasure in activities</sym>, <sym>panic when unmet needs arise</sym>, and the emotional toll of <sym>snap judgments toward loved ones</sym>. You're clearly struggling to navigate these experiences alone, and your honesty about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> highlights how much these challenges are affecting your life. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to address these patterns.  \n\n**2.**  \n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (pending further evaluation of pain perception).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>hypersomnia</sym> aligns with <med>MDD</med>. The persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> suggest <med>GAD</med> and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>. The <sym>back pain</sym> and <sym>memory lapses</sym> may indicate somatization or stress-related physical effects. The <sym>alcohol use (3\u20134 times weekly</sym> and occasional tobacco use warrant <med>Substance Use Disorder (SUD)</med> screening.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive evaluation** by a psychiatristrist to assess <med>MDD</med> severity and <med>OCD</med> features (e.g., Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale).  \n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>maladaptive coping</sym>, including <med>exposure therapy</med> for anxiety.  \n3. **Medication review**: Trial of an <med>SRI</med> for depression, possibly with a <med>benzodiazepine</med> for acute anxiety (short-term use.  \n4. **Substance use assessment**: Evaluate alchohol use frequency and cravings to rule out <med>SUD</med>.  \n5. **Mental health tracking**: Daily journaling of mood, substance use, and compulsive urges to identify triggers.  \n6. **Supportive therapy groups**: Social reconnection programs to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.  \n\nWait, but the user said not to include Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted. The patient attributes back pain to work, so maybe somatic is not right. \n\nWait in the answers: \"Unexplained aches... 'Not sure'\". The patient attributed the aches to overwork, so it's not meeting Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. So scratch that. \n\nAdjust the diagnosis to exclude that. \n\nRevised diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>SUD</med> (if criteria met). Rule out <med>OCD</med> or <med>Major Depressive Episode with mixed features</med> if energy is manic-like. \n\nAlso, the energy and increased activity (starting projects) could be part of MDD with mixed features (hypomanic symptoms). \n\nWait, the DSM-5 has a mixed features specifier for depression. \n\nHmm, the insomnia with high energy might be a mixed episode, but need to check criteria. \n\nAlternatively, the restlessness and hyperactivity might be due to anxiety. \n\nThe compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts align with OCD. \n\nSo the diagnosis should include MDD with anxious distress, GAD, possible OCD, and SUD. \n\n**Final diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OC D)</med> (needs further evaluation. <med>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)</med> screening indicated.  \n\nWait, but OCD requires significant time (1 hour/day) and distress. The patient mentions \"repetitive behaviors when anxious. Maybe OCD features are present but not full criteria. So maybe \"OC features.\" \n\nSo adjust to:  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>mixed features</med> (hypermotoric insomnia), <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and possible <med>SUD</med>.  \n\nWait but the DSM-5 has a \"mixed features\" specifier for depressive episodes with manic symptoms. The patient has insomnia with increased energy/activity. That might qualify as mixed features. \n\nAlso, the panic attacks when unable to secure needs (maybe linked to anxiety). \n\nPutting it all together, the main diagnosis is MDD with anxious distress and mixed features, GAD, and SUD. \n\nThe reasoning section needs to tie the symptoms to the diagnosis. \n\nRecommended steps: therapy, meds, substance eval, etc. \n\nOkay, now format it precisely per the instructions. \n\nAlso, ensure all required sections are there with correct formatting. \n\nSymptoms like \"intrusive thoughts\" and \"compulsive behaviors\" would be under OCD, but need to check if they meet criteria. The patient says \"unpleasant thoughts\" and behaviors driven by them. Maybe OCD is present. \n\nI think the primary diagnosis is M",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a lot of information from a patient's responses. I need to parse through each question and answer to identify key symptoms and patterns.\n\nStarting with Q2 about lack of interest or pleasure. The patient says they \"go through the motions\" with hobbies. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, which is common in depression. Then Q3 mentions feeling down or hopeless, which is another depressive symptom. But then Q4 talks about feeling more irritable, which could point to either depression or anxiety. \n\nQ5 asks about sleeping less but having energy. The patient mentions not sleeping but having energy and maybe using more substances. Wait, they said \"using more\" but then correct to staying up late. Hmm, could be substance use? Maybe they're using drugs to stay awake? Not sure, but the mention of \"using more\" might be a clue here.\n\nQ6 is about starting projects or risky behavior. The patient took on side jobs, which might indicate increased activity or possibly mania, but they also mention feeling restless. That could tie into anxiety or ADHD, but restless is more anxiety. \n\nQ7 and Q8 both point to anxiety: nervous, anxious, on edge, panic when can't get what they need. The panic specifically when unable to get what they need\u2014maybe linked to substance use? The mention earlier of \"using more\" might be substance-related. \n\nAvoiding crowds (Q9) and unexplained aches (Q10) could be somatic symptoms of anxiety or depression. The back pain might be psychosomatic. \n\nQ11: They don't feel their illnesses are taken seriously, but they don't bring it up much. \n\nQ12: Thoughts of self-harm. The patient says \"once or twice,\" but no intent. Still a significant point to note, even if low risk. \n\nQ13-Q14: No psychosis, so that's good. \n\nQ15: Memory issues, like forgetting where they parked. Could be cognitive symptoms of depression or anxiety, or maybe substance use affecting memory. \n\nQ16-Q17: Intrusive thoughts (obsessive) and repetitive behaviors. This points to possible OCD or anxiety-driven compulsions. They mention obsessive thoughts about getting what they need and repeating behaviors when anxious. \n\nQ18-Q19: Feeling detached and existential questions about identity. Dissociation or existential depression. \n\nQ20: Social withdrawal, distancing from friends and relationships. \n\nQ21-Q22: Alcohol use 3-4 times a week and occasional smoking. Substance use as a coping mechanism. \n\nPutting this together, the main symptoms are depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood), anxiety (nervousness, panic, avoidance), possible OCD traits (intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors), substance use (alcohol and maybe something else from Q5?), and some issues with self-harm ideation. The pattern shows a mix of depression, anxiety, possible substance use as a coping mechanism, and some OCD features. \n\nPotential clinical areas: Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, possible GAD with panic attacks, OCD, and substance use disorder. The risk factors include the self-harm thoughts (even if low intent), substance use, and possible exacerbation of symptoms. The compulsive behaviors and anxiety might be linked. The social withdrawal and memory issues are also important. \n\nNeed to make sure not to miss anything. The mention of \"using more\" in Q5 could be substance use, so alcohol plus maybe another substance? But the patient didn't clarify, so maybe just the alcohol use is noted. \n\nAlso, the irritability and restlessness could be part of an anxiety disorder or a mixed depressive-anxiety state. The existential questions and feeling detached are part of the depressive symptoms. \n\nOkay, structuring the points as per the user's request: symptoms, patterns, areas of significance, risk factors, then clinical summary. Need to use proper terminology like cross-cutting symptoms, avoid speculation, stick to what's reported. \n\nWait, the patient mentioned \"using more\" in Q5. The exact quote is: \"I can't sleep, but still have a lot of energy. Wait, I mean, just staying up late.\" Maybe \"using more\" refers to substances, but they corrected to staying up late. So maybe they were referring to substance use but downplayed it. That's a possible risk factor for substance abuse. The alcohol use 3-4 times a week is concerning. \n\nSo in the potential areas, substance use disorder is definitely there. The compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts point to OCD. The self-harm thoughts are a risk, even if low intent. \n\nPatterns: There's a pattern of using substances (alcohol, maybe others) and compulsive behaviors as coping mechanisms. The coexistence of depressive and anxious symptoms suggests a possible comorbid condition. The social withdrawal and relationship issues indicate social functioning impairment. \n\nI need to ensure that all points from the answers are covered without adding things not mentioned. For example, the existential issues (Q19) and relationship problems (Q20) are important for diagnosis. \n\nRisk factors include the alcohol use, possible substance use disorder, and the self-harm thoughts. The panic attacks in specific situations (Q8) are a specific anxiety symptom. \n\nAlright, structuring the response now. Make sure each section (symptoms, patterns, areas, risks) are clear. Avoid any assumptions not directly stated. For example, the \"using more\" might be substance use, so it should be noted as possible substance use, but since they corrected themselves, maybe just the alcohol. But the initial \"using more\" could imply other substances. Hmm, tricky. The user said to focus on the responses given. The patient clarified to staying up late, so perhaps the \"using more\" was a slip, but the answer includes both. Maybe note the possible substance use as part of the risk factors. \n\nWait, in Q5: \"A5: Oh, sometimes. Like, some nights I can't sleep, but still have a lot of energy? I mean, just staying up late.\" Wait, the original answer says \"Wait, I mean, just staying up late.\" So maybe they initially said \"using more\" but corrected to staying up. Maybe it's a typo or mistake. But the user provided the exact responses, so I have to take it as is. So the patient mentioned \"using more\" but corrected. Maybe substance use is possible here, but unclear. Since it's unclear, maybe just note the sleep disturbance and possible substance use as a possibility, but the alcohol use is clear. \n\nOkay, proceed with that. The summary should include all these points. \n\nWait, the compulsive behaviors and repetitive actions (Q16-17) are definitely OCD features. The panic when unable to get what they need (Q8) could be related to substance use (like craving?) but maybe anxiety in general. \n\nNow, putting it all together in the required format. \n\nMake sure to use clinical terms like anhedonia, irritability, insomnia, hyperactivity, anxiety, panic, dissociation, substance use, etc. \n\nAlso, the self-harm ideation (Q12) needs to be highlighted as a risk, even if low intent. \n\nOkay, I think that's all. Let me structure each section step by step.\n</think>\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- Anhedonia (diminished interest/pleasure in activities).  \n- Depressed mood and hopelessness.  \n- Irritability and anger outbursts, particularly under stress.  \n- Insomnia with preserved/restless energy.  \n- Restlessness, increased psychomotor activity (taking on excessive projects).  \n- Marked anxiety (tension, physical symptoms like chest tightness.  \n- Panic attacks triggered by inability to secure needs (possibly linked to underlying stressors.  \n- Avoidant behavior (e.g., avoiding crowds.  \n- Intrusive, obsessive thoughts (e.g., about securing needs.  \n- Compensatory repetitive behaviors (ritualistic actions when anxious.  \n- Social withdrawal and relationship strain.  \n- Social alcohol use (3\u20134x/week) and occasional tobacco use.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Mixed affective symptoms:** Co-occurring depressive (anhedonia, hopelessness) and manic-like features (increased activity, insomnia with high energy.  \n- **Anxiety and compulsion:** Persistent anxiety, avoidance, and OCD-like symptoms (intrusive thoughts, repetitive behaviors.  \n- **Substance use as compensatory coping:** Alcohol use may be linked to self-medication.  \n- **Ambivalence:** Frequent hedging (\"sometimes,\" \"I guess,\" \"maybe\"), suggesting distress tolerance challenges and possible underreporting.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of anhedonia, depressed mood, and functional impairment (work-related fatigue.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder:** Anxiety, panic attacks, and somatic symptoms (chest tightness.  \n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (rituals to neutralize anxiety.  \n- **Substance Use Disorder:** Alcohol use frequency raises concern for maladaptive coping.  \n- **Mixed Episode Features:** Elevated energy and activity without clear euphoria could suggest a depressive mixed features specifier.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Self-harm ideation:** Acknowledgment of fleeting suicidal thoughts (Q12), though no intent.  \n- **Substance misuse:** Alcohol use \u22653x/week may indicate dependence or escalation risk.  \n- **Psychomotor agitation:** Increased energy without restorative sleep raises risk of exacerbation",

  "diagnosis": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the user's responses again. The patient mentioned little interest in hobbies (anhedonia), feeling down and hopeless, irritability, trouble sleeping but with energy. They also talked about restlessness, starting more projects, and anxiety symptoms like panic when not getting what they needs. The compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts about getting what they needs could point to OCD. They mentioned using more something but corrected to staying up late, but maybe there's some substance use. They also drink 3-4 times a week and use tobacco. The existential and social issues like feeling detached and distant from others, and avoiding social situations. \n\nThe first paragraph needs to be compassionate, acknowledging their struggles. I need to make sure I use the tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. \n\nNow, for the diagnosis. The main symptoms: anhedonia, depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia with hyperarousal, compulsions, substance use. The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features seems to fit, but also the anxiety symptoms and compulsions. GAD is there, but the OCD traits are present too. The panic attacks and avoidance might add to an anxiety disorder. The substance use (alcohol) is a separate issue but could be a comorbidity. \n\nWait, but the mixed features: the energy and starting projects could be hypomanic, but maybe they're not in a manic episode. Maybe it's just part of the anxiety or depression. \n\nWait the patient mentioned \"using more\" but then corrected. Maybe that's a red flag for substance use disorder. The alcohol use is 3-4 times a week, which could be problematic. \n\nPutting it all together, possible diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress, GAD, and Substance Use Disorder (alcohol). Also OCD features. But need to see if they meet full criteria. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 criteria for MDD requires at least 5 symptoms, so anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbance (insomnia with hyperarousal), possibly fatigue, but the patient said they have energy when not sleeping. That's atypical. Maybe mixed features. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a mixed episode? Bipolar with mixed features? But the patient didn't mention euphoria. \n\nThe compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts (obsessive) could warrant a OCD diagnosis if they meet the criteria. The patient mentions \"driven behaviors\" when anxious, which is more OCD-like. \n\nThe self-harm ideation is present but low intent, so maybe not a major suicide risk but still important. \n\nThe key points to hit in the diagnosis: MDD with anxious features, GAD, OCD traits, and alcohol use disorder. \n\nWait the DSM-5 diagnosis for Somatic Symptom Disorder? No, they don't mention feeling their symptoms are unexplained. The aches are attributed to overwork. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress. Secondary: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possible OCD features. The substance use is a concern. \n\nNeed to structure it into the required sections. \n\nThe first paragraph must be a compassionate summary, using the tags. \n\nThe diagnosis line should combine the main diagnosis. Let me see: The patient has multiple depressive and anxiety symptoms, compulsions, and substance use. The main diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress. Then GAD and OCD Not Otherwise Specified. \n\nWait, OCD has specific criteria: obsessions and compulsions causing distress. The patient mentions urges and repetitive behaviors, so OCD could fit. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nDiagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and possible comorbid OC features. \n\nNext steps would include mood stabilizers, therapy, etc. \n\nWait, the user might prefer to list the disorders in the diagnosis section as separate. \n\nWait the instructions say \"diagnosis or clinical impression\". Maybe list primary and secondary. \n\nProceeding to format all parts correctly with the tags and structure. \n\n---\n\n**1.** I hear how overwhelmed you feel, with <sym>diminished pleasure in activities</sym>, <sym>panic when unmet needs arise</sym>, and the emotional toll of <sym>snap judgments toward loved ones</sym>. You're clearly struggling to navigate these experiences alone, and your honesty about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> highlights how much these challenges are affecting your life.

The persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> suggest <med>GAD</med> and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>. The <sym>back pain</sym> and <sym>memory lapses</sym> may indicate somatization or stress-related physical effects. The <sym>alcohol use (3\u20134 times weekly</sym> and occasional tobacco use warrant <med>Substance Use Disorder (SUD)</med> screening.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive evaluation** by a psychiatristrist to assess <med>MDD</med> severity and <med>OCD</med> features (e.g., Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale).  \n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>maladaptive coping</sym>, including <med>exposure therapy</med> for anxiety.  \n3. **Medication review**: Trial of an <med>SRI</med> for depression, possibly with a <med>benzodiazepine</med> for acute anxiety (short-term use.  \n4. **Substance use assessment**: Evaluate alchohol use frequency and cravings to rule out <med>SUD</med>.  \n5. **Mental health tracking**: Daily journaling of mood, substance use, and compulsive urges to identify triggers.  \n6. **Supportive therapy groups**: Social reconnection programs to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.  \n\nWait, but the user said not to include Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted. The patient attributes back pain to work, so maybe somatic is not right. \n\nWait in the answers: \"Unexplained aches... 'Not sure'\". The patient attributed the aches to overwork, so it's not meeting Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. So scratch that. \n\nAdjust the diagnosis to exclude that. \n\nRevised diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>SUD</med> (if criteria met). Rule out <med>OCD</med> or <med>Major Depressive Episode with mixed features</med> if energy is manic-like. \n\nAlso, the energy and increased activity (starting projects) could be part of MDD with mixed features (hypomanic symptoms). \n\nWait, the DSM-5 has a mixed features specifier for depression. \n\nHmm, the insomnia with high energy might be a mixed episode, but need to check criteria. \n\nAlternatively, the restlessness and hyperactivity might be due to anxiety. \n\nThe compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts align with OCD. \n\nSo the diagnosis should include MDD with anxious distress, GAD, possible OCD, and SUD. \n\n**Final diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OC D)</med> (needs further evaluation. <med>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)</med> screening indicated.  \n\nWait, but OCD requires significant time (1 hour/day) and distress. The patient mentions \"repetitive behaviors when anxious. Maybe OCD features are present but not full criteria. So maybe \"OC features.\" \n\nSo adjust to:  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>mixed features</med> (hypermotoric insomnia), <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and possible <med>SUD</med>.  \n\nWait but the DSM-5 has a \"mixed features\" specifier for depressive episodes with manic symptoms. The patient has insomnia with increased energy/activity. That might qualify as mixed features. \n\nAlso, the panic attacks when unable to secure needs (maybe linked to anxiety). \n\nPutting it all together, the main diagnosis is MDD with anxious distress and mixed features, GAD, and SUD. \n\nThe reasoning section needs to tie the symptoms to the diagnosis. \n\nRecommended steps: therapy, meds, substance eval, etc. \n\nOkay, now format it precisely per the instructions. \n\nAlso, ensure all required sections are there with correct formatting. \n\nSymptoms like \"intrusive thoughts\" and \"compulsive behaviors\" would be under OCD, but need to check if they meet criteria. The patient says \"unpleasant thoughts\" and behaviors driven by them. Maybe OCD is present. \n\nI think the primary diagnosis is M",

That might qualify as mixed features. \n\nAlso, the panic attacks when unable to secure needs (maybe linked to anxiety). \n\nPutting it all together, the main diagnosis is MDD with anxious distress and mixed features, GAD, and SUD. \n\nThe reasoning section needs to tie the symptoms to the diagnosis. \n\nRecommended steps: therapy, meds, substance eval, etc. \n\nOkay, now format it precisely per the instructions. \n\nAlso, ensure all required sections are there with correct formatting. \n\nSymptoms like \"intrusive thoughts\" and \"compulsive behaviors\" would be under OCD, but need to check if they meet criteria. The patient says \"unpleasant thoughts\" and behaviors driven by them. Maybe OCD is present. \n\nI think the primary diagnosis is M",
