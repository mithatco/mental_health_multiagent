      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's start by reviewing the user's responses. The patient is clearly struggling with significant anxiety and avoidance behaviors. They mentioned feeling nervous, having panic attacks in social situations, and avoiding events like meetings and parties. The anhedonia and low energy suggest some depressive features, but not enough for a full depression diagnosis yet. Their sleep issues and irritability are also notable.\n\nThe key here is to identify the primary disorder. The panic attacks with avoidance point towards panic disorder with agoraphobia, but the social triggers (like public speaking) suggest social anxiety disorder. Since the panic occurs in social/performance contexts, social anxiety might be the main driver. The DSM-5 criteria for social anxiety disorder include fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and significant distress, which all fit. The subthreshold depressive symptoms need monitoring but don't meet full criteria yet. \n\nI should avoid jumping to a somatic symptom disorder since the symptoms align more with anxiety. The avoidance behaviors might progress if untreated, so early intervention is key. Cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting social anxiety and panic management would be a good start, along with possible SSRIs. They also need a thorough clinical interview to confirm diagnostic criteria and rule out other disorders like GAD or adjustment disorder. Referral to a specialist is important to ensure accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment. \n</think>\n\n<sym>Feeling nervous, panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> are central to your experience. It sounds like these reactions have been gradually limiting your life, and the constant tension must be exhausting to manage.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the patient's answers to the first nine questions of the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. I need to analyze these to identify symptoms and other clinical aspects.\n\nStarting with Q2 about little interest or pleasure\u2014A2 says they still go to work and see friends but not like before, so decreased interest/pleasure, which is anhedonia, a depressive symptom. But they're still functioning to some extent, so maybe mild. \n\nQ3 is about feeling down or hopeless. The patient says \"sometimes\" and mentions not feeling hopeless, which is a bit conflicting. They feel low but not hopeless, so maybe depressive mood but not severe. \n\nQ4: Anger? They report being more irritable, especially when nervous. That's irritability, which can be part of depression or anxiety. \n\nSleep: Q5 asks about sleeping less with high energy, but the patient says they have insomnia but no energy, so insomnia plus fatigue. That's common in depression. \n\nQ6: Starting more projects or risky behavior? The patient says no, avoiding instead. So not manic/hypomanic, more like anhedonia or low motivation. \n\nAnxiety symptoms start at Q7: feeling nervous, anxious, on edge (Q7: yes, with physical sensations like chest buzz), panic (Q8: panic with heart racing, dizziness leading to avoidance), and avoidance of anxiety-inducing situations (Q9: definitely avoiding, skipping events). \n\nSo the main symptoms are anxiety (generalized, panic), some depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood, fatigue, but not clear on hopelessness), and avoidance behaviors. The pattern shows high anxiety leading to significant avoidance, which could be social anxiety or panic disorder with avoidance. \n\nLooking for patterns: The patient's anxiety leads to avoidance, which is a key point. They mention canceling plans, avoiding meetings, which might be social anxiety or agoraphobia. The panic attacks (like heart racing, dizziness) in situations like public speaking. \n\nPotential clinical areas: Anxiety disorder, possibly panic disorder with agoraphobia, or social anxiety. Depressive symptoms present but maybe not meeting full criteria yet. \n\nRisk factors: The avoidance is increasing, which could lead to social withdrawal or worsening anxiety. They mentioned being \"nervous\" leading to irritability, which might indicate chronic stress or anxiety. The nervousness before meetings and canceling plans suggests significant impairment in social functioning. \n\nNeed to check if they have any suicidal thoughts, but the user hasn't provided that yet. Also, the nervous edge and panic attacks are key here. The patient's main concerns seem to revolve around anxiety and its impact on their life.\n\nWait, in Q3, they aren't hopeless, which is a good sign for depression. The anhedonia isn't complete. So maybe more of a subthreshold depression or adjustment disorder with anxiety. \n\nThe main concerns are anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance, and some depressive symptoms. The clinical significance here is the level of avoidance, which is impairing their social life. \n\nRisk factors: The fact that avoidance is worsening could mean increased social isolation, which can exacerbate mental health issues. They don't mention self-harm, but their avoidance might be a coping mechanism. \n\nSo, putting this all together in the required sections. Need to make sure not to speculate beyond what's given. \n\nWait, also note that they still go to work, so occupational functioning is maintained, but social is impaired. The irritability when nervous is a possible link between anxiety and mood. \n\nAlright, structuring the answer as per the instructions. Main symptoms: anhedonia, anxiety, panic, avoidance, irritability, insomnia with fatigue. \n\nPatterns: Anxiety symptoms cluster around social/situational triggers (meetings, parties), leading to avoidance. The responses about avoidance are consistent across several questions (Q7-9). \n\nPotential areas: Major Depressive Disorder (subthreshold?), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder with or without agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder. \n\nRisk factors: Increasing avoidance could lead to social withdrawal, possible functional impairment. The irritability might indicate stress or underlying anxiety. \n\nNeed to highlight these points in clinical terms without assuming diagnosis. Also, note the lack of suicidal ideation (since they didn't mention it, but maybe it's not part of the questions yet). \n\nOkay, time to format the answer according to the numbered points.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n   - **Anxiety-related symptoms**: Persistent nervousness, feeling \"on edge,\" panic attacks (physiological symptoms like heart racing, dizziness in specific situations, e.g., public speaking).  \n   - **Avoidance behavior**: Systematic avoidance of social gatherings, work meetings, and planned activities to reduce anxiety, worsening over time.  \n   - **Subthreshold depressive symptoms**: Mild anhedonia (reduced interest/pleasure in activities), low energy/fatigue, and low mood without overt hopelessness or suicidal ideation.  \n   - **Irritability**: Increased reactivity in response to stressors, particularly when feeling nervous.  \n   - **Insomnia**: Difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep without energy compensation (e.g., fatigue dominates).  \n\n2. **Patterns in Responses**  \n   - Symptoms cluster around **situational and social anxiety triggers** (e.g., public speaking, social gatherings).  \n   - Avoidance behaviors are **functional adaptations** to anxiety, leading to gradual social withdrawal.  \n   - Self-awareness of symptom impact (\"it's gotten worse lately\") suggests insight into declining functioning.  \n\n3. **Potential Clinical Significance**  \n   - **Anxiety Disorders**: Likely primary presentation of **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** or **Social Anxiety Disorder**, with panic attacks and avoidant behaviors.  \n   - **Depressive Features**: Subsyndromal depression (anhedonia, low energy) may co-occur, warranting further exploration.  \n   - **Somatic Symptoms**: Physiological arousal (e.g., chest tightness, dizziness during panic episodes) aligns with anxiety disorders.  \n\n4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n   - **Progressive avoidance** impairing social/occupational functioning.  \n   - **Secondary functional decline**: Self-reported diminished interest in activities and social isolation.  \n   - **Irritability** may strain interpersonal relationships or coping capacity.  \n   - No acute self-harm/risk of harm reported.  \n\n5. **Summary (Clinical Language)**  \n   The patient presents with **moderate to severe anxiety symptoms**, including generalized nervousness, panic attacks (triggered by social/performance situations), and significant avoidance behavior, consistent with potential **Social Anxiety Disorder** or **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic features**. Subsyndromal depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low energy) and sleep disturbance suggest possible concurrent **moderate depression** or adjustment disorder. Functional impairment is notable in social domains, driven by avoidance and anxiety. Further assessment is needed to evaluate diagnostic thresholds for mood, anxiety, and comorbid conditions.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Feeling nervous, panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> are central to your experience. It sounds like these reactions have been gradually limiting your life, and the constant tension must be exhausting to manage. Your efforts to push through\u2014like going to work while dreading social interactions\u2014highlight both resilience and the significant toll this is taking.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional) with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behavior</sym>; <med>Depressive symptoms</med> (subsyndromal)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n1. <sym>Panic attacks</sym> (heart racing, dizziness in specific situations) and marked <sym>avoidance of feared social/performance contexts</sym> align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> criteria, which include fear of scrutiny and avoidance causing clinically significant distress.  \n2. <sym>Subsyndromal depressive symptoms</sym> (anhedonia, low energy) meet some <med>MDD</med> criteria but lack full severity/duration required for a diagnosis.  \n3. <sym>Irritability</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym> are common in anxiety disorders and may co-occur with stress.  \n4. Panic attacks appear situational (e.g., public speaking), distinguishing this from <med>Panic Disorder</med> without social triggers.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Therapy prioritization**:  \n   - Begin <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> focusing on exposure-based techniques for social anxiety and panic management.  \n2. **Medical Evaluation:**  \n   - Rule out medical causes for <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>somatic panic symptoms</sym> (e.g., thyroid function, cardiac workup if unexplained).  \n3. **Medication Review:**  \n   - Trial of a <med>SSRI</med> (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram) to address both anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n4. **Sleep Hygiene Interventions:**  \n   - Implement consistent sleep routines, limiting stimulants, and relaxation techniques to address <sym>insomnia</sym>.  \n5. **Collaborative Assessment:**  \n   - Full psychiatric evaluation to assess for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and rule out <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.  \n6. **Supportive Care:**  \n   - Mindfulness or stress-reduction practices to manage <sym>chronic nervousness</sym>.  \n\nA tailored approach addressing both anxiety and depressive symptoms, combined with behavioral interventions, could help reduce avoidance and improve daily functioning.",
