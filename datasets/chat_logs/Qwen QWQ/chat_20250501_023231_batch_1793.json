      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. The user provided a detailed set of answers to the DSM-5 questionnaire, and I need to structure the response as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to ensure I follow the exact structure: the compassionate summary, then Diagnosis, Reasoning, and Recommendations. Also, all the tags must be correctly applied. \n\nStarting with the compassionate summary. I need to paraphrase the patient's experience, using their quotes where possible. They mentioned feeling anxious, avoiding social events, and having physical symptoms dismissed. I should highlight their frustration and distress here.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section. The key symptoms are anxiety, somatic complaints, and possible OCD features. The DSM-5 says somatic symptom disorder requires excessive thoughts/behaviors related to symptoms plus ongoing symptoms. But also, GAD is a key fit with the anxiety, worry, and physical symptoms. The patient's excessive focus on physical pain and doctor's dismissal could align with somatic symptom disorder, but their primary distress seems anxiety-related. However, GAD is a solid fit here.\n\nWait, in the answers, the patient mentioned \"Constantly\" with the intrusive thoughts. The repetitive thoughts about locking doors (checking) and the obsessive worry. OCD is part of their presentation. So maybe a dual diagnosis? \n\nLooking at the DSM-5 criteria for GAD: excessive anxiety on most days, difficulty controlling worry, physical symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, etc.). The patient's symptoms align with GAD. The somatic symptoms (aches, digestive issues) might be better explained by anxiety rather than a separate somatic disorder unless the distress/behavior is disproportionate. The patient's report of \"The doctor said it's all in my head\" indicates possible somatic symptom disorder, but perhaps it's better categorized under GAD with associated somatic symptoms. \n\nThe panic symptoms (Q7/Q8) could be panic disorder, but they didn't report full panic attacks. The avoidance is more about anxiety sensitivity. \n\nAlso, the dissociative feelings (Q17: depersonalization when driving) might be transient and linked to anxiety, not PTSD or depersonalization-derealization disorder. \n\nThe OCD features (checking, intrusive thoughts) may meet subthreshold OCD or OCD spectrum. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis might be **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** with **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) spectrum features** and **Somatic Symptom Disorder** needs to be considered but might be better explained by GAD. Wait, according to the DSM-5, Somatic Symptom Disorder requires excessive thoughts/actions related to symptoms, and the patient's frustration over being dismissed could meet that. However, their primary presentation is anxiety-driven, so perhaps GAD is primary. \n\nWait, also, the patient said their doctor dismissed their physical symptoms. Somatic Symptom Disorder requires excessive thoughts/feelings about the symptoms (e.g., preoccupation, anxiety, and disproportionate behavior). The patient's statements about the doctor dismissing their symptoms (\"they said it's all in my head\") align with excessive worry about somatic symptoms, which might fulfill Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. However, GAD's somatic symptoms are also common. Need to see if the somatic symptoms are better explained by anxiety or if they meet Somatic Symptom Disorder's exclusive criteria. Since the patient's primary distress is anxiety, GAD is likely primary, with Somatic Symptom Disorder as a possible comorbidity if criteria are met. But let me check:\n\nSomatic Symptom Disorder requires:  \n- Somatic symptoms causing distress or impairment,  \n- Excessive thoughts (e.g., \"I can't stop worrying about my health\"),  \n- Excessive feelings of anxiety about symptoms, or  \n- Excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., frequent doctor visits, checking).  \n\nThe patient does mention excessive worrying about their health (Q10/Q11) and dissatisfaction with medical care, which might meet the Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. But the primary driver of their distress seems to be anxiety, so I need to decide which is primary. \n\nAlternatively, could this be a mixed presentation of GAD and Somatic Symptom Disorder? \n\nThe answer should list both if applicable. But let me check the DSM-5 guidelines. The manual emphasizes that somatic symptoms can co-occur with other anxiety disorders. So, perhaps both are applicable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should prioritize the strongest fit. GAD seems primary, with somatic symptoms as part of that. \n\nAlso, the patient's repetitive thoughts (Q15-16) about checking locks, \"what if\" scenarios: OCD spectrum. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The somatic symptoms may be part of GAD, but if they meet full criteria, Somatic Symptom Disorder could be a secondary diagnosis. The OCD features might be subthreshold OCD or part of GAD's worry. \n\nDiagnosis should be:  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**  \n- **OCD spectrum features (obsessive worries/ruminations, compulsive checking)**  \n- **Possibly comorbid Somatic Symptom Disorder** (needs further evaluation).  \n\nBut the instructions say to provide the diagnosis as per the data. The symptoms for GAD are clearly present. The somatic symptoms and health anxiety may meet Somatic Symptom Disorder if they meet the criteria for excessive thoughts/behaviors beyond what's expected. The patient's report of \"constant\" repetitive thoughts (Q16) and the impact of their symptoms on their life (can't enjoy hobbies, work issues) support this. \n\nHowever, to avoid overdiagnosing, maybe GAD with associated somatic symptoms is sufficient. The key here is to prioritize the most appropriate primary diagnosis. \n\nThe user's instructions said to consider all criteria. The DSM-5's Somatic Symptom Disorder requires that the somatic symptoms are not better explained by another disorder. Since anxiety (GAD) explains the physical symptoms, maybe Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't necessary unless the somatic focus is excessive beyond the anxiety. The patient's frustration with being dismissed could indicate health anxiety, which is part of GAD. \n\nAlternatively, the repetitive thoughts and checking might meet OCD. The DSM-5 lists GAD when the anxiety is about various topics, whereas OCD is about specific obsessions/compulsions. The \"checking locks\" might be a compulsion, and the obsessions about safety, health, etc. So a possible OCD diagnosis. But without clear compulsions, maybe it's subthreshold OCD. \n\nHmm, the instructions require to use DSM-5 criteria strictly. The patient's answers include:  \n- Excessive anxiety/worry (GAD).  \n- Somatic symptoms (GAD can include physical symptoms.  \n- Recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (checking locks), which could be compulsions. If the checking is done to reduce anxiety, then OCD is a consideration. However, if the checking is more avoidance, then it\u2019s part of GAD.  \n\nThe key here is to note all possible. The answer should include GAD as primary, possibly with obsessive features. The Somatic Symptom Disorder is possible but needs to be differentiated. \n\nThe instructions also emphasize not to default to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly. Since the primary concern seems anxiety, GAD is primary. The obsessive thoughts and checking might meet OCD. \n\nWait, the answer must follow the structure: Diagnosis section with the diagnosis. Let me see the DSM-5 criteria for GAD: excessive anxiety about various topics, difficulty controlling, physical symptoms. The patient's description fits GAD. The obsessions and checking could be part of GAD's anxiety or OCD. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's repetitive thoughts (Q15-16) about \"what ifs\" and checking locks might meet OCD's obsessions and compulsions. But is the compulsive checking a primary focus? They mentioned checking locks three times, which could be a compulsion. \n\nWait, in Q16, they said \"Repetitive thoughts that you can't get rid of?\" and answered \"Constantly\", and Q16's answer mentions checking locks. The DSM-5 OCD requires obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (rituals done to neutralize the obsessions. The checking of locks could be a compulsion if it\u2019s done to reduce anxiety about a feared outcome. The intrusive thoughts about harm, failure, etc., fit OCD. However, to confirm OCD, they need obsessions and compulsions. The patient's \"checking locks\" might be a compulsion, but is there an obsession driving it? The lock checking might be related to fear of consequences (intrusive thoughts about safety), leading to checking. That could meet OCD. \n\nAlternatively, if the preoccupation is with safety due to anxiety, it could be part of GAD. It's a bit of a gray area. The DSM-5 allows for comorbid diagnoses. \n\nThe question also mentions to avoid defaulting to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted. Since their primary issue is anxiety, that's the primary. \n\nPutting this together, the diagnosis would be:  \n\nDiagnosis: <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) spectrum features</med>, <med>Somatic symptom concerns</med>, and <med>Anxiety-induced dissociative episodes</med>. \n\nWait, the dissociative episodes (Q17) like zoning out while driving could be transient and due to hypervigilance or anxiety, not a separate disorder. \n\nAlternatively, the dissociation could be transient and linked to anxiety. \n\nSo the primary is GAD, with OCD features. Somatic symptoms might be part of GAD, but if they meet criteria, then Somatic",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's start by going through each of the patient's answers. The user provided a detailed set of responses to the DSM-5 Level 1 questions, and I need to analyze them step by step as per the instructions.\n\nFirst, the patient's main symptoms. Looking at Q2, they mention decreased interest in activities like hiking, but it's not every day. That's a possible depressive symptom but maybe moderate. Then Q3, they clarify that they're not feeling down or hopeless but have constant tension and worry. That seems more anxiety-related. The irritability in Q4 is significant, happening more than half the days. Sleep issues in Q14 and Q15 about memory problems. The anxiety symptoms are really prominent in Q7 and Q8, with panic-like symptoms and avoidance behaviors. The physical symptoms (Q10) like aches and pains, and the feeling that their concerns aren't taken seriously (Q11). Also, the repetitive thoughts and checking (Q16) point towards possible OCD or anxiety. The self-detachment in Q17 and existential uncertainty in Q18 might be signs of dissociation or existential distress.\n\nPatterns: The patient's responses often start with uncertainty (using a lot of \"Hmm\", \"Well\", \"Wait\"), indicating possible self-doubt or anxiety about their symptoms. They frequently compare their experiences to pre-illness states (\"but not like before\"). They also use phrases like \"I can't stop them\" which shows an inability to control thoughts or emotions.\n\nClinical significance areas: Anxiety, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with possible panic disorder features (from Q7 and Q8). The avoidance in Q9 and Q8's avoidance of situations points towards social anxiety or agoraphobia. The repetitive thoughts and checking in Q16 could be OCD. The depressive symptoms in Q2 and Q3 are mild but present. The somatic symptoms (Q10 and Q11) are significant and might indicate somatic symptom disorder. The dissociative symptoms in Q17 and existential concerns in Q18 could be part of an anxiety disorder or another disorder. Sleep disturbance and memory issues (Q14, Q15) are common in anxiety and depression.\n\nRisk factors: The patient mentioned thoughts of wanting to escape their brain (Q112), though they say no intent to self-harm, but those thoughts are still a risk. The social withdrawal and avoidance (Q9, Q8) could lead to isolation. The physical symptoms being dismissed by a doctor might lead to increased distress. They also mentioned work impairment (Q15), which is a functional impairment.\n\nI need to make sure I don't miss anything. The key points here are the anxiety symptoms (GAD, possible panic), somatic symptoms, OCD features, mild depressive symptoms, and social/avoidance behaviors. The risk factors include the self-reported suicidal ideation (non-suicidal but still concerning), and the functional impact on work and social life.\n\nWait, Q12 about hearing voices? They said no, so that's ruled out. The thoughts in Q16 are intrusive but not voices. The dissociation is transient. So, no psychotic features. The self-harm thoughts in Q11 are non-suicidal but still important to note.\n\nPutting this all together into the required sections. The summary should be concise in clinical terms, using DSM-5 terms where applicable.\n\nNeed to ensure not to include speculation. The main symptoms are anxiety, avoidance, somatic complaints, OCD features, mild depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and some dissociative moments. The risk factors include the suicidal ideation (non-suicidal but present), functional impairment, and possibly somatic symptom disorder. The patterns are the uncertainty in their answers, comparing to past self, and the intensity of the anxiety symptoms.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anxiety symptoms**: Persistent nervousness (Q7: daily), physical manifestations (tremors, palpitations), worry, and avoidance behaviors (Q8: situational avoidance).  \n- **Functional impairment**: Social withdrawal (skipped events), work performance issues (Q15/Q18).  \n- **Recurrent intrusive thoughts**: Obsessive \"what if\" ideation, compulsive checking (Q16).  \n- **Somatic symptoms**: Musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal distress linked to psychological stress (Q10/Q11).  \n- **Irritability and anger dysregulation** (Q4: frequent.  \n- **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia with racing thoughts (Q14.  \n\n**2. Response Patterns:**  \n- **Uncertainty and self-doubt**: Frequent hedging (\"maybe,\" \"I think,\" \"is that normal?\"), suggesting heightened self-monitoring of symptoms.  \n- **Comparisons to premorbid functioning**: Explicit references to diminished enjoyment of previously valued activities (Q2/Q3.  \n- **Somatization**: Attributing distress to physical symptoms, with externalized frustration toward medical dismissal (Q11.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Persistent worry, somatic symptoms, restlessness, and functional impairment (DSM-5 criteria met).  \n- **Panic-like symptoms**: Recurrent physical sensations of panic (Q7/Q8), though panic disorder criteria may require further evaluation.  \n- **OCD spectrum features**: Intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking (Q16.  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder**: Excessive focus on bodily symptoms with health anxiety (Q10/Q11.  \n- **Mixed anxiety-depression profile**: Mild anhedonia (Q2) with anxiety-driven symptoms (Q3.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Passive suicidal ideation**: Non-specific wish to \"escape\" (Q11, no intent/plans.  \n- **Social isolation**: Avoidance of social/occupational roles (Q8/Q18.  \n- **Secondary somatic preoccupation**: May exacerbate anxiety and mistrust of healthcare providers.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with prominent **generalized anxiety**, **avoidant behaviors**, and **cognitive dysregulation** (intrusive thoughts, concentration deficits). Key features include somatic symptoms driven by anxiety, irritability, and mild anhedonia. OCD-spectrum repetitive thought patterns and sleep disturbance suggest dysregulated arousal. While suicidal ideation is non-suicidal, persistent avoidance and social withdrawal indicate functional decline. Further assessment required for differential diagnosis (e.g., panic disorder, adjustment disorder with anxious mood, somatic symptom disorder), and evaluation of occupational/interpersonal impact. Consider prioritizing CBT for anxiety management, stress-reduction strategies, and collaboration with a primary care provider to address somatic concerns.",

Wait, according to the DSM-5, Somatic Symptom Disorder requires excessive thoughts/actions related to symptoms, and the patient's frustration over being dismissed could meet that. However, their primary presentation is anxiety-driven, so perhaps GAD is primary. \n\nWait, also, the patient said their doctor dismissed their physical symptoms. Somatic Symptom Disorder requires excessive thoughts/feelings about the symptoms (e.g., preoccupation, anxiety, and disproportionate behavior). The patient's statements about the doctor dismissing their symptoms (\"they said it's all in my head\") align with excessive worry about somatic symptoms, which might fulfill Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. However, GAD's somatic symptoms are also common. Need to see if the somatic symptoms are better explained by anxiety or if they meet Somatic Symptom Disorder's exclusive criteria. Since the patient's primary distress is anxiety, GAD is likely primary, with Somatic Symptom Disorder as a possible comorbidity if criteria are met. But let me check:\n\nSomatic Symptom Disorder requires:  \n- Somatic symptoms causing distress or impairment,  \n- Excessive thoughts (e.g., \"I can't stop worrying about my health\"),  \n- Excessive feelings of anxiety about symptoms, or  \n- Excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., frequent doctor visits, checking).  \n\nThe patient does mention excessive worrying about their health (Q10/Q11) and dissatisfaction with medical care, which might meet the Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria. But the primary driver of their distress seems to be anxiety, so I need to decide which is primary. \n\nAlternatively, could this be a mixed presentation of GAD and Somatic Symptom Disorder? \n\nThe answer should list both if applicable. But let me check the DSM-5 guidelines. The manual emphasizes that somatic symptoms can co-occur with other anxiety disorders. So, perhaps both are applicable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer should prioritize the strongest fit. GAD seems primary, with somatic symptoms as part of that. \n\nAlso, the patient's repetitive thoughts (Q15-16) about checking locks, \"what if\" scenarios: OCD spectrum. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The somatic symptoms may be part of GAD, but if they meet full criteria, Somatic Symptom Disorder could be a secondary diagnosis. The OCD features might be subthreshold OCD or part of GAD's worry. \n\nDiagnosis should be:  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**  \n- **OCD spectrum features (obsessive worries/ruminations, compulsive checking)**  \n- **Possibly comorbid Somatic Symptom Disorder** (needs further evaluation).  \n\nBut the instructions say to provide the diagnosis as per the data. The symptoms for GAD are clearly present. The somatic symptoms and health anxiety may meet Somatic Symptom Disorder if they meet the criteria for excessive thoughts/behaviors beyond what's expected. The patient's report of \"constant\" repetitive thoughts (Q16) and the impact of their symptoms on their life (can't enjoy hobbies, work issues) support this. \n\nHowever, to avoid overdiagnosing, maybe GAD with associated somatic symptoms is sufficient. The key here is to prioritize the most appropriate primary diagnosis. \n\nThe user's instructions said to consider all criteria. The DSM-5's Somatic Symptom Disorder requires that the somatic symptoms are not better explained by another disorder. Since anxiety (GAD) explains the physical symptoms, maybe Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't necessary unless the somatic focus is excessive beyond the anxiety. The patient's frustration with being dismissed could indicate health anxiety, which is part of GAD. \n\nAlternatively, the repetitive thoughts and checking might meet OCD. The DSM-5 lists GAD when the anxiety is about various topics, whereas OCD is about specific obsessions/compulsions. The \"checking locks\" might be a compulsion, and the obsessions about safety, health, etc. So a possible OCD diagnosis. But without clear compulsions, maybe it's subthreshold OCD. \n\nHmm, the instructions require to use DSM-5 criteria strictly. The patient's answers include:  \n- Excessive anxiety/worry (GAD).  \n- Somatic symptoms (GAD can include physical symptoms.  \n- Recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (checking locks), which could be compulsions. If the checking is done to reduce anxiety, then OCD is a consideration. However, if the checking is more avoidance, then it\u2019s part of GAD.  \n\nThe key here is to note all possible. The answer should include GAD as primary, possibly with obsessive features. The Somatic Symptom Disorder is possible but needs to be differentiated. \n\nThe instructions also emphasize not to default to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly. Since the primary concern seems anxiety, GAD is primary. The obsessive thoughts and checking might meet OCD. \n\nWait, the answer must follow the structure: Diagnosis section with the diagnosis. Let me see the DSM-5 criteria for GAD: excessive anxiety about various topics, difficulty controlling, physical symptoms. The patient's description fits GAD. The obsessions and checking could be part of GAD's anxiety or OCD. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's repetitive thoughts (Q15-16) about \"what ifs\" and checking locks might meet OCD's obsessions and compulsions. But is the compulsive checking a primary focus? They mentioned checking locks three times, which could be a compulsion. \n\nWait, in Q16, they said \"Repetitive thoughts that you can't get rid of?\" and answered \"Constantly\", and Q16's answer mentions checking locks. The DSM-5 OCD requires obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (rituals done to neutralize the obsessions. The checking of locks could be a compulsion if it\u2019s done to reduce anxiety about a feared outcome. The intrusive thoughts about harm, failure, etc., fit OCD. However, to confirm OCD, they need obsessions and compulsions. The patient's \"checking locks\" might be a compulsion, but is there an obsession driving it? The lock checking might be related to fear of consequences (intrusive thoughts about safety), leading to checking. That could meet OCD. \n\nAlternatively, if the preoccupation is with safety due to anxiety, it could be part of GAD. It's a bit of a gray area. The DSM-5 allows for comorbid diagnoses. \n\nThe question also mentions to avoid defaulting to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted. Since their primary issue is anxiety, that's the primary. \n\nPutting this together, the diagnosis would be:  \n\nDiagnosis: <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) spectrum features</med>, <med>Somatic symptom concerns</med>, and <med>Anxiety-induced dissociative episodes</med>. \n\nWait, the dissociative episodes (Q17) like zoning out while driving could be transient and due to hypervigilance or anxiety, not a separate disorder. \n\nAlternatively, the dissociation could be transient and linked to anxiety. \n\nSo the primary is GAD, with OCD features. Somatic symptoms might be part of GAD, but if they meet criteria, then Somatic",

Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anxiety, anger, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, memory, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, identity and relationships, and somatic concerns.

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual but still have a lot of energy,' the patient responded that they couldn't sleep well and were always tired, which might not directly align with the DSM-5 criteria for hypomania. However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist adjusted the conversation based on the patient's disclosures and didn't abruptly change topics. The questions built smoothly on previous answers, creating a coherent conversational arc.",

However, minor ambiguity exists in justifying the extent to which Somatic Symptom Disorder is warranted.",

The user provided a detailed set of answers to the DSM-5 questionnaire, and I need to structure the response as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to ensure I follow the exact structure: the compassionate summary, then Diagnosis, Reasoning, and Recommendations. Also, all the tags must be correctly applied. \n\nStarting with the compassionate summary. I need to paraphrase the patient's experience, using their quotes where possible. They mentioned feeling anxious, avoiding social events, and having physical symptoms dismissed. I should highlight their frustration and distress here.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section. The key symptoms are anxiety, somatic complaints, and possible OCD features. The DSM-5 says somatic symptom disorder requires excessive thoughts/behaviors related to symptoms plus ongoing symptoms. But also, GAD is a key fit with the anxiety, worry, and physical symptoms. The patient's excessive focus on physical pain and doctor's dismissal could align with somatic symptom disorder, but their primary distress seems anxiety-related. However, GAD is a solid fit here.\n\nWait, in the answers, the patient mentioned \"Constantly\" with the intrusive thoughts. The repetitive thoughts about locking doors (checking) and the obsessive worry. OCD is part of their presentation. So maybe a dual diagnosis? \n\nLooking at the DSM-5 criteria for GAD: excessive anxiety on most days, difficulty controlling worry, physical symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, etc.). The patient's symptoms align with GAD. The somatic symptoms (aches, digestive issues) might be better explained by anxiety rather than a separate somatic disorder unless the distress/behavior is disproportionate. The patient's report of \"The doctor said it's all in my head\" indicates possible somatic symptom disorder, but perhaps it's better categorized under GAD with associated somatic symptoms. \n\nThe panic symptoms (Q7/Q8) could be panic disorder, but they didn't report full panic attacks. The avoidance is more about anxiety sensitivity. \n\nAlso, the dissociative feelings (Q17: depersonalization when driving) might be transient and linked to anxiety, not PTSD or depersonalization-derealization disorder. \n\nThe OCD features (checking, intrusive thoughts) may meet subthreshold OCD or OCD spectrum. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis might be **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** with **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) spectrum features** and **Somatic Symptom Disorder** needs to be considered but might be better explained by GAD. Wait, according to the DSM-5, Somatic Symptom Disorder requires excessive thoughts/actions related to symptoms, and the patient's frustration over being dismissed could meet that.
