      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a detailed questionnaire from a patient and wants a clinical assessment based on DSM-5 criteria. The instructions are strict, so I need to follow the structure exactly.\n\nFirst, I need to start with a compassionate summary. The patient's answers mention divorce, loss of interest, irritability, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. I should acknowledge their distress empathetically.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The main symptoms are depressive (anhedonia, low mood), anxiety (nervousness, panic), and somatic issues. The divorce is a clear stressor, so adjustment disorder is possible. But the duration (over two weeks) and severity might meet MDD. However, the stressor's timing suggests adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance might be primary. Need to check criteria for adjustment disorder: symptoms within 3 months of stressor, emotional distress out of proportion to the event, and impaired functioning. The patient's symptoms fit that.\n\nDSM-5 criteria for adjustment disorder require evidence of stressor and functional impairment. MDD needs 2 weeks of symptoms without a clear stressor, but here the divorce is recent. Also, the patient's somatic symptoms (headaches, etc.) might be due to anxiety or adjustment, not Somatic Symptom Disorder, since they don't meet the excessive health anxiety criteria from their answers. \n\nThe recommended next steps should include a clinical interview for full DSM criteria, safety assessment for suicidal thoughts, and possible referral for therapy. Medication might be needed if depression is severe. \n\nI must avoid mentioning Somatic Symptom Disorder unless it's clear, which it's not here. The key is adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance because the stressor is directly linked. Also, need to mention GAD and possible MDD as co-occurring.\n\nNow structure each section with required tags and format. Check all points in the user's answers to ensure nothing's missed. Make sure to use the exact headings and tags. Don't forget to list the steps as numbered points. \n\nDouble-check that the diagnosis aligns with DSM-5 and the patient's answers. Avoid any markdown except for the specified tags. Keep the tone professional yet empathetic. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Loss of pleasure</sym> in activities, persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> paint a picture of profound emotional turmoil since your divorce.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire. Let's start by going through each question and their answers to identify key symptoms and patterns.\n\nFirst, the patient mentioned a lack of interest in activities they previously enjoyed (Q2) since their divorce. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, which is common in depression. They also report feeling down and hopeless (Q3), which aligns with depressive symptoms. The irritability (Q4) is noted, which can be part of depression too, especially in adults. Their sleep disturbances (Q14) with insomnia and hypersomnia are also indicative of depressive episodes. \n\nLooking at anxiety symptoms, they mentioned feeling anxious and on edge (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8), which point to generalized anxiety or panic disorder. The physical symptoms like headaches and stomach issues (Q9) might be somatic manifestations of their anxiety or depression. \n\nThe patient also experiences intrusive thoughts about past arguments (Q16) and feels detached (Q18), which could suggest elements of PTSD or an adjustment disorder related to their divorce. However, they don't mention specific trauma triggers, so maybe it's more adjustment-related. The lack of psychosis (Q12, Q13) rules out schizophrenia spectrum disorders. \n\nSocial withdrawal (Q20, Q21) and feeling disconnected from others are significant here. The mention of fleeting suicidal thoughts (Q11) is a red flag, even though they say they wouldn't act on them. It's important to note that intent is low, but the presence of any suicidal ideation needs attention. \n\nCognitive symptoms like memory issues (Q15) and feeling lost (Q19) could be due to depression's cognitive effects or stress. They also report problems with concentration and decision-making, which ties into their uncertainty about the future. \n\nPatterns here show a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms post-divorce, possibly an adjustment disorder with depressed mood or major depressive disorder. The anxiety symptoms might be a separate anxiety disorder or co-occurring. The stressor (divorce) is a key factor, so adjustment disorder is a consideration. \n\nRisk factors include recent divorce, social withdrawal, and those fleeting suicidal thoughts. They also have physical symptoms exacerbating their condition. Need to check if they meet criteria for MDD, GAD, or adjustment disorder. The cognitive symptoms and functional impairment in daily life (like work and social interactions) are clinically significant. \n\nI should structure this into the points requested: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a summary. Make sure to use DSM-5 terms and avoid assumptions. Highlight the depressive and anxiety symptoms, the stressor, and the suicidal ideation even if not active.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Depressive Features:** Anhedonia (Q2), persistent low mood/hopelessness (Q3), psychomotor agitation (insomnia, daytime fatigue per Q5, Q14), and cognitive slowing (Q15, Q19).  \n- **Anxiety Features:** Generalized anxiety (Q6), panic-like experiences (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8).  \n- **Psychosocial Stressors:** Recent divorce (Q2) and strained interpersonal relationships (Q20-21).  \n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained headaches, abdominal distress (Q9), and sleep disturbances (Q14).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Temporal Association:** Symptoms emerged following marital dissolution, suggesting an adjustment-related etiology.  \n- **Avoidance & Social Withdrawal:** Increased isolation (Q8, Q20-21), reduced social engagement, and role impairment (e.g., work absenteeism).  \n- **Cognitive Disturbances:** Intrusive ruminations (Q16), decision-making uncertainty (Q19), and attentional lapses (Q15.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Criterion A symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, fatigue) with significant functional impairment.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive anxiety (Q6-7, Q9), restlessness, and somatic complaints.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotion and Conduct:** Onset following divorce, prolonged symptoms (\u22652 months post-finalization), and marked distress.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Fleeting passive suicidal thoughts (Q11) warrant further risk assessment (intent, plan, protective factors).  \n- **Functional Decline:** Impaired occupational performance, disrupted routines, and avoidance behaviors risking social withdrawal.  \n- **Chronic Stress Response:** Somatic symptoms (headaches, GI issues) and hypervigilance (Q6) may indicate dysregulation of HPA axis.  \n\n**5. Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **prolonged distress following marital dissolution**, manifesting as depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, psychomotor changes), anxiety (generalized worry, panic-like sensations), and adjustment-related maladaptive coping (social withdrawal, rumination). Cognitive impairment (attention, decision-making) and somatic complaints (headaches, gastrointestinal distress) are notable. **Passive suicidal ideation** and impaired role functioning require prioritization. Rule out MDD with anxious distress, adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance, and GAD. Further evaluate for comorbid PTSD if trauma is present. Risk of escalation in isolation or affective symptoms necessitates targeted intervention.  \n\n**Key DSM-5 Domains Addressed:**  \n- Depressive symptoms (Criteria A for MDD).  \n- Anxiety symptoms (GAD criteria).  \n- Adjustment disorder (stressor-specific distress, functional impairment.  \n- Cognitive/affective reactivity (panic triggers related to ex-partner, Q7.  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Structured clinical interview to assess symptom duration, severity, and diagnostic clarity.  \n- Risk assessment for suicidal ideation and safety planning.  \n- Functional analysis of social/occupational impairment.  \n- Consider somatic symptom disorder if physical complaints persist without medical etiology.",
