      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants a structured assessment based on the provided questionnaire responses. First, I need to make sure I follow the exact structure they specified. The user emphasized compassion and empathy in the first paragraph, so I need to reflect understanding without judgment. \n\nLooking at the responses, the patient mentions anhedonia (Q1) and low mood (Q2), but also hypomanic symptoms like decreased sleep with increased energy (Q4). They also have anxiety (Q6, Q7) managed through alcohol use, and transient suicidal thoughts (Q11). The key here is to balance depressive and hypomanic features without jumping to a diagnosis too quickly.\n\nThe instructions mention avoiding Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly warranted. Since there's a mix of mood and anxiety symptoms with some hypomanic traits, I should consider Bipolar II or a Major Depressive Disorder with atypical features. The hypomanic symptoms don't meet full criteria yet, so maybe a Hypomanic Episode is a possibility, but a Mixed Features Specifier with depression could be another angle. The alcohol use adds another layer, possibly an Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\nNeed to make sure I follow DSM-5 criteria. The suicidal ideation is critical here; even transient thoughts need to be addressed. The patient downplays symptoms, which is a red flag for possible underreporting or denial.\n\nWait, for the diagnosis section, the user wants a specific diagnosis or clinical impression. The patient's symptoms could align with a depressive episode with mixed features, or maybe an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The hypomanic symptoms aren't severe enough for a full hypomanic episode yet, so perhaps a provisional diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (if the criteria are met) or Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) if criteria aren't fully met. Alternatively, considering Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood if stressors are significant. Also, the alcohol use for anxiety suggests possible Alcohol Use Disorder, but they need to meet 2+ criteria from DSM-5. They use alcohol to cope, which is a symptom but not enough yet for a disorder unless it's causing distress. \n\nThe suicidal thoughts (Q11) are present, so that's a critical point. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis might be Major Depressive Disorder, Mild with Mixed Features, but if hypomanic symptoms don't meet the threshold, perhaps Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. Alternatively, considering an Adjustment Disorder. The hypomanic symptoms might be part of stress, so maybe Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. Or maybe a Bipolar II if they have a history of hypomanic episodes but no major depression. Wait, the criteria for hypomanic require elevated mood and 3 other symptoms. The patient mentions starting projects (goal-directed activity), but not the other criteria. So maybe not hypomanic. \n\nAlternatively, Generalized Anxiety Disorder due to the nervousness and use of alcohol to manage anxiety. But the depressive and mixed features are more prominent. \n\nWait, the patient's answer to Q4: \"Sleeping less but still have a lot of energy\" is a classic hypomanic indicator, but if it's only a few days, it might not meet the 4-day requirement for a hypomanic episode. So maybe a Hypomanic Episode (Mild) or Mixed Episode. Hmm.\n\nThe user's instructions also mention the patient's responses to PTSD, but there's no trauma history mentioned here. \n\nThe key points are the mixed depressive/hypomanic symptoms, anxiety, and alcohol use. The diagnosis should reflect the most prominent symptoms while acknowledging uncertainty. Maybe a provisional diagnosis of **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features** as the primary concern, with a secondary consideration of **Alcohol Use Disorder (Mild)** and **Generalized Anxiety Disorder. But need to check if the hypomanic symptoms meet criteria. Alternatively, \"Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder\" is no longer a DSM-5 diagnosis. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 doesn't have \"Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder,\" so perhaps a diagnosis of Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's hypomanic symptoms might be part of an adjustment to stress, so Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood is possible. \n\nGiven that the hypomanic symptoms are present but not clearly meeting full criteria, I'll go with **Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (Provisional)** as the primary. \n\nThen, the alcohol use for anxiety management might be a secondary consideration, but not enough for a full AUD unless other criteria met. \n\nAlso, the suicidal ideation (Q11) needs to be addressed in the recommendations. \n\nOkay, structuring the response now following the specified format. Make sure to use the correct tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes.\n\nDiagnosis should be the most fitting based on the presented data. The patient's hypomanic symptoms (insomnia with increased energy, starting projects) plus depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood) suggest a mixed episode. Since they don't meet full hypomanic criteria (if duration/number of symptoms are insufficient), maybe Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nFinal diagnosis: **Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mixed Features</med> and rule out <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>.** But need to check if \"Mixed Features\" applies to MDD. \n\nWait, DSM-5 allows \"with Mixed Features\" specifier for depressive episodes where hypomanic symptoms occur. So if they have at least three hypomanic symptoms (elevated mood, increased energy/activity, etc.), but the patient hasn't explicitly mentioned euphoric mood. The criteria for \"Mixed Features\" for a major depressive episode requires symptoms from both depressive and manic/hypomanic. The patient has 3 of the 4 hypomanic criteria (insomnia, goal-directed activity, but not sure if increased self-esteem or increased talkativeness. They started projects but don't mention feeling overly self-confident. Maybe only 2 hypomanic symptoms, so maybe not enough. Hmm, maybe better to state provisional until more info. \n\nAlternatively, the diagnosis could be **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood**, as the patient mentions work stress (Q9 mentions back pain from work). \n\nAlternatively, **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)** with intermittent anxiety. \n\nAlternatively, the patient\u2019s hypomanic symptoms plus depressive could be a Mixed Episode Not Otherwise Specified. \n\nAlternatively, **Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Disturbance** (since the anxiety is prominent). \n\nBut the hypomanic symptoms complicate things. Since they don't meet full hypomanic criteria, I might need to be cautious. \n\nPerhaps the safest provisional diagnosis here is **<med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mild</med> with <sym>mixed features</sym> (hypomanic symptoms pending further assessment), rule out <med>Bipolar disorder</med>. Meanwhile, address the substance use and suicidal ideation. \n\nWait, according to DSM-5, the \"with Mixed Features\" specifier for MDD requires at least three hypomanic symptoms. If they have 3, then it fits. The symptoms here:  \n- Insomnia (sleep disturbance), Q4), which counts.  \n- Increased goal-directed activity (starting projects).  \n- Elevated mood? They don\u2019t report feeling high, so maybe not.  \nSo maybe only 2 symptoms, so not meeting criteria. So maybe just Major Depressive Disorder with atypical features (since insomnia instead of hypersomnia). But anhedonia and irritable mood. \n\nAlternatively, **Persistent Depressive Disorder** with episodic hypomanic symptoms. \n\nAlternatively, given the mixed symptoms and possible substance use, the diagnosis could be a **Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**, but no clear substance causing the mood symptoms. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, the best approach is to state a **Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety and mixed features (hypomanic symptoms pending evaluation), and rule out <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>.** \n\nAlso, the alcohol use for anxiety management requires evaluation for possible <med>Alcohol Use Disorder (Mild)</med>.  \n\nThe suicidal ideation needs to be prioritized in treatment steps. \n\nAlright, structuring the answer according to the template, making sure to include all required sections with proper tags. Also, ensure that the diagnosis is provisional and indicates the need for further evaluation. \n\n**First paragraph summary:** Acknowledge their struggle with mood shifts, stress, and the use of alcohol, showing empathy. \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional, considering the uncertainty. \n\n**Reasoning:** Explain the mix of depressive and hypomanic signs, use of alcohol, SI. \n\n**Recommendations:** Address all areas: mood stabilization, substance use evaluation, safety, etc. \n\nMake sure to use the tags correctly: medical terms in <med>, symptoms in <sym>, and their quotes in <quote>. \n\nAlso, the instructions said to avoid assuming disorders not supported by the data. So don't diagnose bipolar unless criteria are met. \n\nWait, the patient answers Q4: sleep less but have energy, that\u2019s one hypomanic symptom (insomnia with increased energy/activity). They started projects (increased activity), so that's two. Need three. Since they don\u2019t mention euphoria or racing thoughts, maybe just two symptoms. So can't diagnose hypomania, so the mixed features specifier might not apply. \n\nThus, better to state <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mild</med> with prominent <sym>anxiety and irritable symptoms</sym>, rule out <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. \n\nOkay, proceeding with",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to process the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questions. Let me start by reading through each question and answer again to make sure I catch all the key points.\n\nStarting with Q1: Little interest or pleasure in doing things. The patient says \"maybe a little\" and mentions not getting excited about hobbies. That's a mild anhedonia, which is a common symptom of depression but they downplay it, saying they're not depressed. \n\nQ2 is about feeling down or hopeless. They respond they're not exactly happy but push through. That suggests some depressive mood but with a sense of coping, maybe? Not full depression but still something there.\n\nQ3 on irritability: They admit to being more irritable but attribute it to stress. So possible increased anger/grouchiness, but they dismiss it as normal stress. \n\nQ4 asks about sleeping less but having energy. They say they stay up but don't feel tired. That's a possible hypomanic symptom if it's coupled with other signs like racing thoughts or goal-directed activity. But they mention not finishing projects, so maybe not. \n\nQ5: Starting projects or risky behaviors. They start projects but don't finish, which might indicate impulsivity or lack of follow-through. The question is about increased activity, which could be part of a manic episode. But the patient is noncommittal here. \n\nQ6: Anxiety symptoms. They say yes but manage with alcohol. The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism is important. It's a maladaptive strategy, so that's a concern. \n\nQ7: Panic or fear. They deny panic but acknowledge some anxiety. The self-medication with alcohol again here. \n\nQ8: Avoiding anxiety-inducing situations. They avoid some places but think it's normal. Maybe avoidance behaviors but not to the point of a phobia yet? \n\nQ9: Aches and pains. Back pain from work, which they dismiss as physical but could be psychosomatic. \n\nQ10: Feeling illnesses aren't taken seriously. They feel their issues are minimized by their doctor. This might indicate some distrust in healthcare providers or unmet needs. \n\nQ11: Suicidal thoughts. They've had fleeting thoughts but no intent. Need to note that even transient thoughts are significant. \n\nQ12 and Q13: No psychotic symptoms, so that's good. \n\nQ14: Sleep quality issues with alcohol use. They use it to fall asleep, which can cause dependency and poor sleep quality. \n\nQ15: Memory lapses. They dismiss it as common, but occasional memory issues might be due to stress, alcohol, or sleep deprivation. \n\nNow, main symptoms: Anhedonia, irritability, insomnia with hyperarousal (not sleeping but still energetic), possible hypomanic features (starting projects but not finishing, risky behaviors?), anxiety managed by alcohol, transient suicidal ideation without intent. \n\nPatterns in responses: Downplaying symptoms (e.g., \"not depressed\", \"everyone gets stressed\"), minimizing concerns by attributing to external factors (work for back pain, normal for memory). Uses alcohol as coping mechanism. \n\nClinical significance areas: Depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low energy, but they don't see it). Wait, but Q4 says they have a lot of energy. Hmm. So maybe mixed features. Need to check: Q4 says they sleep less but have a lot of energy. That's a classic hypomanic symptom. So possible hypomanic episodes? \n\nWait, the patient says they sleep less but have energy, which is a sign of hypomania. But they don't feel tired. So hypomanic symptoms plus some depressive features? Could be a mixed episode? Or maybe bipolar II? \n\nAnxiety symptoms with use of alcohol as a coping mechanism, which is a risk for substance use disorder. The transient suicidal thoughts are another red flag. \n\nRisk factors: Suicidal ideation, even if no intent, still needs to be addressed. The alcohol use as a coping strategy could escalate. The hypomanic symptoms might indicate bipolar spectrum. \n\nPutting this together: The main concerns are possible hypomanic symptoms with concurrent anxiety, substance use (alcohol as self-medication), and transient suicidal ideation. Depressive symptoms are present but minimized by the patient. \n\nPatterns: Minimization, externalizing causes (blaming work for pain, stress for anger), using alcohol to cope, and possible substance misuse. \n\nI need to structure this into the five points as per the user's request. Ensure to not miss the key points like the suicidal thoughts, the possible bipolar features, the alcohol use, and the symptom minimization.\n\nAlso, the patient's answers to Q11 about SI: the patient says \"thoughts of actually hurting yourself?\" answered with \"thought about it once or twice but wouldn't do it.\" So it's non-suicidal SI, but still significant. \n\nAvoiding speculation, just note the facts. \n\nSleep issues with alcohol use affecting sleep quality. Anhedonia and low energy but also insomnia with high energy (hypomania). Wait, in Q4: \"Sleeping less than usual but still have a lot of energy?\" Answer: \"I stay up late sometimes... don't feel tired.\" So that's a classic sign of hypomania. So hypomanic symptoms. \n\nSo putting this into clinical terms: depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood but pushing through), hypomanic symptoms (sleep loss with high energy, starting projects), anxiety symptoms with alcohol use, suicidal ideation, and possible substance use disorder. The patient is minimizing these symptoms, which is a risk because they might not see the need for help. \n\nRisk factors include suicidal thoughts, alcohol as a coping mechanism (which can lead to dependence), and hypomanic features which might indicate bipolar. Also, the SI needs to be addressed further. \n\nPotential areas of significance: Depressive disorder (maybe with atypical features, like insomnia instead of hypersomnia?), bipolar II if the hypomanic symptoms are significant, anxiety disorder, possible alcohol use disorder. \n\nNeed to note that the patient's responses indicate possible mixed features of depression and hypomania, which is a bit confusing. But the DSM-5 criteria for hypomania require elevated mood plus 3 of the symptoms, including increased energy, more talkativeness, etc. The patient mentions starting projects, more energy, but not elevated mood. Hmm. Maybe more like cyclothymia or subthreshold bipolar? Or just a stress response. \n\nAlternatively, the insomnia with high energy could be just stress, but combined with the other symptoms, might need further exploration. \n\nAlso, the patient's use of alcohol to manage anxiety is concerning for possible AUD, especially if they're increasing use. \n\nSo compiling all this into the required points without overstepping. Need to be concise and use clinical terms without assuming diagnoses.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anhedonia:** Reduced interest/pleasure in hobbies (Q1).  \n- **Mild Depressive Symptoms:** Low-grade dysphoric mood (Q2), intermittent irritability (Q3).  \n- **Hypomanic Features:** Sleep disturbance with preserved energy (Q4), impulsivity (unfinished projects, potential risk-taking; Q5).  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Nervousness, self-reported use of alcohol to manage anxiety (Q6, Q7).  \n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Transient thoughts of self-harm (Q11) without intent.  \n- **Psychomotor Agitation:** Sleep disruption with hyperactivity (Q4, Q15).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Minimization of Symptoms:** Dismisses depressive symptoms (\u201cnot depressed\u201d), attributes irritability to stress, and downplays suicidal ideation (\u201cwouldn\u2019t do it\u201d).  \n- **Substance Use as Coping:** Alcohol use to manage anxiety and sleep (Q6, Q14).  \n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Selective avoidance of anxiety-inducing situations (Q8) rationalized as \u201cnormal.\u201d  \n- **Somatization:** Attributes physical symptoms (back pain) to work, not psychological distress (Q9, Q10.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Bipolar Spectrum:** Hypomanic symptoms (elevated energy, reduced sleep, impulsivity) suggest possible hypomanic episode or cyclothymia.  \n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Anxious arousal with maladaptive coping (alcohol use).  \n- **Substance Use Concerns:** Alcohol dependence risk, given use to self-medicate anxiety.  \n- **Mixed Mood Features:** Depressive symptoms co-occurring with energized behaviors may indicate mixed episode or atypical depression.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia with hyperarousal (Q4, Q14.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Transient but concerning, requiring further assessment.  \n- **Self-Medication:** Alcohol use may exacerbate mental health symptoms and increase dependency risk.  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Unfinished projects and irritability may indicate occupational/social stress.  \n- **Denial of Psychiatric Concerns:** Downplaying symptoms could delay treatment engagement.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **mixed depressive, hypomanic, and anxious features**, including anhedonia, irritability, and sleep disturbance with preserved energy. Hypomanic-like symptoms (elevated activity, reduced sleep) warrant further exploration for bipolar spectrum disorder. **Substance use (alcohol) for anxiety management raises risks of dependence and comorbid conditions.** Transient suicidal ideation (Q11) necessitates urgent evaluation for safety and intent.

The hypomanic symptoms don't meet full criteria yet, so maybe a Hypomanic Episode is a possibility, but a Mixed Features Specifier with depression could be another angle. The alcohol use adds another layer, possibly an Alcohol Use Disorder.\n\nNeed to make sure I follow DSM-5 criteria. The suicidal ideation is critical here; even transient thoughts need to be addressed. The patient downplays symptoms, which is a red flag for possible underreporting or denial.\n\nWait, for the diagnosis section, the user wants a specific diagnosis or clinical impression. The patient's symptoms could align with a depressive episode with mixed features, or maybe an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The hypomanic symptoms aren't severe enough for a full hypomanic episode yet, so perhaps a provisional diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (if the criteria are met) or Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) if criteria aren't fully met. Alternatively, considering Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood if stressors are significant. Also, the alcohol use for anxiety suggests possible Alcohol Use Disorder, but they need to meet 2+ criteria from DSM-5. They use alcohol to cope, which is a symptom but not enough yet for a disorder unless it's causing distress. \n\nThe suicidal thoughts (Q11) are present, so that's a critical point. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis might be Major Depressive Disorder, Mild with Mixed Features, but if hypomanic symptoms don't meet the threshold, perhaps Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. Alternatively, considering an Adjustment Disorder. The hypomanic symptoms might be part of stress, so maybe Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood. Or maybe a Bipolar II if they have a history of hypomanic episodes but no major depression. Wait, the criteria for hypomanic require elevated mood and 3 other symptoms. The patient mentions starting projects (goal-directed activity), but not the other criteria. So maybe not hypomanic. \n\nAlternatively, Generalized Anxiety Disorder due to the nervousness and use of alcohol to manage anxiety. But the depressive and mixed features are more prominent. \n\nWait, the patient's answer to Q4: \"Sleeping less but still have a lot of energy\" is a classic hypomanic indicator, but if it's only a few days, it might not meet the 4-day requirement for a hypomanic episode. So maybe a Hypomanic Episode (Mild) or Mixed Episode. Hmm.\n\nThe user's instructions also mention the patient's responses to PTSD, but there's no trauma history mentioned here. \n\nThe key points are the mixed depressive/hypomanic symptoms, anxiety, and alcohol use. The diagnosis should reflect the most prominent symptoms while acknowledging uncertainty. Maybe a provisional diagnosis of **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features** as the primary concern, with a secondary consideration of **Alcohol Use Disorder (Mild)** and **Generalized Anxiety Disorder. But need to check if the hypomanic symptoms meet criteria. Alternatively, \"Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder\" is no longer a DSM-5 diagnosis. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 doesn't have \"Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder,\" so perhaps a diagnosis of Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's hypomanic symptoms might be part of an adjustment to stress, so Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood is possible. \n\nGiven that the hypomanic symptoms are present but not clearly meeting full criteria, I'll go with **Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (Provisional)** as the primary. \n\nThen, the alcohol use for anxiety management might be a secondary consideration, but not enough for a full AUD unless other criteria met. \n\nAlso, the suicidal ideation (Q11) needs to be addressed in the recommendations. \n\nOkay, structuring the response now following the specified format. Make sure to use the correct tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes.\n\nDiagnosis should be the most fitting based on the presented data. The patient's hypomanic symptoms (insomnia with increased energy, starting projects) plus depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood) suggest a mixed episode. Since they don't meet full hypomanic criteria (if duration/number of symptoms are insufficient), maybe Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nFinal diagnosis: **Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mixed Features</med> and rule out <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>.** But need to check if \"Mixed Features\" applies to MDD. \n\nWait, DSM-5 allows \"with Mixed Features\" specifier for depressive episodes where hypomanic symptoms occur. So if they have at least three hypomanic symptoms (elevated mood, increased energy/activity, etc.), but the patient hasn't explicitly mentioned euphoric mood. The criteria for \"Mixed Features\" for a major depressive episode requires symptoms from both depressive and manic/hypomanic. The patient has 3 of the 4 hypomanic criteria (insomnia, goal-directed activity, but not sure if increased self-esteem or increased talkativeness. They started projects but don't mention feeling overly self-confident. Maybe only 2 hypomanic symptoms, so maybe not enough. Hmm, maybe better to state provisional until more info. \n\nAlternatively, the diagnosis could be **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood**, as the patient mentions work stress (Q9 mentions back pain from work). \n\nAlternatively, **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)** with intermittent anxiety. \n\nAlternatively, the patient\u2019s hypomanic symptoms plus depressive could be a Mixed Episode Not Otherwise Specified. \n\nAlternatively, **Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Disturbance** (since the anxiety is prominent). \n\nBut the hypomanic symptoms complicate things. Since they don't meet full hypomanic criteria, I might need to be cautious. \n\nPerhaps the safest provisional diagnosis here is **<med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mild</med> with <sym>mixed features</sym> (hypomanic symptoms pending further assessment), rule out <med>Bipolar disorder</med>. Meanwhile, address the substance use and suicidal ideation. \n\nWait, according to DSM-5, the \"with Mixed Features\" specifier for MDD requires at least three hypomanic symptoms. If they have 3, then it fits. The symptoms here:  \n- Insomnia (sleep disturbance), Q4), which counts.  \n- Increased goal-directed activity (starting projects).  \n- Elevated mood? They don\u2019t report feeling high, so maybe not.  \nSo maybe only 2 symptoms, so not meeting criteria. So maybe just Major Depressive Disorder with atypical features (since insomnia instead of hypersomnia). But anhedonia and irritable mood. \n\nAlternatively, **Persistent Depressive Disorder** with episodic hypomanic symptoms. \n\nAlternatively, given the mixed symptoms and possible substance use, the diagnosis could be a **Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**, but no clear substance causing the mood symptoms. \n\nHmm. Given the uncertainty, the best approach is to state a **Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety and mixed features (hypomanic symptoms pending evaluation), and rule out <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>.** \n\nAlso, the alcohol use for anxiety management requires evaluation for possible <med>Alcohol Use Disorder (Mild)</med>.  \n\nThe suicidal ideation needs to be prioritized in treatment steps. \n\nAlright, structuring the answer according to the template, making sure to include all required sections with proper tags. Also, ensure that the diagnosis is provisional and indicates the need for further evaluation. \n\n**First paragraph summary:** Acknowledge their struggle with mood shifts, stress, and the use of alcohol, showing empathy. \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional, considering the uncertainty. \n\n**Reasoning:** Explain the mix of depressive and hypomanic signs, use of alcohol, SI. \n\n**Recommendations:** Address all areas: mood stabilization, substance use evaluation, safety, etc. \n\nMake sure to use the tags correctly: medical terms in <med>, symptoms in <sym>, and their quotes in <quote>. \n\nAlso, the instructions said to avoid assuming disorders not supported by the data. So don't diagnose bipolar unless criteria are met. \n\nWait, the patient answers Q4: sleep less but have energy, that\u2019s one hypomanic symptom (insomnia with increased energy/activity). They started projects (increased activity), so that's two. Need three. Since they don\u2019t mention euphoria or racing thoughts, maybe just two symptoms. So can't diagnose hypomania, so the mixed features specifier might not apply. \n\nThus, better to state <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Mild</med> with prominent <sym>anxiety and irritable symptoms</sym>, rule out <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. \n\nOkay, proceeding with",
