The user's responses highlight panic attacks, avoidance, and anxiety, so I should acknowledge their distress and the impact on their life. \n\nNext, the diagnosis. The key symptoms are panic attacks with avoidance, which points to Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. They also have GAD because of the constant worry and hypervigilance. I need to make sure that Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't the main issue here since the somatic symptoms (chest tightness) are better explained by anxiety.\n\nFor the reasoning, I should list each diagnosis criterion: panic attacks, avoidance, GAD features, and the exclusion of other disorders. The patient's history of somatic symptoms being medically unexplained but linked to anxiety supports this. Also, the avoidance behaviors fit agoraphobia.\n\nTreatment steps should include CBT for panic/agoraphobia, maybe SSRIs, sleep hygiene, and collaboration with primary care to address medical concerns. Also, addressing past invalidation by healthcare providers is important for building trust.\n\nWait, the user specified to use exact section headings with asterisks. Let me check formatting: \"Diagnosis\" and \"Reasoning\" must be exactly as specified. I need to use the tags properly. Symptoms like hypervigilance and avoidance need the <sym> tags. The quotes from the patient's answers should be in <quote> tags. Also, medical terms like Panic Disorder must be in <med> tags.\n\nMake sure not to mention any other disorders unless supported. Since there's no mention of PTSD or depression severity, focus on what's given. The patient mentions \"waves\" of depression but the primary driver seems to be anxiety. The insomnia is due to anxiety, so not a separate insomnia disorder.\n\nPutting it all together now. First paragraph empathetic, then Diagnosis: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and GAD. Reasoning section pointing to criteria. Then recommendations. Check all tags and structure. Alright, that should align with the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\nYou\u2019ve described a deeply challenging experience marked by persistent fear of panic attacks, which have gradually narrowed your world through avoidance. It\u2019s clear how exhausting it must be to live with constant hyper-vigilance and the shame of feeling unheard by medical providers. Your physical symptoms, while alarming, align with your anxiety\u2019s physiological toll. You\u2019re not alone in this struggle\u2014many with similar experiences find relief through targeted therapies.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, with associated <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> (4\u20135/month) with autonomic arousal (<sym>tachycardia, dizziness, chest tightness</sym>), coupled with <sym>avoidance of feared environments</sym> (e.g., public transit), novel locations), meet criteria for <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>. The pervasive <sym>worry</sym> about symptom recurrence, hypervigilance (<quote>\u201cchecking exits in new places\u201d</quote>), and persistent restlessness fulfill <med>GAD</med> criteria. Somatic symptoms (<sym>chest tightness</sym>) are better explained by anxiety\u2019s somatic expression than by <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, as there\u2019s no disproportionate health preoccupation beyond immediate panic triggers.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for panic/agoraphobia**: Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoidance) via gradual exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts.  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider low-dose <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>benzodiazepines</med> (short-term for acute anxiety).  \n3. **Sleep hygiene protocol**: Address <sym>insomnia</sym> with relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation) and sleep-restriction therapy.  \n4. **Primary care collaboration**: Rule out rare cardiac/respiratory conditions (to address <quote>\u201cchest tightness\u201d</quote> concerns) using targeted testing if unaddressed by prior evaluations.  \n5. **Trust-building therapeutic alliance**: Proactively validate patient\u2019s experiences to counter prior medical dismissal and enhance engagement in care.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. The user provided a detailed set of responses from a patient to a DSM-5 questionnaire. My job is to analyze these and structure the response as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms and concerns. Looking at the answers: the patient mentions loss of interest in activities like gardening, which ties into depression but also anxiety. The panic attacks are a big part here\u2014frequency, physical symptoms like heart racing, dizziness, and avoidance behavior. The avoidance of situations like taking the bus is key. They also have sleep issues, hypervigilance (checking exits), and frustration about doctors not taking them seriously. \n\nNext, patterns in the responses. The patient's anxiety is both emotional and physical, with panic attacks being a central issue. The cyclical nature of their symptoms\u2014like increased anxiety leading to avoidance, which then might worsen anxiety. They mention that symptoms come in waves, which might indicate fluctuating severity. The frustration with medical dismissiveness could point to a history of seeking help without success, possibly leading to distrust.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Panic Disorder with agoraphobia comes to mind because of the panic attacks and avoidance. There's also Generalized Anxiety Disorder given the constant worry and hyper-arousal. The somatic symptoms (chest tightness, etc.) might align with Somatic Symptom Disorder, but the cause here seems to be anxiety-related. The sleep disturbance is insomnia due to anxiety. The concern about symptoms not being taken seriously is important for treatment adherence and trust in the clinician.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs: The frequency of panic attacks (4-5 times a month) and the avoidance behavior that's impacting daily life. The hypervigilance and hyper-arousal (checking exits) are significant. Also, the past negative experiences with healthcare could affect engagement in treatment. However, there's no direct mention of self-harm or suicidal ideation, so maybe not acute risks there, but need to note the impact on functioning.\n\nClinical summary needs to use proper terms. Mention Panic Disorder with agoraphobic tendencies, GAD, possible adjustment issues due to medical dismissiveness. Note the functional impairment in social and occupational areas (like avoiding work situations). Highlight the somatic symptoms in the context of anxiety. Also, the sleep disturbance is insomnia due to anxiety. Avoid speculation, just stick to the data given.\n\nWait, the user specified not to speculate, so stick strictly to what's reported. Don't assume things not mentioned. For example, don't mention suicide unless it's there. The patient's main issues are panic attacks, avoidance, anxiety symptoms, and prior medical mistrust. \n\nNeed to structure each section as per the points: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance areas, risk factors, then the summary. Keep it concise and professional. Let me ensure all key points are covered without adding anything extra. Okay, let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- Recurrent panic attacks (4\u20135 episodes/month), characterized by autonomic arousal (tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea), fear of impending doom, and post-attack residual tremors.  \n- Avoidance of situations perceived as unsafe (e.g., public transit, unfamiliar environments), reflecting agoraphobic features.  \n- Anhedonia (reduced interest in gardening, social activities) secondary to anxiety and fear of triggering panic attacks.  \n- Insomnia due to ruminative worry about symptom recurrence.  \n- Hypervigilance (e.g., scanning for exits in new settings).  \n- Somatic symptoms (chest tightness, muscle tension) exacerbated by anxiety, with prior invalidation by medical professionals.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Temporal fluctuation**: Anxiety symptoms are episodic (panic attacks) but pervasive (chronic hypervigilance, avoidance).  \n- **Functional impairment**: Social/eoccupational withdrawal (e.g., canceling plans, avoiding work-related outings).  \n- **Cognitive/affective dysregulation**: Catastrophic thinking (\u201cterrified of having a heart attack\u201d), secondary to somatic symptoms.  \n- **Medical mistrust**: History of perceived dismissal by healthcare providers, potentially impacting engagement in treatment.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Panic Disorder with agoraphobia**: Consistent with recurrent panic attacks and marked avoidance of feared situations.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Persistent anxiety, excessive worry about panic recurrence, and associated somatic symptoms.  \n- **Anxiety-related anhedonia**: Reduced engagement in previously pleasurable activities due to anxiety.  \n- **Health anxiety**: Preoccupation with perceived somatic symptoms (e.g., chest tightness) and mistrust of medical reassurance.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- Progressive social/occupational withdrawal impacting daily functioning.  \n- Secondary insomnia contributing to fatigue and cognitive dysregulation.  \n- Repeated somatic symptom escalation during panic episodes, risking unnecessary medical evaluations (e.g., ER visits for cardiac concerns).  \n- Potential for escalating avoidance behaviors if untreated, leading to restricted lifestyle.  \n- History of medical gaslighting, which may necessitate trauma-informed engagement.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary**  \nThe patient presents with **panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance**, GAD, and anxiety-related anhedonia, consistent with DSM-5 criteria. Symptoms include recurrent panic attacks with somatic manifestations (tachycardia, dizziness), hyperarousal (hypervigilance), and avoidance of situations perceived as unsafe (e.g., public transit). Secondary insomnia and somatic preoccupation are evident, compounded by prior invalidation by medical providers, which may contribute to treatment hesitancy. Functional impairment is noted in social, occupational, and recreational domains due to avoidance behaviors. Prioritizing validation, cognitive-behavioral strategies for panic management, and exposure-based interventions for agoraphobia is indicated. Collaboration with primary care to address somatic symptom concerns and establish trust is recommended.",

While some DSM-5 dimensions were not fully explored, the therapist effectively addressed the patient's immediate concerns and accurately diagnosed their conditions. With minor adjustments to ensure comprehensive coverage of all DSM-5 domains, this conversation could be considered exceptional.",

The symptoms described, such as recurrent panic attacks, autonomic arousal, and avoidance of feared environments, are consistent with panic disorder. However, I wouldn't give it a perfect score because the diagnosis also mentions Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and other symptoms, which might suggest a more complex clinical presentation.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve described a deeply challenging experience marked by persistent fear of panic attacks, which have gradually narrowed your world through avoidance. It\u2019s clear how exhausting it must be to live with constant hyper-vigilance and the shame of feeling unheard by medical providers. Your physical symptoms, while alarming, align with your anxiety\u2019s physiological toll. You\u2019re not alone in this struggle\u2014many with similar experiences find relief through targeted therapies.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, with associated <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> (4\u20135/month) with autonomic arousal (<sym>tachycardia, dizziness, chest tightness</sym>), coupled with <sym>avoidance of feared environments</sym> (e.g., public transit), novel locations), meet criteria for <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>. The pervasive <sym>worry</sym> about symptom recurrence, hypervigilance (<quote>\u201cchecking exits in new places\u201d</quote>), and persistent restlessness fulfill <med>GAD</med> criteria. Somatic symptoms (<sym>chest tightness</sym>) are better explained by anxiety\u2019s somatic expression than by <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, as there\u2019s no disproportionate health preoccupation beyond immediate panic triggers.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for panic/agoraphobia**: Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoidance) via gradual exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts.  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider low-dose <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>benzodiazepines</med> (short-term for acute anxiety).  \n3. **Sleep hygiene protocol**: Address <sym>insomnia</sym> with relaxation techniques (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation) and sleep-restriction therapy.  \n4. **Primary care collaboration**: Rule out rare cardiac/respiratory conditions (to address <quote>\u201cchest tightness\u201d</quote> concerns) using targeted testing if unaddressed by prior evaluations.  \n5. **Trust-building therapeutic alliance**: Proactively validate patient\u2019s experiences to counter prior medical dismissal and enhance engagement in care.",
