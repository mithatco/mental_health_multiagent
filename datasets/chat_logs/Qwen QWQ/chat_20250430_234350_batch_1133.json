      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to create a comprehensive mental health assessment based on the user's responses. Let's start by reading through the answers again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe patient answered \"No\" to questions about increased energy or risky behavior (Q4, Q5), which rules out mania, so bipolar is less likely. The anhedonia, depressed mood, and hopelessness from Q2 and Q3 point to depression. The irritability (Q4) is common in depression too, especially in some populations. The somatic symptoms (Q9 and Q10) are likely stress-related but need to be considered alongside other factors.\n\nThe key here is to structure the response exactly as the user specified. The user emphasized using the exact headings, tags, and order. Let me make sure each section is properly formatted. The compassionate summary should reflect empathy, highlighting their struggles with divorce and the resulting symptoms without judgment. \n\nFor the diagnosis, the main options here are Major Depressive Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, or possibly an Anxiety Disorder. Since the symptoms align closely with MDD criteria (anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep changes, fatigue, anxiety, and somatic symptoms), that seems primary. The adjustment disorder is a contender because of the stressor (divorce), but the duration (2 weeks) might fit better with MDD. The DSM-5 requires at least two weeks for MDD, which matches here. \n\nThe reasoning should explain why other disorders were considered and why MDD was chosen. Also, note the anxiety features and adjustment as possible comorbidities. \n\nNext steps should include therapy, medication evaluation, stress management, and monitoring somatic symptoms. I have to make sure each recommendation is numbered and clear. \n\nTags are crucial: wrapping medical terms like Major Depressive Disorder in <med> tags, symptoms like anhedonia in <sym>, and quotes like \"I feel stuck in this dark space\" in <quote>. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"do not include raw reference text\" so I shouldn't reference DSM-5 directly in the assessment. Also, ensure the diagnosis isn't Somatic Symptom Disorder unless the criteria are met. The patient reported that their doctor found no physical cause, but they're not excessively preoccupied with illness, so SSD might not fit. \n\nI should also check if PTSD is a consideration. The stressor is divorce, which might not be a trauma, so maybe not PTSD but Adjustment Disorder. But given the duration, MDD is more likely. The anxiety symptoms (restlessness, avoidance) could align with GAD. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features and adjustment issues. The next steps should address both depression and anxiety, plus the stressor. \n\nMake sure the compassionate summary acknowledges the divorce impact, their feelings of hopelessness, and the physical and emotional toll. Avoid jargon to keep it empathetic. \n\nDouble-check the structure: sections must be in order, correct headings with asterisks, proper tags, and no markdown. The diagnosis line should be directly after the heading. \n\nYes, that should cover it. Now, time to format it precisely.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest in activities</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> color your journey through this tough time since the divorce.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a set of patient responses to a DSM-5 questionnaire and wants a clinical summary. First, I need to go through each of the answers to identify the key symptoms and concerns.\n\nStarting with Q2, the patient mentions little interest or pleasure since the divorce, which has been ongoing for most days. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, a key symptom of depression. Q3 talks about feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, which aligns with depressive symptoms as well. The patient also reports irritability (Q4), which can be part of depression, especially in some populations. \n\nLooking at sleep issues (Q5), they mention sleeping too much, which is hypersomnia, another depressive indicator. Lack of increased energy or risky behavior (Q5) counters mania, so probably not bipolar. The anxiety symptoms in Q6 and Q7 (nervousness, worry, occasional panic-like sensations) suggest anxiety comorbid with depression. Avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8) points to possible avoidance behaviors, maybe anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder. \n\nPhysical symptoms like aches and pains (Q9) without physical cause are often somatic complaints linked to stress or depression. The mention of feeling unheard (Q10) might indicate some frustration with healthcare, but not exactly a lack of empathy from the doctor. \n\nNow, patterns: The divorce is a significant stressor, so the symptoms likely started around that event. The symptoms have been persistent over the past two weeks, as per the assessment timeframe. There's a mix of depressive and anxiety symptoms, suggesting a possible major depressive disorder with anxious distress, or an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. \n\nClinical significance areas would include the presence of anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Risk factors include recent divorce as a stressor. The patient's irritability and social withdrawal could affect relationships and daily functioning. There's no mention of suicidal ideation, but persistent symptoms and functional impairment are notable. \n\nI need to make sure not to miss any key points. Let me check each answer again. The patient's responses are pretty consistent with a depressive disorder, possibly with anxiety features. The avoidance behaviors and somatic symptoms need to be highlighted as clinically significant. The stressor (divorce) is a key risk factor. \n\nAlso, the patient doesn't report manic symptoms, so bipolar is less likely here. The physical symptoms are stress-related, so maybe somatic symptom disorder is part of it, but more likely part of the depressive/anxiety presentation. \n\nNeed to structure the summary into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance areas, risk factors, and a clinical summary. Avoid speculation, so stick to what's reported. \n\nWait, in Q11, the patient says they don't feel their illnesses are not taken seriously, so maybe they feel their concerns are being heard, but there's some doubt. So not a risk factor for lack of medical care. \n\nPutting it all together, the main points are depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, hypersomnia), anxiety (restlessness, worry), irritability, social withdrawal, somatic complaints. The stressor is recent divorce. Clinical significance areas would include depressive disorder, anxiety, adjustment issues. Risk factors include the divorce as a major life stressor and ongoing social impairment. \n\nOkay, time to format this into the required sections without fluff. Use clinical terms but stay concise.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Persistent anhedonia** (loss of interest/pleasure) and **depressed mood** (feelings of hopelessness, darkness) linked to recent divorce.  \n- **Irritability/anger** impacting interpersonal relationships (e.g., conflicts at work, strained family dynamics).  \n- **Hypersomnia** (excessive sleep) and **restlessness/anxiety** (racing thoughts, pacing).  \n- **Psychophysiological symptoms** (e.g., gastrointestinal and headache pain attributed to stress).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms began following **significant life stressor (divorce)** and persist \u22652 weeks.  \n- **Mixed affective presentation**: depressive symptoms (anhedonia, guilt/hopelessness) co-occurring with anxiety (restlessness, worry, avoidance).  \n- **Functional impairment**: Social withdrawal (avoidance of obligations/social interactions), reduced motivation/initiative.  \n- **Self-awareness**: Patient acknowledges symptoms but questions their validity (e.g., \"I wonder if I\u2019m overreacting\").  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Core symptoms of anhedonia, low mood, sleep disturbance, and psychomotor changes (e.g., excessive sleep, restlessness).  \n- **Anxiety disorder** (Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder): Restlessness, excessive worry, and avoidance behaviors.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and Anxiety**: Symptom onset temporally linked to divorce.  \n- **Somatic symptom exacerbation** (headaches, stomachaches) linked to psychological distress.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Recent major life stressor** (divorce), a recognized trigger for mood and anxiety disorders.  \n- **Social withdrawal** and strained relationships, amplifying isolation.  \n- **Irritability** may risk interpersonal conflict or self-esteem erosion.  \n- No acute suicidal/harm ideation reported, but chronic symptom persistence raises concern for functional decline.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with a **two-week history of persistent anhedonia, depressed mood, and psychomotor changes (hypersomnia, restlessness)** consistent with **Major Depressive Disorder**. Concurrent **generalized anxiety** (excessive worry, somatic restlessness) and **avoidant behaviors** suggest a **mixed anxiety-depressive disorder or adjustment disorder with comorbid anxiety**. Symptoms emerged following a **major psychosocial stressor (divorce)**, indicating significant stress vulnerability. **Irritability** and social withdrawal may exacerbate interpersonal dysfunction. Somatic symptoms (headaches, gastrointestinal distress) are likely stress-mediated, per patient report of no organic cause. No acute risk of self-harm is noted, but chronic symptom persistence may necessitate evaluation for functional impairment and comorbidities (e.g., adjustment disorder, GAD). Further assessment required to rule out bipolar features or atypical depression.",

The weight of these feelings has seeped into your daily life, leaving you exhausted, disconnected from joy, and struggling to face even routine tasks. The physical toll\u2014<sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomachaches</sym>\u2014adds to your distress, making it hard to believe you\u2019re being heard, even when loved ones and doctors try to help. You\u2019re managing this alone, and the cycle of restlessness and avoidance feels inescapable.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxiety distress</med> and <med>adjustment difficulties</med>, possibly comorbid with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>low mood</sym>, and <sym>hypersomnia</sym> meet <med>MDD</med> criteria (DSM-5). The <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or the <med>anxious distress specifier</med> for <med>MDD</med>. The divorce is a clear stressor, but symptoms exceed adjustment disorder criteria (severity and duration warrant a primary mood/anxiety diagnosis. No evidence of <med>BD</med> given no manic/hypomanic symptoms. Somatic symptoms align with stress and mood disorders rather than <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (no excessive preoccupation with illness).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Psychotherapy**: Begin <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address maladaptive thought patterns and improve coping with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.  \n2. **Medication evaluation**: Discuss <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertralaline) to target depressive and anxious symptoms.  \n3. **Social support engagement**: Gradual reengagement in low-stress social activities to counteract <sym>isolation</sym>.  \n4. **Mindfulness/relaxation training**: To reduce <sym>restlessness</sym> and somatic symptoms.  \n5. **Medical reassurance**: Collaborate with primary care to monitor stress-related symptoms (e.g., headaches), emphasizing that physical symptoms are valid even when not life-threatening.  \n6. **Monitor for suicidal ideation**: Though not currently present, persistent hopelessness requires ongoing assessment.  \n\nThis approach balances addressing mood, anxiety, and social functioning while validating your experience of <sym>physical distress</sym>. You\u2019re not overreacting\u2014you\u2019re struggling valiantly, and this plan is designed to help rebuild strength and connection.",
