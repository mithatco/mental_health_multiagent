      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the user's responses again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The user is clearly struggling with social interactions and has a lot of anxiety around them. The key points from the answers are the avoidance of social events, physical symptoms like headaches and stomach aches when facing social situations, and the intrusive thoughts about others judging them. They mentioned avoiding meetings, a wedding, and feeling detached during events. They also have some cognitive symptoms like poor memory during conversations. \n\nFirst, I need to check if these symptoms fit into a specific diagnosis. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the immediate thought because of the avoidance and fear of negative evaluation. But I should also consider if there's any OCD component because of the repetitive thoughts and checking behaviors. The user mentioned rehearsing lines and checking emails to avoid things. However, those behaviors might be more about anxiety management rather than OCD compulsions. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of scrutiny, avoidance behaviors, and significant distress. The user's panic symptoms (like heart racing, lightheadedness) in big groups align with panic attacks in specific situations. The somatic symptoms like headaches and stomach aches are common in anxiety disorders too. \n\nAvoidant Personality Disorder could be a consideration here because the user mentions feeling like an outsider, not feeling close to others, and possible hypersensitivity to criticism. But the DSM-5 doesn't have an official Avoidant Personality Disorder, but it's listed in Section II. However, the user's social anxiety symptoms are more prominent, so SAD takes priority. \n\nThe user also mentioned intrusive thoughts like \"they hate me\" which could be part of SAD's fear of negative evaluation, not necessarily OCD. The rituals like checking emails or rehearsing lines are avoidance strategies, not compulsions to reduce anxiety about other fears. \n\nThe physical symptoms (headaches, panic sensations) are better explained by the anxiety response. The detachment during events (depersonalization) is a common anxiety response to stress. \n\nSubstance use is minimal, so that's not a major factor here. The user's main issues revolve around social interactions and the anxiety associated with them. \n\nPutting this together, the primary diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder. The Avoidant Personality Disorder traits might be present but likely secondary. No signs of depression or psychosis. The cognitive symptoms (memory blips during conversations) could be stress-related or due to high anxiety during social interactions.\n\nNext steps would involve CBT for SAD, monitoring for possible comorbid GAD, and considering medication if needed. The user needs a safe environment to discuss their fears and learn coping strategies.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms of social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and physical distress in social contexts</sym> suggest profound struggles with social interactions, likely causing <sym>significant distress</sym> and impairment in work and relationships.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through each of the patient's answers to figure out what's going on here. \n\nFirst, the patient says they lack interest in social activities but are okay alone. That's a common symptom in social anxiety. Then, they mention feeling nervous, anxious, and on edge a lot, especially before social events. They also have panic attacks in big groups. Avoidance behaviors like skipping meetings and avoiding parties are clear. The physical symptoms like stomach aches and headaches before social interactions are stress-related, likely due to anxiety. \n\nThey feel others don't take their issues seriously, which might lead to feelings of invalidation. They don't have suicidal thoughts, which is good, but they do have intrusive thoughts about what others think of them, like \"they hate me,\" which sounds like obsessive thinking. Their need to check emails or rehearse lines might be compulsive behaviors, possibly related to OCD. \n\nThe depersonalization during events (feeling detached) is another red flag. They feel disconnected from others and can't enjoy relationships, which points to social anxiety or maybe avoidant personality disorder. They don't misuse substances except maybe social drinking, which they've cut down, so that's a plus. \n\nPutting this together, the main issues are social anxiety with significant avoidance, physical symptoms, and intrusive thoughts. The compulsive checking and rehearsing might be part of an anxiety disorder. The depersonalization and feelings of disconnection could be part of the anxiety or related to another condition. \n\nI should check if these symptoms fit into DSM-5 criteria. Social anxiety disorder is the top candidate. The obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors might overlap with OCD features, but they might be better explained by anxiety. The avoidance and distress in social situations would definitely be a big part. \n\nThey also reported sleep disturbances due to ruminating on social interactions, which is common in anxiety. The lack of substance abuse except minimal social drinking isn't a major issue here. The feeling of not being understood by others might contribute to their distress.\n\nI need to make sure there's no major depressive disorder here. They don't report persistent depressed mood, just feeling sad when thinking of loneliness. So probably not depression but anxiety. The panic attacks in specific situations (big groups) align with social anxiety. \n\nThe key points are the avoidance, social anxiety symptoms, physical symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and some possible OCD features. Need to mention clinical significance in terms of impairment in functioning, like avoiding work meetings and a wedding, which impacts their life significantly. \n\nRisk factors: the patient isn't suicidal, but their avoidance could lead to social isolation. The anxiety might be worsening if not addressed. The need to check and rehearse might be a coping mechanism but also part of the disorder.\n\nHmm, also the depersonalization and derealization episodes during social events could be part of the anxiety response. The patient's self-report is very consistent with social anxiety disorder. The intrusive thoughts are more anxiety-related rumination than OCD, unless there's a compulsion to act on them. Since they mentioned rituals like checking emails to avoid, maybe that's avoidance as part of anxiety rather than OCD compulsions. \n\nThe main clinical areas here would be social anxiety disorder, possible GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) given the constant worry, but the social focus is more specific. The somatic symptoms (stomach aches, headaches) are a physical manifestation. The emotional symptoms include anxiety, nervousness, and fear of judgment. \n\nPotential areas to consider: Social Anxiety Disorder, maybe Avoidant Personality Disorder, but the DSM-5 criteria for that would need more info on long-term patterns. The intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors could be part of the anxiety rather than a separate OCD diagnosis. Need to note the functional impairment from avoiding social situations, which affects their work and relationships. \n\nI should structure the answer as per the user's instructions, making sure each point is covered concisely. Ensure not to speculate but stick to what's presented. The summary needs to use clinical terms like avoidance behaviors, social phobia, somatic symptoms, etc.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Avoidance and Anxiety:** Marked avoidance of social interactions (e.g., skipping work meetings, declining social events) due to fear of judgment, embarrassment, or perceived inadequacy.  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent nervousness, tension, and physiological arousal (e.g., stomach aches, headaches, restlessness) triggered by anticipated social interactions.  \n- **Repetitive and Intrusive Thoughts:** Recurrent intrusive thoughts (e.g., \"they hate me\"), ruminative thinking about social performance, and mental rehearsal of interactions.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia exacerbated by preoccupation with social encounters.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Social vs. Non-Social Functioning:** Symptoms cluster around social/performance situations, with intact functioning in solitude.  \n- **Excessive Self-Monitoring:** Preoccupation with perceived negative evaluation by others (e.g., checking appearance before leaving home).  \n- **Cognitive Behavioral Coping:** Ritualistic behaviors (e.g., rehearsing lines, repetitive checking) to mitigate anticipatory anxiety.  \n- **Validation Craving:** Reports feeling misunderstood by others, suggesting potential impact on self-esteem and social support systems.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Core features of fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of social/performance situations, and associated somatic symptoms.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Chronic worry about social interactions, though symptoms are context-specific.  \n- **Possible OCD Features:** Intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors may reflect anxiety-driven compulsions (e.g., mental rehearsal, checking).  \n- **Avoidant Personality Disorder (APD):** Themes of social inhibition, hypersensitivity to criticism, and feelings of inadequacy warrant consideration.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance of meaningful social and occupational obligations (e.g., missing work meetings, declining social invitations).  \n- **Physical Complaints:** Somatization (e.g., headaches, abdominal pain) tied to anxiety triggers.  \n- **Emotional Dysregulation:** Occasional irritability linked to heightened anxiety.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary (DSM-5 Framework):**  \nThe patient presents with **prolonged, context-specific anxiety and avoidance of social interactions consistent with Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22)**. Key features include anticipatory anxiety, physical symptoms (e.g., panic-like sensations in crowds), and significant avoidance (e.g., work/school impairment, social withdrawal). Secondary features include **intrusive ruminations**, **somatic complaints**, and **ritualistic behaviors** (e.g., mental rehearsals, checking) suggestive of anxiety-driven coping strategies. No acute suicidal/homicidal risk detected. Minimal substance use concerns; patient denies compulsive substance misuse. Further evaluation required to assess for comorbidities (e.g., GAD, APD) and explore impact on interpersonal functioning.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Symptoms of social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and physical distress in social contexts</sym> suggest profound struggles with social interactions, likely causing <sym>significant distress</sym> and impairment in work and relationships. Your descriptions of <sym>rehearsing lines, checking behaviors, and physical symptoms like headaches</sym> reflect a pattern of <sym>vulnerability to social judgment</sym> that feels overwhelming. It\u2019s clear how isolatinging these experiences must be, and your efforts to manage them\u2014like avoiding events or retreating alone\u2014highlight both your resilience and the need for targeted support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22)</med> with associated <med>Avoidant Personality Traits</med>, and <med>Somatic Symptoms Disorder</med> (headaches, gastrointestinal distress) tied to psychological stress.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe <quote>\"fear of negative evaluation\"</quote> and <sym>avoidance of social/performance situations</sym> (e.g., skipping a friend\u2019s wedding) align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> criteria. The <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym> (racing heart, lightheadedness in groups) suggest <med>anticipatory anxiety</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (<quote>\"they hate me\"</quote>) and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (rehearsing lines, checking emails to avoid interactions) reflect <med>cognitive-behavioral strategies to mitigate social anxiety</med> rather than <med>OCD</med>, as there\u2019s no evidence of true compulsions or obsessions unrelated to social evaluation. The <sym>detachment during social events</sym> (<med>depersonalization</med>) and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> (headaches, stomach aches) are secondary to anxiety arousal.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., checking, rehearsing lines) and <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> (e.g., \"they hate me\") through exposure exercises and cognitive restructuring.  \n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) for <sym>anxiety reduction</med> if CBT alone isn\u2019t sufficient.  \n3. **Social Skills Training:** Practice gradual, structured social interactions to reduce anticipatory <sym>hypervigilance</sym> and physical symptoms.  \n4. **Psychological Assessment:** Rule out <med>Avoidant Personality Disorder</med> with formal personality inventory (e.g., PDQ-4+).  \n5. **Somatic Symptom Monitoring:** Track <sym>headaches/stomach aches</sym> to ensure they aren\u2019t part of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>; ensure symptoms correlate directly with social stressors.  \n6. **Support Networks:** Encourage joining <sym>low-pressure social groups</sym> (e.g., small gatherings, hobby-based clubs) to rebuild social confidence.  \n\nThis is a manageable condition, and with structured support, many people experience meaningful improvement.
