      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the clinical assessment based on the user's responses. Let me start with the compassionate summary. The patient is clearly struggling with a combination of depressive, psychotic, and anxiety symptoms. I should acknowledge their distress and the impact on their daily life.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The key symptoms are depression with psychotic features, like hallucinations and delusions, along with anxiety and panic. The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features (MDD w/ Psychosis) fit here because of the anhedonia, low mood, and hallucinations/delusions. But there's also significant psychotic features beyond mood disorders. Alternatively, a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is possible because of persistent delusions and hallucinations. Since they have both depressive and psychotic symptoms, maybe a schizoaffective disorder? But the time frame is 2 weeks, which might not meet the 2-week criteria for schizoaffective unless criteria are met. Alternatively, perhaps considering brief psychotic disorder, but the patient's history isn't clear. The DSM-5 mentions attenuated psychosis syndrome as a potential risk, but that's in the appendix. The symptoms here are active, so maybe MDD with psychotic features is the closest, but the delusions and hallucinations could tip it toward a psychotic disorder. Hmm. Or maybe a psychotic disorder NOS. Also, they mentioned hearing voices and thought broadcast, which are more schizophrenia-like. But the depressive symptoms are prominent too.\n\nWait, in the DSM-5, if the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a major depressive episode, then it's MDD with psychotic features. If the psychosis occurs independently or alongside other symptoms, then schizophrenia might be considered. The patient's description suggests that the depression and psychosis are co-occurring but not clearly linked. Need to check the criteria. Since the patient reported anhedonia, depressed mood, and hallucinations/delusions, MDD with psychotic features is possible. Alternatively, if the psychotic symptoms are not solely due to mood, then schizophrenia. The DSM-5 also has Schizoaffective disorder, but the duration and whether the mood symptoms occur in the absence of psychotic symptoms would need more info. Since the timeframe is two weeks, maybe the current criteria for MDD with psychosis is applicable here. \n\nThe recommended next steps: medical evaluation for organic causes, psychiatric assessment with a specialist, therapy for mood and anxiety, and monitoring for self-harm. Need to mention all these points clearly.\n\nWait, the user's answer also includes somatic symptoms (aches), pains) and distrust in healthcare (Q11). So, need to include a medical workup to rule out issues like neurological issues or substance use. The patient's mention of \"shadows moving\" in Q10 might also be a somatic symptom or part of anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnoses under consideration are **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** or **Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia), pending further evaluation. Since the patient is expressing ongoing psychotic symptoms along with depression, but the duration is only 2 weeks, maybe the diagnosis is still provisional. Alternatively, a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified? The DSM-5 criteria for MDD with psychosis requires that the delusions/hallucinations are directly tied to the depressive episode. If the psychosis is independent, then schizophrenia is more likely. Given the uncertainty, listing both as differential dx.\n\nWait, the DSM-5 has specific criteria. Let me recast: \n\nFor **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: requires MDD criteria plus hallucinations/delusions (e.g., believing others read thoughts, hearing voices, etc.), with symptoms occurring predominantly during depressive episode. \n\nSchizophrenia requires delusions/hallucinations for at least 1 month, so if it's only 2 weeks, maybe a brief psychotic disorder? But the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for two weeks. Alternatively, Atypical Psychosis or Brief Psychotic Disorder, but the duration is exactly two weeks. Alternatively, since the assessment is for the past two weeks, the duration might meet for Brief Psychotic Disorder if it's triggered by stress, but the patient's symptoms seem more persistent. \n\nAlternatively, since the user's questionnaire includes the DSM-5 references in the initial prompt, and the question mentions \"provisional\" consideration, the diagnosis here might lean toward **Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (e.g., schizophreniform disorder)** pending longer follow-up, but since the duration is 2 weeks, maybe acute stress-related psychosis? However, the DSM-5 requires at least 1 month for schizophreniform. So perhaps a diagnosis of **Brief Psychotic Disorder** if stressor is present, but the patient didn't mention a specific trigger. Alternatively, if no clear stressor, then **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)**. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's symptoms might align with **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**, since the depression and psychosis are concurrent, and the duration is 2 weeks. The DSM-5 allows for psychosis in MDD if it's not better explained by another condition. But the delusions like thought broadcasting and paranoia might be more indicative of schizophrenia. \n\nHmm. Given the symptoms described, the primary diagnosis should consider:  \n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> is a possibility if the psychotic symptoms are directly tied to the mood disorder. However, the presence of prominent delusions (thought broadcasting, paranoia) and persistent hallucinations suggests a primary psychotic disorder (<med>Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder</med>). The 2-week timeframe complicates some diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia requires \u22651 month), so a provisional diagnosis of <med>Psychosis Unspecified</med> or <sym>schizophreniform disorder</sym> (if symptoms persist beyond 1 month) could be considered. However, given the data provided, the most accurate clinical impression is likely a **provisional psychotic disorder** with depressive features, pending further evaluation. \n\nWait, but the user's response in Q12 mentions the patient feels the sadness might be induced by voices, suggesting the mood might be secondary. Alternatively, if the patient's depression is primary but with psychosis, that's MDD with psychosis. The delusions about thoughts being broadcast and paranoia could be part of psychotic features. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for MDD with psychotic features require that the delusions/hallucinations are related to the mood. For example, delusions of guilt or unworthiness. But the patient's delusions (thought broadcasting, paranoia) may not be mood-congruent. That would exclude MDD with psychotic features. Hence, the primary diagnosis might instead be a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia spectrum. \n\nSince the duration is two weeks, maybe <med>brief psychotic disorder</med> (if triggered by a stressor not mentioned here). Alternatively, the lack of clear stressor makes it <med>psychotic disorder NOS</med>. \n\nAlternatively, if the patient's symptoms are better explained by schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking?), but since duration is only two weeks, it's too early for schizophrenia. Hence, the provisional diagnosis would be **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)** or **Rule out Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type**. Wait, schizoaffective requires simultaneous mood and psychotic symptoms for a significant duration, but the patient's report is within 2 weeks, which might not meet full criteria yet. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safest provisional diagnosis would be **Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified** pending further evaluation. However, the presence of depressive symptoms complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, since the patient reports \"voices making me feel sad\" (Q3), maybe the psychotic features are not solely mood-congruent. This would move away from MDD with psychosis and toward a primary psychotic disorder. \n\nSo, the diagnosis section should list the possible primary considerations. Maybe list both as differentials but present one as the provisional. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis section could be:  \n**Diagnosis:** <med>Psychosis Unspecified</med> with depressive features, pending further evaluation for <med>SMD with Psychotic Features</med> or <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med>.  \n\nReasoning would explain that the presence of both depressive and psychotic symptoms complicates the diagnosis, and more time is needed. \n\nNow, the next steps would include medical evaluation, psychiatric consultation, therapy, and monitoring. \n\nNow, structuring the sections as per instructions, making sure tags are properly applied, and follow the format strictly. Need to avoid any markdown except the specified tags. Also, make sure the sections are in order: compassionate summary, diagnosis, reasoning, and recommendations. \n\nLet me make sure all symptoms are covered. The patient's responses include auditory hallucinations (Q12), Q13), delusions (thoughts being broadcast), paranoia). Depressive symptoms (Q2, Q3. The anxiety and panic (Q7,8). Also, the self-harm thoughts (Q12. The social withdrawal (Q9. \n\nThe diagnosis needs to reflect the primary issues. Since the psychotic symptoms aren't clearly mood-congruent, the psychotic disorder is primary, but the depression is also present. The diagnosis might be the psychotic disorder with depressive features, but the exact coding might be tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the DSM-5 classification for schizophrenia requires at least one month. Since the patient has had symptoms for two weeks, that's too short for schizophrenia, so maybe a psychotic disorder NOS. \n\nFinalizing the diagnosis as \"Provisional: <med>Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified</med> with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, pending longitudinal evaluation for <med>schiophreniform disorder</med> or <med>mood disorder",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's start by going through the patient's answers step by step. The user provided a detailed conversation between the patient and Dr. Adams, which is part of the DSM-5 Self-Rated Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for adults. My task is to analyze these responses and structure the clinical observations as per the instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms and concerns. Looking at the answers, the patient mentions little interest in activities, feeling down, and hopelessness, which are classic signs of depression. There's also talk of hearing voices and paranoia like feeling thoughts are being broadcast, which points to psychotic symptoms. Anxiety, panic, and avoidance behaviors are present too. Sleep disturbances and unexplained aches and pains are mentioned, which could be somatic symptoms or part of anxiety.\n\nNext, noticing patterns in the responses. The patient frequently references \"voices\" and uncertainty about whether their experiences are real. They mention uncertainty about their symptoms, like questioning if their anger is their own or something else. This could indicate possible delusions or a lack of insight. The pattern of \"I don't know\" or \"maybe\" suggests some ambivalence or confusion, which might be part of their symptomatology.\n\nFor potential clinical areas, the key points would be major depressive disorder with psychotic features, given the combination of low mood and hallucinations. The anxiety and panic symptoms, along with somatic complaints, might point to generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. The avoidance behavior (avoiding the park) could be linked to social anxiety or PTSD. The thought broadcasting and paranoia are definitely psychotic symptoms, which would lean towards a diagnosis like schizophrenia spectrum or schizoaffective disorder. The self-harm thoughts, though infrequent, are still significant risk factors.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include the suicidal ideation mentioned in Q12, even if it's not frequent. The presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions are critical as they can indicate a psychotic disorder. The patient's uncertainty about their symptoms and the impact on daily functioning (like not wanting to go out) are also concerning. The somatic symptoms (aches, pains) might be related to anxiety or could be part of a somatic symptom disorder, but need further evaluation.\n\nNow, to summarize in clinical terms without speculation. Need to make sure I don't assume a diagnosis but list possible areas. Use terms like \"elevated risk,\" \"clinically significant symptoms,\" etc.\n\nWait, in Q13, the patient mentions hearing voices nearly every day. That's a key point for psychotic symptoms. Q14's sleep issues are also severe, occurring nearly every night. The patient's mention of \"voices making me feel sad\" complicates the mood symptoms, suggesting possible depression with psychotic features. The thought of others reading their thoughts (Q14) is a delusion of thought broadcasting. The self-harm thoughts are important but not frequent, so note it as a risk factor but not an active plan. The feeling that illnesses aren't taken seriously (Q10) could indicate poor treatment adherence or distrust in healthcare, affecting treatment effectiveness.\n\nI should structure the summary into the five sections as requested. Make sure each section addresses the points without adding anything beyond what's stated. Avoid terms that suggest a definite diagnosis but highlight the symptoms that align with certain disorders. Also, note inconsistencies or the patient's uncertainty as part of their presentation, which can be relevant for assessing insight.\n\nWait, in Q3, the patient talks about feeling irritable but isn't sure if it's them or \"something else,\" which might indicate possible external locus of control for their symptoms, a common delusion. That's a key point for psychotic disorders. The avoidance of situations (Q9) due to the voices getting louder is important for anxiety and avoidance behavior, possibly agoraphobia or social anxiety.\n\nPutting this all together, the main symptoms are depressive, psychotic, and anxiety symptoms. The patterns show a blend of mood, psychotic, and anxiety features. Clinical areas would include major depressive disorder with psychotic features, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorders, and possible adjustment disorders. Risk factors are the suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms increasing the risk of disorganization, and the distrust in treatment. The summary needs to be concise, using correct terminology like \"auditory hallucinations,\" \"thought insertion/broadcasting,\" \"anhedonia,\" etc. Also, mention the functional impairment due to avoidance and social withdrawal.\n\nI need to make sure not to mention anything not in the responses. For example, the patient didn't report mania, so avoid bipolar unless there's evidence. The energy level question (Q4) mentions sleeping less but having energy, which could be inconsistent, but the patient's explanation is that they can't sleep due to thoughts, not necessarily hypomania. So maybe not a manic episode. So stick to what's given.\n\nAlright, structuring each section now. Let's see:\n\nMain symptoms: anhedonia, depressed mood, hopelessness, auditory hallucinations, delusions (thoughts being broadcast, paranoia about being watched), anxiety, panic, avoidance, somatic symptoms, and self-harm thoughts. \n\nPatterns: reports of external locus of symptoms (voices causing feelings, uncertainty if anger is theirs), cyclical or daily occurrence of some symptoms (voices every day, anxiety almost daily), and functional impairment (avoiding places, social withdrawal).\n\nClinical significance: depressive symptoms with psychotic features (e.g., major depressive disorder with psychotic features), possible schizophrenia spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and adjustment issues. The somatic symptoms might be secondary to anxiety or require medical evaluation.\n\nRisk factors: suicidal ideation (though not active plan), psychotic symptoms indicating possible disorganized behavior, possible treatment non-adherence due to distrust in healthcare providers, and social withdrawal affecting daily functioning.\n\nPutting this all into the required sections concisely, using clinical terms and sticking to the data. Need to avoid saying \"diagnosis\" but note areas for further assessment. Ensure all key points from the answers are included, like the voices, delusions, sleep issues, etc.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Depressive symptoms**: Anhedonia (Q2), persistent low mood, and hopelessness (Q3).  \n- **Psychotic features**: Auditory hallucinations (voices commenting on actions, Q12), delusions (thoughts broadcasted, paranoia about being watched [Q7, Q13]), and uncertainty regarding symptom origin (Q3, Q12).  \n- **Anxiety/Panic**: Persistent nervousness, panic attacks (Q7, Q8), and somatic symptoms (Q10).  \n- **Functional impairment**: Social withdrawal (Q9), disrupted sleep (Q5, Q14), and poor treatment engagement (Q11.  \n\n**2. Response Patterns:**  \n- **Uncertainty/dissociation**: Frequent hedging (\u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d), suggesting possible confusion about symptom ownership (e.g., attributing irritability to an external source [Q3], questioning if sadness is self-generated [Q3].  \n- **Consistency of psychotic experiences**: Auditory hallucinations and delusions occur nearly daily (Q12, Q13), but patient expresses shame/anxiety when disclosing (Q12, Q13).  \n- **Cyclical symptom severity**: Fluctuations in mood, anxiety, and panic (Q2, Q7, Q8), with environmental triggers (e.g., voices intensifying in public [Q9].  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Areas for Further Assessment:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** (elevated by persistent anhedonia, hopelessness, and hallucinations/delusions).  \n- **Psychotic Disorder (e.g., schizophrenia spectrum)**: Persecutory ideation, thought broadcast, and persistent hallucinations.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety/Panic Disorder**: Persistent anxiety, panic attacks, and somatic symptoms (Q6, Q7, Q10.  \n- **Trauma- or stressor-related symptoms**: Avoidance behaviors (Q9), though trauma history not explicitly stated.  \n- **Substance use/other medical conditions**: Not mentioned, but somatic symptoms (Q10) warrant medical evaluation to rule out organic causes.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Self-harm ideation** (Q12): Infrequent but notable; requires assessment of intent, plan, and protective factors.  \n- **Poor insight**: Patient questions symptom reality (Q3, Q12), which may impede treatment engagement.  \n- **Social withdrawal and isolation**: Avoidance of public spaces (Q9), impacting daily functioning.  \n- **Treatment skepticism** (Q11): Distrust in healthcare providers may lead to medication nonadherence.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **clinically significant depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood)**, **psychotic features (auditory hallucinations, delusions of thought broadcast and paranoia)**, and **generalized anxiety/panic**. Symptoms appear chronic (\u22652 weeks) and impair social/family functioning. Psychotic content (voices, paranoia) and poor insight suggest a need for differential diagnosis between depressive psychosis, schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or other psychotic disorders. Anxiety exacerbates somatic symptoms (aches, poor sleep) and avoidance behaviors. **Suicidal ideation without plan** and **medication adherence concerns** require urgent evaluation. Further assessment is warranted to clarify axis I diagnoses, assess for trauma, and evaluate medical/neurological contributors to symptoms. Risk of decompensation without targeted intervention is elevated due to poor insight and social withdrawal.  \n\n**Key Clinical Priorities:**  \n- Rule out organic etiologies (e.g., neurological, metabolic) for psychotic symptoms.  \n- Assess suicide risk (ideation, intent, protective factors).  \n- Evaluate insight and treatment engagement barriers (Q",

The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features (MDD w/ Psychosis) fit here because of the anhedonia, low mood, and hallucinations/delusions. But there's also significant psychotic features beyond mood disorders. Alternatively, a schizophrenia spectrum disorder is possible because of persistent delusions and hallucinations. Since they have both depressive and psychotic symptoms, maybe a schizoaffective disorder? But the time frame is 2 weeks, which might not meet the 2-week criteria for schizoaffective unless criteria are met. Alternatively, perhaps considering brief psychotic disorder, but the patient's history isn't clear. The DSM-5 mentions attenuated psychosis syndrome as a potential risk, but that's in the appendix. The symptoms here are active, so maybe MDD with psychotic features is the closest, but the delusions and hallucinations could tip it toward a psychotic disorder. Hmm. Or maybe a psychotic disorder NOS. Also, they mentioned hearing voices and thought broadcast, which are more schizophrenia-like. But the depressive symptoms are prominent too.\n\nWait, in the DSM-5, if the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a major depressive episode, then it's MDD with psychotic features. If the psychosis occurs independently or alongside other symptoms, then schizophrenia might be considered. The patient's description suggests that the depression and psychosis are co-occurring but not clearly linked. Need to check the criteria. Since the patient reported anhedonia, depressed mood, and hallucinations/delusions, MDD with psychotic features is possible. Alternatively, if the psychotic symptoms are not solely due to mood, then schizophrenia. The DSM-5 also has Schizoaffective disorder, but the duration and whether the mood symptoms occur in the absence of psychotic symptoms would need more info. Since the timeframe is two weeks, maybe the current criteria for MDD with psychosis is applicable here. \n\nThe recommended next steps: medical evaluation for organic causes, psychiatric assessment with a specialist, therapy for mood and anxiety, and monitoring for self-harm. Need to mention all these points clearly.\n\nWait, the user's answer also includes somatic symptoms (aches), pains) and distrust in healthcare (Q11). So, need to include a medical workup to rule out issues like neurological issues or substance use. The patient's mention of \"shadows moving\" in Q10 might also be a somatic symptom or part of anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnoses under consideration are **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features** or **Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia), pending further evaluation. Since the patient is expressing ongoing psychotic symptoms along with depression, but the duration is only 2 weeks, maybe the diagnosis is still provisional. Alternatively, a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified? The DSM-5 criteria for MDD with psychosis requires that the delusions/hallucinations are directly tied to the depressive episode. If the psychosis is independent, then schizophrenia is more likely. Given the uncertainty, listing both as differential dx.\n\nWait, the DSM-5 has specific criteria. Let me recast: \n\nFor **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: requires MDD criteria plus hallucinations/delusions (e.g., believing others read thoughts, hearing voices, etc.), with symptoms occurring predominantly during depressive episode. \n\nSchizophrenia requires delusions/hallucinations for at least 1 month, so if it's only 2 weeks, maybe a brief psychotic disorder? But the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for two weeks. Alternatively, Atypical Psychosis or Brief Psychotic Disorder, but the duration is exactly two weeks. Alternatively, since the assessment is for the past two weeks, the duration might meet for Brief Psychotic Disorder if it's triggered by stress, but the patient's symptoms seem more persistent. \n\nAlternatively, since the user's questionnaire includes the DSM-5 references in the initial prompt, and the question mentions \"provisional\" consideration, the diagnosis here might lean toward **Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (e.g., schizophreniform disorder)** pending longer follow-up, but since the duration is 2 weeks, maybe acute stress-related psychosis? However, the DSM-5 requires at least 1 month for schizophreniform. So perhaps a diagnosis of **Brief Psychotic Disorder** if stressor is present, but the patient didn't mention a specific trigger. Alternatively, if no clear stressor, then **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)**. \n\nAlternatively, the patient's symptoms might align with **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**, since the depression and psychosis are concurrent, and the duration is 2 weeks. The DSM-5 allows for psychosis in MDD if it's not better explained by another condition. But the delusions like thought broadcasting and paranoia might be more indicative of schizophrenia. \n\nHmm. Given the symptoms described, the primary diagnosis should consider:  \n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> is a possibility if the psychotic symptoms are directly tied to the mood disorder. However, the presence of prominent delusions (thought broadcasting, paranoia) and persistent hallucinations suggests a primary psychotic disorder (<med>Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder</med>). The 2-week timeframe complicates some diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia requires \u22651 month), so a provisional diagnosis of <med>Psychosis Unspecified</med> or <sym>schizophreniform disorder</sym> (if symptoms persist beyond 1 month) could be considered. However, given the data provided, the most accurate clinical impression is likely a **provisional psychotic disorder** with depressive features, pending further evaluation. \n\nWait, but the user's response in Q12 mentions the patient feels the sadness might be induced by voices, suggesting the mood might be secondary. Alternatively, if the patient's depression is primary but with psychosis, that's MDD with psychosis. The delusions about thoughts being broadcast and paranoia could be part of psychotic features. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for MDD with psychotic features require that the delusions/hallucinations are related to the mood. For example, delusions of guilt or unworthiness. But the patient's delusions (thought broadcasting, paranoia) may not be mood-congruent. That would exclude MDD with psychotic features. Hence, the primary diagnosis might instead be a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia spectrum. \n\nSince the duration is two weeks, maybe <med>brief psychotic disorder</med> (if triggered by a stressor not mentioned here). Alternatively, the lack of clear stressor makes it <med>psychotic disorder NOS</med>. \n\nAlternatively, if the patient's symptoms are better explained by schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking?), but since duration is only two weeks, it's too early for schizophrenia. Hence, the provisional diagnosis would be **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)** or **Rule out Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type**. Wait, schizoaffective requires simultaneous mood and psychotic symptoms for a significant duration, but the patient's report is within 2 weeks, which might not meet full criteria yet. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safest provisional diagnosis would be **Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified** pending further evaluation. However, the presence of depressive symptoms complicates this. \n\nAlternatively, since the patient reports \"voices making me feel sad\" (Q3), maybe the psychotic features are not solely mood-congruent. This would move away from MDD with psychosis and toward a primary psychotic disorder. \n\nSo, the diagnosis section should list the possible primary considerations. Maybe list both as differentials but present one as the provisional. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis section could be:  \n**Diagnosis:** <med>Psychosis Unspecified</med> with depressive features, pending further evaluation for <med>SMD with Psychotic Features</med> or <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med>.  \n\nReasoning would explain that the presence of both depressive and psychotic symptoms complicates the diagnosis, and more time is needed. \n\nNow, the next steps would include medical evaluation, psychiatric consultation, therapy, and monitoring. \n\nNow, structuring the sections as per instructions, making sure tags are properly applied, and follow the format strictly. Need to avoid any markdown except the specified tags. Also, make sure the sections are in order: compassionate summary, diagnosis, reasoning, and recommendations. \n\nLet me make sure all symptoms are covered. The patient's responses include auditory hallucinations (Q12), Q13), delusions (thoughts being broadcast), paranoia). Depressive symptoms (Q2, Q3. The anxiety and panic (Q7,8). Also, the self-harm thoughts (Q12. The social withdrawal (Q9. \n\nThe diagnosis needs to reflect the primary issues. Since the psychotic symptoms aren't clearly mood-congruent, the psychotic disorder is primary, but the depression is also present. The diagnosis might be the psychotic disorder with depressive features, but the exact coding might be tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the DSM-5 classification for schizophrenia requires at least one month. Since the patient has had symptoms for two weeks, that's too short for schizophrenia, so maybe a psychotic disorder NOS. \n\nFinalizing the diagnosis as \"Provisional: <med>Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified</med> with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, pending longitudinal evaluation for <med>schiophreniform disorder</med> or <med>mood disorder",
