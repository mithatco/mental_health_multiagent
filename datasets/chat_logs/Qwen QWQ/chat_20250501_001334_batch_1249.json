      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's start by processing the user's responses. The patient reported frequent panic attacks, avoidance of certain situations, and sleep issues. They mentioned panic attacks happening three times a week, which is significant. The chest tightness and muscle tension are somatic symptoms linked to anxiety. The DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder require recurrent, unexpected panic attacks plus at least one month of persistent concern about the attacks or their consequences. The patient's avoidance of places (like public transport) aligns with agoraphobia. They also mentioned feeling dismissed by doctors, which might relate to their anxiety about health. \n\nThe key here is to differentiate between panic disorder and something like GAD or PTSD. The panic attacks and avoidance strongly point to panic disorder, especially with the agoraphobic avoidance. The DSM-5 also notes that for panic disorder, the anxiety is about the attacks themselves, not other fears like in specific phobia.\n\nThe user's answers don't mention trauma exposure, so PTSD is less likely. Somatic Symptom Disorder is mentioned in the reference, but here the somatic symptoms (chest pain, muscle tension) are better explained by the anxiety, so that's not primary. The patient's functional impairment (avoiding work, hobbies) supports the panic disorder diagnosis. The recommended next steps should focus on CBT for panic, possibly SSRIs, and addressing their concerns about medical care. Need to make sure to structure the response exactly as per the instructions, with the right tags and sections. Also, ensure to avoid mentioning Somatic Symptom Disorder since the symptoms are explained by another condition. The key is panic disorder with agoraphobia, and maybe GAD as a comorbid condition. But based on the symptoms listed, panic disorder is the primary diagnosis. Let me structure each section properly now.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are central themes in your experience.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a series of patient responses to a DSM-5 questionnaire. My job is to analyze these responses and structure the findings according to the specified points: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a summary.\n\nFirst, I need to read through all the questions and answers again to get a clear picture. The patient is clearly dealing with significant anxiety, especially panic attacks. They mentioned avoiding situations because of anxiety, which is a big red flag for panic disorder or maybe agoraphobia. The frequent panic attacks (3 times a week) are a key point here.\n\nLooking at question 2 about feeling depressed, the patient says it's more anxiety-driven rather than pure depression, but there's still a low mood component. That's important because it could indicate comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms, though the primary issue seems to be anxiety.\n\nThe person mentioned irritability (question 3) and sleep disturbance (question 4). The insomnia and exhaustion tie into chronic anxiety, which is common. They aren't hypomanic since they're not having increased energy but rather the opposite. The aches and pains (question 10) are probably somatic symptoms of anxiety, which is typical. The patient also feels their issues aren't taken seriously (question 11), which could point to a sense of invalidation or maybe contributing to their anxiety.\n\nNow, for the main symptoms: panic attacks, anxiety, avoidance behavior, sleep issues, irritability, somatic symptoms. The patterns here are the prominence of anxiety over depression, the cyclical nature of panic leading to avoidance and worsening symptoms. The clinical significance areas would be panic disorder with possible agoraphobia, adjustment to chronic anxiety, possible comorbid depression, and somatic symptoms. Risk factors include high frequency of panic attacks, avoidance leading to social impairment, and the feeling of being dismissed, which might affect treatment adherence or trust in medical professionals.\n\nWait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The patient's answer to question 1 mentions pulling back from activities due to anxiety about panic attacks. That's part of the avoidance, which is a big part of panic disorder. The chest pains and muscle tension are physical manifestations. Also, the irritability and sleep issues are common in anxiety disorders. The feeling that their symptoms aren't taken seriously could indicate a need for validation and effective communication with healthcare providers.\n\nI need to structure this into the required sections. Make sure not to add anything not in the responses. Avoid speculation, so stick to what's directly stated. The summary should use clinical terms like panic disorder, avoidance behavior, somatic symptoms, etc. Also, note the risk factors like functional impairment from avoidance and possible social withdrawal.\n\nLet me check each point again. The main symptoms: the key points from each question. Patterns: the interplay between panic attacks and avoidance, the physical symptoms linked to anxiety, and the emotional responses like irritability. Clinical areas: definitely panic disorder, possible agoraphobia, adjustment issues. Risk factors include the high frequency of panic attacks, which can escalate, and the avoidance leading to reduced functioning. The distrust in medical providers might complicate treatment.\n\nI think that's all. Now, organizing this into the required sections without fluff. Keep it concise, professional, and evidence-based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Panic attacks** (3 episodes/week; acute autonomic arousal: palpitations, dyspnea, fear of losing control).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms**: Persistent nervousness, hypervigilance, and anticipatory anxiety.  \n- **Avoidance behavior**: Social, occupational, and environmental restriction (e.g., avoiding public transport, crowded areas).  \n- **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia due to rumination/worry, leading to fatigue.  \n- **Somatic symptoms**: Chest tightness, muscle tension (interpreted as anxiety-related).  \n- **Emotional dysregulation**: Irritability, frustration, and perceived invalidation by healthcare providers.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Primary focus on anxiety over depressive symptoms**, with low mood described as secondary to anxiety.  \n- **Cycle of panic attacks \u2192 avoidance \u2192 functional impairment** (e.g., withdrawal from work/hobbies).  \n- **Hyperawareness of physical sensations** (e.g., chest pain) with health anxiety despite medical reassurance.  \n- **Self-awareness of symptomatology** (e.g., recognizing irritability as \"not [their] usual self\").  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia**: Frequent panic attacks + avoidance of settings perceived as unsafe.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Chronic anxiety and restlessness.  \n- **Health Anxiety**: Exaggerated concern about physical symptoms despite medical evaluation.  \n- **Social/role impairment**: Reduced engagement in occupational and recreational activities.  \n- **Risk of comorbid depression**: Subthreshold depressive symptoms noted (e.g., \"feeling low\").  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **High frequency of panic episodes** (3/week) with escalating somatic preoccupation.  \n- **Avoidance behavior exacerbating functional decline** (e.g., withdrawal from essential activities).  \n- **Perceived invalidation by medical professionals**: May reduce treatment engagement or trust.  \n- **Lack of adaptive coping strategies** (e.g., no mention of grounding techniques or support systems).  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with prominent **panic disorder features** (recurrent panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic avoidance), consistent with DSM-5 criteria. Secondary symptoms include **generalized anxiety**, sleep disturbance, and mild irritability. Somatic complaints (chest tightness, muscle tension) are likely anxiety-mediated, with health anxiety complicating symptom interpretation. The patient reports social/occupational impairment due to avoidance behaviors and functional withdrawal. Perceived dismissive medical interactions may necessitate addressing trust and collaboration in care. While depressive symptoms are subthreshold, ongoing monitoring for mood worsening is warranted. Prioritization of anxiolytic strategies (e.g., CBT for panic, interoceptive exposure) and validation of subjective distress are clinically indicated.  \n\n---  \nThis summary synthesizes the patient\u2019s reported experiences without speculative interpretation, emphasizing panic disorder, avoidance, and functional impairment as core foci.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are central themes in your experience. It sounds incredibly isolating to feel trapped by <sym> chest tightness</sym>, social withdrawal, and <sym>distrust in medical systems</sym>. Your description of <quote>\"lying awake worrying\"</quote> and <quote>\"terrified of having an attack in a place I can't escape\"</quote> highlights both the physical toll and profound emotional burden you\u2019re carrying. You deserve validation for the courage it takes to face these challenges daily.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, likely with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  \n**Reasoning:**  \n1. <med>Panic Disorder</med> criteria are met via recurrent, unexpected <sym>panic attacks</sym> (3/week), autonomic arousal (tachycardia, dyspnea), and persistent fear of further attacks.  \n2. <med>Agoraphobia</med> is confirmed by avoidance of public places due to fear of <sym>helplessness during panic</sym>.  \n3. <sym>Chronic anxiety</sym> about health/safety (<quote>\"I still worry though\"</quote>) and excessive worry about multiple outcomes (e.g., fainting, heart attack) align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.  \n4. <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> like chest tightness are better explained by panic-related hypervigilance than <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, as there\u2019s no disproportionate focus on illness despite health-related anxiety.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Panic-focused <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>**: Address maladaptive thought patterns and avoidance behaviors (e.g., interoceptive exposure for panic attacks).  \n2. **SSRI medication trial** (e.g., escitalopram) to reduce panic frequency and severity.  \n3. <med>Psychoeducation</med> on panic neurophysiology to reduce catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily sensations.  \n4. Collaborative care with a primary care provider to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (e.g., CBT-I for insomnia).  \n5. Referral to a <med>biofeedback</med> specialist to manage muscle tension and autonomic arousal.  \n6. Address unmet needs around validation by ensuring your healthcare team acknowledges your distress without pathologizing your concerns.  \n7. Monitor for <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> given social withdrawal, but prioritize anxiety treatment first.  \n\nAll recommendations align with DSM-5 criteria and evidence-based guidelines for anxiety spectrum disorders.",
