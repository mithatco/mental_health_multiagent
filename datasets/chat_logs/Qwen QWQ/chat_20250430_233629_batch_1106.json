      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to process the user's query properly. They provided a detailed scenario where the patient answered a series of mental health questions. The user wants a structured assessment following specific formatting and tags. Let me start by reviewing the patient's responses again.\n\nThe patient is a recently divorced adult showing signs of depression and anxiety. They mentioned loss of interest, feeling down, irritability, sleep issues, anxiety, panic episodes, somatic symptoms, and social withdrawal. They also mentioned feeling like a burden but denied active suicidal intent. No psychotic symptoms. \n\nFirst, the compassionate summary needs to encapsulate their situation. They\u2019re struggling with divorce, feeling stuck emotionally, and dealing with physical and mental distress. I should mention their resilience in seeking help.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The main contenders are Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and Adjustment Disorder with mixed features. Since their symptoms started after the divorce and are within 2 weeks, Adjustment Disorder might be primary. MDD is possible if the criteria are met (5+ symptoms for at least two weeks). The patient has multiple depressive symptoms but might need more to confirm MDD. However, the stressor (divorce) points to Adjustment Disorder, but the depth of symptoms might overlap with MDD. The DSM-5 criteria for Adjustment Disorder require that the symptoms are in response to an identifiable stressor (the divorce) and are excessive or prolonged. The patient's somatic symptoms (headaches, GI issues) could be linked to stress, but Somatic Symptom Disorder might not fit unless symptoms are disproportionate. However, since the somatic symptoms are tied to stress, they might be better under Adjustment Disorder. The panic attacks are mild (only a few instances), so maybe not Panic Disorder. \n\nThe user emphasized not to default to SSD unless clearly warranted. So, considering the timing and stressor, Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood seems most accurate. \n\nIn the reasoning section, I need to justify why Adjustment Disorder is chosen over MDD. The onset is closely tied to the divorce, and the symptoms are within the timeframe of the stressor. However, the severity and duration (only 2 weeks) might not yet meet full MDD criteria, but if they meet at least 5 symptoms, maybe MDD with adjustment disorder feature. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe both Adjustment Disorder and GAD could be co-occurring. \n\nWait, the DSM allows for multiple diagnoses. The patient has both depressive and anxious symptoms. They\u2019ve had symptoms for a month since divorce, so more than two weeks. The duration for Adjustment Disorder can be up to six months, so that's okay. But MDD criteria require at least two weeks with 5 symptoms. Let me count: depressed mood (Q3), anhedonia (Q2), sleep disturbance (Q5?), fatigue (Q4? Wait Q4's response was about not having energy despite sleeping. Let me check the answers again.\n\nLooking at the responses again: \n\nQ2: Little interest/pleasure: yes (anhedonia).  \nQ3: Feeling down, hopeless: yes (depressed mood.  \nQ4: Irritability: yes (symptom.  \nQ5: Sleep: Q4 was about energy, but Q5 was about starting projects, which they didn't. Energy is low.  \nQ6: Anxiousness: yes.  \nQ7: Panic attacks (yes).  \nQ8: Avoidance: yes.  \nQ9: Somatic symptoms.  \nQ10: Feeling illnesses not taken seriously.  \n\nThe patient has multiple depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep issues, fatigue/energy changes, possible worthlessness (feeling like a burden), but not the DSM depression criteria. Wait, the DSM-5 requires 5 symptoms for MDD in 2 weeks. Let me count again. The patient's answers for MDD symptoms:  \n1. Anhedonia (Q2).  \n2. Depressed mood (Q3.  \n3. Sleep disturbance (Q5 sleep issues.  \n4. Irritability (Q4.  \n5. Fatigue/low energy (Q5 says \"exhausted\", plus \"sleeping 10 hours but still tired\".  \n6. Possible diminished concentration (avoiding decisions like unpacking).  \n7. Worthlessness/guilt (implied by \"I should get over it\" self-criticism.  \nThat might meet the 5+ symptoms for MDD. The onset is within the last month, but the DSM requires 2 weeks. Since the divorce was finalized a month ago, the symptoms have been present for at least 2 weeks. The patient mentions feeling this way \"most days.\" \n\nSo maybe a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Mild to Moderate, with Adjustment Disorder as a contributing factor. Alternatively, the Adjustment Disorder might be the primary stressor-linked issue. \n\nAlternatively, the anxiety symptoms (GAD) are also prominent. The panic attack-like symptoms (Q7) might be panic attacks but not meeting full Panic Disorder. \n\nThe key is whether the stressor (divorce) is the primary trigger. Since the symptoms started after the divorce and are exacerbated by it, Adjustment Disorder is likely. But if the symptoms now meet full MDD criteria, they can have both. \n\nThe patient also mentions that the somatic symptoms are \"unexplained\" and distressing, so Somatic Symptom Disorder is a consideration. But since the somatic symptoms are tied to the stressor (divorce), it's better explained by Adjustment Disorder. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis would be Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. It's also possible to code an anxiety disorder (GAD) and depressive symptoms as co-occurring, but the adjustment disorder is the organizing diagnosis here.\n\n**Final diagnosis:** Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, with possible comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and somatic symptoms secondary to stress.\n\nNow, structuring the response as per the user's instructions. Must use the required tags and formatting. Let me ensure each section is properly tagged and the structure is exact.\n\nMake sure to tag terms like \"Adjustment Disorder\" as <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>, symptoms like <sym>irritability</sym>, and quotes from the patient.\n\nAlso, the user emphasized not defaulting to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clear. Since symptoms are linked to stress, SSD might not be primary here.\n\nAlright, putting it all into the required structure now.\n</think>\n\n<personality=\"empathetic and analytical\" style=\"formal clinical report with empathy\">\n\n**Compassionate Summary:**  \nYou\u2019ve described a profound sense of emptiness since your divorce, <sym>feeling flat</sym> and disconnected from activities that once brought joy.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed set of responses from a patient to the DSM-5 self-assessment. My job is to analyze these and structure the information as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to read through all the questions and answers carefully. The patient is a divorced adult dealing with significant emotional distress following a recent divorce. The responses indicate several symptoms.\n\nStarting with the first part: identifying main symptoms and concerns. The patient mentions anhedonia (lack of interest in hobbies), depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances (insomnia but then oversleeping), anxiety, physical symptoms (aches and pains), social withdrawal, and low self-esteem (feeling like a burden). \n\nNext, looking for patterns. The divorce seems to be a major stressor triggering these symptoms. The symptoms have been present for at least two weeks as per the questionnaire's timeframe. There's a consistent theme of emotional numbness and avoidance, which could indicate a stress response or adjustment disorder.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance: Major Depressive Disorder comes to mind, especially considering the duration and the symptoms listed. Also, Generalized Anxiety Disorder given the constant worry and panic episodes. The physical complaints like headaches and stomach issues could be somatic symptoms related to stress. The social withdrawal and avoiding the park with the sister suggests possible social anxiety or worsening of adjustment issues. The thought of being a burden is a red flag, though the patient denies suicidal intent. Need to check if they meet criteria for any specific disorders.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs: The mention of feeling like a burden is a concern, even if they deny active suicidal thoughts. The recent life event (divorce) is a major stressor. The irritability could indicate possible dysphoric mania, but their energy levels don't support that. The panic attacks (question 8's situation with the bill) might be panic disorder, but it's only a few instances. The main risk here is the depressive symptoms and possible adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n\nNow, summarizing in clinical terms. Need to structure each section as per the user's request. Make sure to use DSM-5 terms where applicable. Avoid speculation, just the facts from the responses.\n\nWait, the patient didn't report increased energy, so bipolar is less likely. The sleep issue is more insomnia with hypersomnia, which is common in depression. The anxiety symptoms are high, so GAD is a fit. The physical symptoms are somatic. The avoidance of social situations indicates possible anxiety or adjustment. The key points are the depressive symptoms, anxiety, recent stressor, and the risk factor (feeling a burden). Need to note the lack of suicidal intent but the presence of that thought.\n\nOkay, organizing all that into the required sections. Make sure each point is based directly on their answers without adding anything inferred. For example, the \"feeling like a burden\" is a risk factor even without active intent. Also, the panic attacks are mentioned as a few instances. \n\nDouble-checking each question's response to ensure I didn't miss anything. The patient didn't report any psychotic symptoms (question 12 says no voices). So no psychosis there. The main areas are depression, anxiety, adjustment, and somatic symptoms. \n\nAlright, structure the summary with each numbered section as per the user's instructions, using clinical terms like anhedonia, depressed mood, etc. Keep it concise but comprehensive. Highlight the key points in each section. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Depressed mood:** Persistent feelings of flatness, hopelessness, and emotional heaviness, exacerbated by recent divorce.  \n- **Anhedonia:** Marked reduction in interest/pleasure in activities (e.g., abandoned hobbies).  \n- **Anxiety symptoms:** Restlessness, nervousness, and somatic symptoms (e.g., trembling, gastrointestinal distress).  \n- **Psychomotor agitation/retardation:** Difficulty initiating tasks (e.g., unpacking boxes), combined with restlessness (e.g., \"can\u2019t sit still\").  \n- **Irritability:** Exacerbated by minor stressors (e.g., snapping at children), followed by guilt.  \n- **Sleep disturbance:** Insomnia with initial sleep-onset difficulty and hypersomnia (prolonged sleep but unrefreshing).  \n- **Somatic symptoms:** Headaches, gastrointestinal issues linked to stress.  \n- **Social withdrawal:** Avoidance of previously valued social activities (e.g., avoiding sister\u2019s park outings.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms cluster around recent life stressor (divorce finalization), suggesting an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  \n- Persistent self-criticism (\"overreacting,\" \"should just get over it\") and low self-efficacy.  \n- Elevated anxiety and somatic symptoms correlate with reminders of marital issues (e.g., bills triggering panic).  \n- Mixed vegetative symptoms (fatigue vs. agitation) and ambivalence about seeking help (\"I guess I can try\" vs. \"I don\u2019t push it\").  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Areas of Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Criteria met for depressed mood, anhedonia, psychomotor changes, fatigue, and guilt (via irritability and self-blame).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive anxiety about managing life independently, coupled with somatic symptoms and hyperarousal (restlessness, tremors).  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Anxious and Depressed Mixed Disturbance:** Symptoms emerged within one month of divorce and interfere with social function (e.g., withdrawal from family).  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Somatic complaints (headaches, GI distress) disproportionately distressing and exacerbated by psychological stress.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Suicidal ideation risk:** Acknowledgment of \"feeling like a burden\" (passive ideation) without intent/plans. No active risk but requires monitoring.  \n- **Social isolation:** Avoidant behavior linked to anxiety, risking further emotional deterioration.  \n- **Chronic stressor:** Prolonged marital dissolution and role transition (e.g., post-divorce adjustment) as a sustained stressor.  \n- **Cognitive distortions:** Self-blame (\"I should just get over it\") and underreporting of symptoms (e.g., dismissing physical pain as trivial).  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with clinically significant depressive and anxious symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disruption) and somatic complaints (headaches, GI distress), consistent with an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, likely exacerbated by recent divorce. Anxiety symptoms meet GAD thresholds, with panic-like episodes (sudden autonomic arousal triggered by stressors like financial reminders). Somatic symptoms align with stress-related physiological responses. While no acute suicidal intent is reported, passive suicidal ideation (\"burden\" thoughts) warrants monitoring. Risk of functional decline due to social withdrawal and poor self-care is notable. Further assessment of grief, coping mechanisms, and social support is indicated to differentiate adjustment disorder from persistent MDD. Rule out thyroid dysfunction or other medical causes for somatic symptoms.",

The <sym>irritability</sym> you\u2019ve noticed in yourself feels out of character, and your <sym>aches</sym> and panic-like moments tie directly to the emotional upheaval of recent life changes. It sounds overwhelming to navigate this alone, especially since you\u2019re trying to \"just get over it\" while carrying so much weight. I want you to know that your pain is valid, and you don\u2019t have to manage this without support.  \n\n<diag>  \n<med>Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood</med> with <sym>clinically significant somatic symptoms</sym> tied to acute stressor.  \n\n<reasoning>  \n- **Adjustment Disorder:** Symptoms emerged within 1 month of divorce (stressor), with <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> persisting over 2 weeks. These align with DSM-5 criteria for stressor-driven distress greater than expected.  \n- **Anxiety features:** <sym>Panic-like episodes</sym> (e.g., racing heart when reminded of bills) and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (e.g., ruminating on \"what if I can\u2019t manage this alone?\"). This aligns with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> traits but may fall under the adjustment disorder\u2019s anxiety component.  \n- **Somatic symptoms:** <sym>GI distress</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym> are stress-mediated, not disproportionate to medical findings (no mention of seeking excessive medical care, ruling out <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>).  \n- **Suicidal ideation:** <sym>Passive suicidal thoughts</sym> (\"feeling like a burden\") require monitoring but do not yet meet criteria for major depression with suicidal intent.  \n\n<next_steps>  \n1. **Psychotherapy prioritization:**  \n   - Recommend <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address maladaptive coping (e.g., \"I should just get over it\") and stress management.  \n   - Family therapy if <sym>interpersonal strain</sym> with children or ex-partner is impacting mood.  \n\n2. **Medical workup:**  \n   - Rule out <med>hypothyroidism</med> or <med>anxiety-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction</med> via primary care.  \n\n3. **Medication review:**  \n   - If <sym>anxiety</sym> or insomnia persist, low-dose <med>SNRI</med> (e.g., venlafaxine) or <med>SSRI</med> (e.g., escitalopram) could be considered after ruling out medical causes.  \n\n4. **Support systems:**  \n   - Encourage reengaging with your sister or a support group to counter <sym>isolation</sym>.  \n\n5. **Suicidal risk monitoring:**  \n   - Weekly mood checks for shifts in <sym>hopelessness</sym> or <sym>self-worth</sym",
