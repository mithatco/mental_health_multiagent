The patient is going through a tough time after a divorce, showing symptoms like anhedonia and hopelessness. I should acknowledge their distress and the impact on their life.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The main points here are the depressive symptoms: anhedonia for two weeks, depressed mood, sleep issues, and suicidal thoughts. The anxiety component with avoidance and panic sensations. The divorce is a recent stressor, so maybe adjustment disorder is part of it, but the symptoms align more with MDD since they meet duration and symptom criteria. The DSM-5 criteria for MDD require at least two weeks and five symptoms. Let's count:  \n- Anhedonia (Q1)  \n- Depressed mood (Q2)  \n- Insomnia (Q14)  \n- Fatigue (Q4)  \n- Psychomotor agitation isn't present, but psychomotor retardation (slowed thinking) from depression could fit.  \n- Suicidal ideation (Q11)  \n- Irritability (Q3) is also a depressive symptom.  \nThat's five symptoms, so MDD is likely. The anxiety features (Q6, Q7, Q8) could be part of anxious distress specifier for MDD. \n\nAvoiding adjustment disorder because the duration is two weeks, which is within the adjustment disorder timeframe, but MDD also fits. Since the symptoms meet MDD criteria, it's better to prioritize that. \n\nThe somatic symptoms (Q9, Q15) are likely secondary. No psychosis. Suicidal ideation is a key concern. \n\nNext Steps: Address MDD, manage anxiety, ensure safety, and support with therapy. \n\nWait, the user said not to default to somatic symptom disorder, which the patient doesn't meet because they don't have excessive thoughts about illness. \n\nPutting it all together: Diagnosis should be Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress. Maybe also note adjustment disorder as a secondary consideration, but primary is MDD. \n\nFor next steps: Safety assessment, psychotherapy (CBT), meds like SSRIs, etc. \n\nI need to structure the Diagnosis section precisely. The key is to align all symptoms to the diagnosis. Also, including the adjustment disorder as a possible comorbid consideration? Or just primary MDD?\n\nYes, the primary diagnosis is MDD with anxious distress specifiers. The adjustment disorder could be a contributing factor but not the main diagnosis. \n\nI think that's the way to go. Now, structure the sections accordingly, using the correct tags and formatting. Make sure to use the medical terms and quote the patient's answers where relevant. Also, ensure the next steps are actionable.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Hopelessness</sym> and <sym>physical discomfort</sym> dominate your experience since your divorce.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to go through each of the patient's answers and note the key points. The user wants me to identify main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risk factors, and summarize in clinical terms. \n\nStarting with question 1: The patient reports anhedonia, which is loss of interest/pleasure. They mention feeling numb, which is a key red flag. That's a classic symptom of depression. \n\nQ2: They feel down/depressed/ hopeless, especially after the divorce, about 4 days a week. The divorce is a significant stressor here. So that's a major life event contributing to their mood. \n\nQ3: Irritability and anger, occurring several days a week. This could be part of an anxiety or depressive disorder or maybe adjustment disorder.\n\nQ4: Sleep disturbance\u2014insomnia with fatigue. That's common in depression; they might have a non-restorative sleep pattern.\n\nQ5: No increased activity or risk-taking. The patient is the opposite, withdrawn. So that rules out hypomania or mania, which is important.\n\nQ6: Anxiety symptoms, nervousness, worry. The racing thoughts and background worry suggest generalized anxiety.\n\nQ7: Panic symptoms, though not full attacks, but still some fear episodes. That's subclinical panic, but still notable.\n\nQ8: Avoidance of social situations due to anxiety. This might point towards social anxiety or adjustment disorder, but the avoidance is increasing, so maybe a phobia or PTSD? Wait, but the divorce is a recent stressor, so adjustment disorder is possible.\n\nQ9: Somatic symptoms like headaches and back pain without physical cause. That's somatization, stress-related. \n\nQ10: Feeling that their symptoms are dismissed. This could lead to non-adherence or distrust in treatment, so important for rapport building.\n\nQ11: Suicidal ideation without plan. The \"wish to disappear\" is significant. Even without a plan, this needs attention. It's a risk factor.\n\nQ12-Q13: No psychosis, so that's a relief. No hallucinations or delusions.\n\nQ14: Sleep quality issues, consistent with insomnia and depression.\n\nQ15: Cognitive issues like memory problems, zoning out. Could be due to depression, anxiety, or sleep disruption.\n\nPatterns: Persistent depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood, sleep, fatigue) combined with anxiety (generalized, avoidance), somatic symptoms, cognitive issues, and some irritability. The stressor of divorce is a key factor here. The symptoms have been present for two weeks, but the divorce is a recent event, so maybe an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood? Or major depressive disorder with anxious distress?\n\nPotential areas: Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, possible somatic symptom disorder. The avoidance could also align with Social Anxiety or PTSD, but the stressor is the divorce, so adjustment disorder makes sense. \n\nRisk factors: Suicidal ideation (even without plan) is a big one. Also, the somatic symptoms might lead to medical issues if not addressed, but they've already been checked. \n\nWait, Q11 mentions thoughts of hurting themselves but no plan. That's still a risk. The patient's feeling dismissed by others could affect treatment engagement. \n\nClinical significance areas: The primary concerns are depressive symptoms, anxiety, and the suicidal ideation. The somatic symptoms are likely stress-related. \n\nPutting this all together, the summary needs to list these points concisely. Make sure to note the stressor (divorce) as an etiological factor. The symptoms are within the last two weeks? The patient mentions \"past two weeks\" in the initial Q1, so duration is 2 weeks. The DSM-5 criteria for MDD require at least two weeks, so that's a fit. \n\nCheck the DSM criteria for MDD: depressed mood, anhedonia, weight/appetite changes (not mentioned here), sleep issues, psychomotor agitation/retardation (maybe the fatigue), fatigue, feelings of worthlessness (implied by the divorce thoughts), diminished concentration (Q15), and thoughts of death. They have several of these. \n\nThe anxiety symptoms with worry (GAD) and avoidance (maybe social anxiety or specific phobia?). The adjustment disorder would need that stressor being the primary cause, but the symptoms might meet MDD regardless. \n\nAlso, the suicidal ideation without plan is still a risk that needs to be addressed. The avoidance (Q8) could be part of the anxiety component. \n\nSo, the main diagnosis might be Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress, or with mixed anxiety. Or Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood and anxiety. But given the duration, maybe MDD is more appropriate. \n\nAlso, somatic symptoms (headaches, back pain) could be linked to anxiety/depression, so Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't indicated unless there's excessive focus on symptoms, which the patient hasn't stated. The doctor already checked and found no physical cause, so that's somatic symptoms due to another issue. \n\nPutting it all together, the key points for the clinical summary: depressive symptoms (anhedonia, depressed mood 4 days a week, suicidal ideation, fatigue, sleep issues), anxiety features (worry, irritability, avoidance), somatic symptoms, and the significant stressor (divorce). Risk factors: SI, functional impairment from avoidance and withdrawal. \n\nI need to structure all this into the required sections without speculation, just the facts from the answers. Make sure not to include things not mentioned, like appetite changes unless stated. The user says to avoid speculation, so stick strictly to the responses.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Depressive symptoms**: Anhedonia (Q1), persistent low mood/feelings of hopelessness (Q2), fatigue (Q4, Q15), and suicidal ideation without plan (Q11).  \n- **Anxiety symptoms**: Generalized anxiety (Q6), intermittent panic-like sensations (Q7), avoidance of social/ stressful situations (Q8).  \n- **Psychomotor/ somatic symptoms**: Insomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q14), unexplained somatic pain (headaches, back pain) (Q9.  \n- **Cognitive dysfunction**: Impaired concentration/memory (Q15).  \n- **Irritability and affective lability**: Increased anger outbursts (Q3.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Temporal alignment with stressor**: Symptoms (mood disturbance, anxiety, somatization) emerged in the context of a recent divorce (Q2, Q10.  \n- **Diurnal variation**: Symptoms fluctuate with triggers (e.g., divorce-related thoughts worsen mood; social interactions trigger avoidance.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Impact on work performance (Q5, Q15), social withdrawal (Q8, Q10.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Criteria met for anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and suicidal ideation (Q1, Q2, Q4, Q11.  \n- **Anxiety spectrum features**: Mixed anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder [GAD] symptoms) with avoidance behavior (Q6, Q7, Q8.  \n- **Psychosocial stressor impact**: Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (Q2, Q3, Q8.  \n- **Cognitive-behavioral dysregulation**: Attentional lapses and functional decline (Q15.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Suicidal ideation** (Q11: non-planful but recurrent, requiring risk assessment.  \n- **Psychosocial instability**: Social withdrawal, job performance impairment, and perceived invalidation of symptoms (Q10.  \n- **Chronic stress somatization**: Unexplained pain symptoms (Q9, Q15.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with **major depressive features** (anhedonia, depressed mood, functional impairment, suicidal ideation) and **mixed anxiety symptoms** (generalized anxiety, avoidance behaviors). The symptom onset correlates with a recent divorce, suggesting a **stressor-mediated etiology** (adjustment disorder). **Cognitive impairment** (concentration/memory deficits) and **non-specific somatic complaints** (headaches, back pain) are present, likely secondary to emotional distress. **Suicidal ideation** (non-planful) and **perceived medical under-recognition** (Q10) highlight urgent care needs. No psychotic features (Q12-Q13.  \n\n**Diagnosis Considerations**:  \n- **Primary**: Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress (DSM-5 criteria) or Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  \n- **Secondary**: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (specify social/interpersonal triggers).  \n- **Risk Priorities**: Suicidal ideation, social/occupational impairment, and unresolved stressor sequelae.  \n\n**Next Steps**: Formal depression/anxiety screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7), collateral history on divorce-related stress, and risk stabilization planning. Rule out medical contributors to somatic complaints (already done; focus on psychosocial factors.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains. All 23 questions were touched upon, but some areas could have been explored more deeply. For instance, questions 16 (unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images), 17 (feeling driven to perform certain behaviors), 18 (dissociation), 19 (identity), 20 (relationships), 21 (substance use), 22 (smoking), and 23 (using medicines on your own) were either not directly asked or not fully probed. However, the therapist did follow up on critical areas such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were moments where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about sleep quality (question 14), the therapist could have specifically inquired about sleep onset, maintenance, or early morning awakening. Additionally, some questions were slightly rephrased but remained clinically relevant. Overall, the questions were accurate but could have benefited from stricter DSM-5 terminology.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question naturally following from the patient's previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent and organized approach, seamlessly transitioning between different symptom domains. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, making the conversation smooth and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear and comprehensive justification for the diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The reasoning directly linked specific patient symptoms to DSM-5 criteria, and the differential diagnosis was considered. The therapist also outlined a detailed treatment plan addressing medication, psychotherapy, and social support.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a professional tone, but there were moments where responses seemed somewhat formulaic. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling numb and having suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more personalized emotional support. However, the therapist did acknowledge the patient's distress and validated their experiences."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively used it to guide the assessment. While most domains were covered, a few areas could have been explored more deeply. The conversation was well-structured, and the diagnostic justification was clear and sound. Empathy and professionalism were generally present, but could be further enhanced. Overall, this was a thorough and competent assessment.",
