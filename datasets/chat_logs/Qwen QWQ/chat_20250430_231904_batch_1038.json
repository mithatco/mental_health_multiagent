      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. The user wants a structured assessment based on the patient's responses. First, I need to make sure I follow the exact format they specified. \n\nStarting with the compassionate summary. The patient mentioned feeling anxious in social situations, avoids gatherings, and has sleep issues. I should acknowledge their struggle with social interactions and the distress it causes, showing empathy.\n\nNext is the diagnosis. The key symptoms are social anxiety leading to avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and insomnia. The DSM-5 mentions Social Anxiety Disorder (previously called social phobia) which fits here. They don't show depressive features like hopelessness, so major depressive disorder isn't the focus. GAD is possible but the core issue is social interactions. The insomnia is tied to social worries, so it's secondary. So the primary diagnosis would be <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\nFor the reasoning section, I need to link the answers to the diagnosis. The patient's avoidance of social gatherings, fear of judgment, and context-specific anhedonia align with SAD criteria. The sleep issues stem from rumination about social interactions, supporting the diagnosis. Also, no signs of bipolar or PTSD since there's no mention of mania or trauma triggers beyond social anxiety. \n\nTreatment steps: CBT is first-line for SAD. Medication options like SSRIs could be considered. Sleep hygiene is important, maybe addressing the anxiety's impact on sleep. Also, gradual exposure therapy to social settings. The patient's responses don't indicate severe impairment yet, so early intervention is key. \n\nWait, the user's example included tags, so I need to use <sym> for symptoms like \"avoidance of social gatherings\" and \"insomnia caused by social worries\". Also, quotes from the patient's answers. Let me check the responses again. The patient said, \"I just feel anxious or nervous... I can't sleep because my mind races about what others think of me.\" That's a direct quote to include.\n\nI must ensure all required sections are present and formatted correctly. No markdown, just the specified structure. Also, make sure to use the exact headings with asterisks. \n\nDouble-check the diagnosis: The DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and significant distress. The patient's lack of pleasure in social activities (anhedonia in that context) and sleep disruption due to social anxiety all fit. The absence of depressive symptoms (no hopelessness, just anxiety-specific distress) rules out depression. \n\nTreatment steps should be numbered and practical. CBT is top, then sleep hygiene, possible meds, and monitoring. \n\nMake sure all required tags are correctly placed. Also, avoid any mention of things not in the data, like PTSD or substance use, since the user's info doesn't support that. \n\nAlright, putting it all together with the structure and tags as specified. Let me draft each section step by step to ensure compliance.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms such as social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and sleep disruption driven by self-consciousness</sym> reflect a deeply felt struggle to navigate social interactions. Your descriptions of feeling \"trapped\" by the pressure of others\u2019 judgments and the toll it takes on both enjoyment and rest highlight the emotional weight of these experiences. It\u2019s clear this has become a recurring source of distress, and it takes courage to begin addressing it.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional), with features suggestive of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> related to social performance.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s <sym>avoidance of social gatherings</sym>, <sym>anhedonia in group settings</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal (e.g., sleep disruption due to rumination)</sym> align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Fear of negative evaluation is central, as noted in quotes like <quote>\"I feel anxious\u2026 if plans involve a big gathering, I avoid them\"</quote>. The absence of generalized depressive features (<sym>hopelessness</sym> or pervasive low mood) and the specificity of distress to social contexts rule out <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. <med>Insomnia Disorder</med> is secondary to social anxiety. The anticipatory <sym>worry about others\u2019 judgments</sym> also meets criteria for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> if persistent and excessive anxiety about social performance is confirmed in further assessment.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety:** Focus on exposure-based strategies to gradually reduce avoidance and challenge catastrophic social fears.  \n2. **Sleep hygiene optimization:** Address <sym>insomnia</sym> through techniques like cognitive restructuring for nighttime worries and limiting pre-sleep social-media use to reduce rumination.  \n3. **Psychoeducation about social anxiety:** Normalize symptoms and reduce shame by explaining the neurobiology of social evaluation anxiety.  \n4. **Consider low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) if CBT alone is insufficient for functional improvement.**  \n5. **Further assessment for GAD:** Explore whether <sym>worry</sym> extends to non-social areas to clarify diagnostic boundaries.  \n\nThis approach prioritizes addressing core symptoms while addressing secondary distress (e.g., sleep) and ensuring no comorbid conditions (e.g., PTSD, bipolar disorder) are overlooked. Let\u2019s proceed step-by-step, starting with a CBT referral and monitoring for symptom patterns beyond the past two weeks.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through the patient's answers carefully. The user provided the responses to the first four questions of the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. My task is to analyze these and structure the clinical summary as specified.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms and concerns. The patient mentioned not finding interest in activities when around others, which might relate to social anxiety. They feel trapped and anxious about social situations, especially when they have to socialize again. The lack of pleasure in group settings (anhedonia in social context) and persistent anxiety around social interactions stand out. Their sleep problem is insomnia due to rumination on others' perceptions. They don't report anger but do mention irritability when forced into big gatherings, which they avoid. The absence of increased energy despite poor sleep suggests that the insomnia isn't due to mania or hypomania.\n\nNext, looking for patterns: all responses point to social interactions as a central stressor. The patient's mood disturbances are context-specific (worsen in social settings), and avoidance is a coping mechanism. They avoid situations that cause distress, which is a common coping strategy but can lead to worsening issues.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Social anxiety disorder seems likely given the fear of judgment and avoidance. Generalized anxiety disorder could be a consideration because of the persistent anxiety and worry about social interactions. The insomnia related to rumination on social concerns ties into the anxiety. There's also anhedonia in social contexts, which can be part of depression, but the patient doesn't report feeling hopeless or depressed in a general sense\u2014only when socializing. So maybe depression isn't the main issue here, but rather the social anxiety affecting their enjoyment.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs: The avoidance behavior could lead to social withdrawal and impaired functioning. The insomnia is a concern as it can exacerbate anxiety. The patient's nervousness and avoidance might indicate a risk of developing more severe anxiety if not addressed. However, there's no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm, so that's not a risk factor here. The persistent anxiety could signal a chronic issue if it's been ongoing beyond two weeks, but the timeframe is limited to the past two weeks as per the questions.\n\nNow, summarizing in clinical terms: The main symptoms are social avoidance due to fear of judgment, context-dependent anhedonia, anticipatory anxiety regarding social interactions, and sleep disturbance from rumination. The patterns indicate that social situations are a primary trigger. The clinical areas include Social Anxiety Disorder and possibly GAD. The risk is the impact on daily functioning through avoidance and sleep issues.\n\nI need to make sure not to speculate beyond the given info. Avoid labeling definitively but note the areas that are clinically significant. Also, highlight the absence of certain symptoms like anger (so not bipolar) and the lack of depressive features like general hopelessness. The key points are the social context of symptoms, avoidance, and associated anxiety and sleep issues.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary:**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social context-dependent anhedonia:** Reduced interest/pleasure in activities when around others, despite enjoyment when alone.  \n- **Anticipatory social anxiety:** Preoccupation with others\u2019 perceptions, leading to avoidance of social gatherings and persistent anxiety about future social interactions.  \n- **Persistent anxious arousal:** Marked by restlessness, worry, and ruminative thoughts about social scrutiny, particularly regarding insomnia (sleep disturbance due to preoccupation with others\u2019 judgments).  \n- **Avoidant coping mechanisms:** Avoidance of large social group situations to mitigate anxiety, suggesting behavioral accommodation of distress.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms cluster around **social interactions**, with clear modulation of mood/anxiety based on social context (e.g., improved mood when alone).  \n- No evidence of overt depressive mood (e.g., \"not hopeless,\" no loss of appetite/energy noted in provided data).  \n- Anxiety appears **reactive and situational**, tied to perceived social evaluation.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Areas of Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Core features of fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance, and distress in group settings.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Anticipatory anxiety about social scenarios and persistent worry about others\u2019 judgments.  \n- **Insomnia Disorder:** Sleep disturbance driven by ruminative social-performance anxiety.  \n- **Avoidance-Driven Functional Impairment:** Likely impact on social, occupational, or relational domains due to behavioral restriction.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social withdrawal:** Risk of long-term isolation or restricted lifestyle due to avoidance.  \n- **Sleep disruption:** Chronic insomnia may exacerbate anxiety and impair adaptive functioning.  \n- **Maladaptive coping:** Rigid avoidance may reinforce anxiety over time.  \n- **No acute self-harm/risk:** No reported suicidal ideation, aggression, or psychotic features.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with **social anxiety-driven symptoms**, including context-specific anhedonia, anticipatory anxiety regarding social interactions, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbance is secondary to ruminative worries about social performance. While depressive features (e.g., hopelessness) are absent, the pattern aligns with **Social Anxiety Disorder**, with possible comorbid **Generalized Anxiety Disorder** and **Insomnia Disorder**. Key concerns include functional impairment due to avoidance and the risk of escalating social withdrawal. No acute safety concerns identified. Further assessment is warranted to evaluate symptom severity, duration, and impact on role functioning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "<sym>Symptoms such as social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and sleep disruption driven by self-consciousness</sym> reflect a deeply felt struggle to navigate social interactions. Your descriptions of feeling \"trapped\" by the pressure of others\u2019 judgments and the toll it takes on both enjoyment and rest highlight the emotional weight of these experiences. It\u2019s clear this has become a recurring source of distress, and it takes courage to begin addressing it.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional), with features suggestive of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> related to social performance.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s <sym>avoidance of social gatherings</sym>, <sym>anhedonia in group settings</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal (e.g., sleep disruption due to rumination)</sym> align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Fear of negative evaluation is central, as noted in quotes like <quote>\"I feel anxious\u2026 if plans involve a big gathering, I avoid them\"</quote>. The absence of generalized depressive features (<sym>hopelessness</sym> or pervasive low mood) and the specificity of distress to social contexts rule out <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. <med>Insomnia Disorder</med> is secondary to social anxiety. The anticipatory <sym>worry about others\u2019 judgments</sym> also meets criteria for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> if persistent and excessive anxiety about social performance is confirmed in further assessment.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety:** Focus on exposure-based strategies to gradually reduce avoidance and challenge catastrophic social fears.  \n2. **Sleep hygiene optimization:** Address <sym>insomnia</sym> through techniques like cognitive restructuring for nighttime worries and limiting pre-sleep social-media use to reduce rumination.  \n3. **Psychoeducation about social anxiety:** Normalize symptoms and reduce shame by explaining the neurobiology of social evaluation anxiety.  \n4. **Consider low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) if CBT alone is insufficient for functional improvement.**  \n5. **Further assessment for GAD:** Explore whether <sym>worry</sym> extends to non-social areas to clarify diagnostic boundaries.  \n\nThis approach prioritizes addressing core symptoms while addressing secondary distress (e.g., sleep) and ensuring no comorbid conditions (e.g., PTSD, bipolar disorder) are overlooked. Let\u2019s proceed step-by-step, starting with a CBT referral and monitoring for symptom patterns beyond the past two weeks.",
