      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a detailed Q&A from a patient's assessment, and I need to format the response per their strict structure. \n\nFirst, the compassionate summary needs to capture the patient's main struggles without jargon. The patient is dealing with divorce, which is a key stressor. They mention losing interest in activities (anhedonia), insomnia, and intrusive thoughts about the divorce. I need to highlight their emotional pain and resilience in seeking help.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The symptoms point to several possibilities. The depressive symptoms (low energy, anhedonia) and anxiety (irritability, panic) suggest MDD with anxious distress. The trauma from divorce could fit PTSD, especially with the intrusive thoughts and avoidance. The checking behavior (Q17) might hint at OCD, but since it's tied to trauma, PTSD is more likely. The somatic symptoms are noted but not primary. So the primary diagnosis would be Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depressed Mood. PTSD is a consideration but less certain. \n\nFor reasoning, I need to link each symptom to the criteria. MDD is supported by depressed mood, anhedonia, and fatigue. Anxious distress comes from nervousness and panic. Adjustment Disorder is tied to the divorce as the stressor. PTSD is under consideration because of the intrusive thoughts and avoidance, but the duration might not meet full PTSD criteria yet. OCD is less likely since the checking is contextually linked to stress rather than OCD-specific obsessions. Somatic symptoms are present but not meeting Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria as per DSM-5. \n\nNext steps: Safety first, so assess suicide risk (they have passive ideation). Therapy options like CBT for depression and anxiety, maybe trauma-focused. Address somatic symptoms with medical check-up. Medication if appropriate. Social support is key. \n\nCheck formatting: Ensure the headings are exact with **, tags are correctly applied. No markdown, just plain text. Make sure all required sections are in order and tags are properly placed. Avoid mentioning anything outside the given responses. \n\nWait, the user specified to not include Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly warranted. The patient's somatic complaints are present but linked to stress, so they don't meet SSSD. \n\nCheck the diagnosis section again. Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depression is appropriate here because the stressor (divorce) is recent and the symptoms align. But the depressive features might meet full MDD criteria, so primary is MDD with Anxious Distress. Adjustment Disorder could be a secondary. \n\nOkay, the structure is set. Let me draft each part with the tags now.\n</think>\n\nYou've described a deeply challenging time, marked by overwhelming sadness, relentless anxiety, and a profound sense of disconnection from yourself and your life. Your struggle to find joy in activities you once loved, coupled with the physical toll of sleeplessness and aching body, reflects how much this recent divorce has shaken your foundation. While you\u2019re reaching out for help now, I\u2019m struck by how bravely you\u2019re navigating these feelings despite feeling \"like watching a movie about someone else.\" You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014it\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying immense emotional weight, and help is available to ease this burden.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> (provisional) and <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood</med>, contextualized within ongoing adjustment to marital separation. <med>PTSD</med> features (intrusive thoughts, dissociation) and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> warrant further evaluation.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Depressive criteria**: <sym>Anhedonia</sym> (Q2), Q3), <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q5), Q14), and <sym>self-blame</sym> (Q16) meet DSM-5 criteria for <med>MDD</med>.  \n- **Anxiety correlates**: <sym>Excessive worry</sym> (Q7), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q8), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q9) align with <med>GAD</med>, but the stressor specificity points to <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>.  \n- **Trauma overlay**: Recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the divorce (Q16), <sym>depersonalization</sym> (Q18), and hypervigilance (indirectly via sleeplessness) raise <med>PTSD</med> considerations.  \n- **Exclusion of other disorders**: No <sym>psychotic features</sym> (Q13), <sym>hypomania</sym>, or dissociative identity disorder. <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> (Q10) are secondary to stress, not primary focus.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Safety assessment**: Immediate evaluation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q12) to ensure no active risk, with crisis support resources if needed.  \n2. **Therapy prioritization**:  \n   - <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety.  \n   - <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or trauma-focused CBT to address intrusive thoughts (Q16, Q18).  \n3. **Medication consultation**: Trial of <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) for depressive symptoms and comororbid anxiety.  \n4. **Medical workup**: Blood tests (thyroid function, vitamin D) and cardiology evaluation to rule out organic causes for <sym>chest pain</sym> (Q10.  \n5. **Social support**: Referral to divorce support groups to address relational strain and parenting concerns noted in Q4 and Q19.  \n6. **Sleep hygiene interventions**: Sleep diary tracking and relaxation techniques to address <sym>insomnia</sym> (Q5, Q14.  \n\nThis approach balances immediate safety, trauma processing, and systemic support while ruling out physical health contributors. You\u2019re not expected to manage this alone\u2014treatment can help rebuild your sense of control and connection.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a series of Q&A from a patient's responses to a DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom assessment. My job is to analyze these and structure the response as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to read through all the questions and answers carefully. The patient is an adult, given the form's title. Let me start by identifying the main symptoms and concerns from each answer.\n\nLooking at Q2: The patient has lost interest in previously enjoyed activities like hiking and cooking. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, which is a key symptom of depression. \n\nQ3 addresses depressed mood, which they report as present, with a heavy feeling. \n\nQ4 mentions irritability and anger outbursts, which can be part of depressive disorders but also point to possible adjustment issues. \n\nQ5 talks about insomnia and fatigue, which is common in depression and anxiety. The patient isn't hypomanic since they're not sleeping less with more energy. \n\nQ7-10: Anxiety symptoms like nervousness, panic attacks, avoidance (skipping meetings), and somatic symptoms (headaches, chest tightness) point to significant anxiety. \n\nQ11 indicates possible distrust in medical care, which is important for treatment. \n\nQ12: Suicidal ideation without intent, but they mentioned \"wish to disappear\" but no plan. Still, needs attention. \n\nQ16-17: Intrusive thoughts related to divorce (Q16) and checking behaviors (Q17) might suggest OCD or PTSD elements. \n\nQ18 talks about depersonalization/derealization, which could be linked to severe stress or anxiety disorders. \n\nNow, patterns: The patient's symptoms are multifaceted, combining depressive, anxious, and stress-related symptoms, with possible elements of trauma (due to divorce) and adjustment difficulties. The intrusive thoughts and checking could be OCD or trauma responses. \n\nClinical significance areas: Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, possible adjustment disorder, and maybe PTSD from the divorce. The somatic symptoms (headaches, chest tightness) are likely stress-related but need medical rule-out. The depersonalization adds another layer, often seen in severe anxiety or PTSD. \n\nRisk factors: Suicidal ideation (even non-suicidal), which needs to be evaluated for lethality. The divorce is a major stressor. Lack of social support (roommate complaints, avoiding social interactions) could be a risk. \n\nWarning signs: The SI, somatic symptoms, and impaired functioning (work issues, memory problems). \n\nNeed to make sure not to miss any red flags. Also, the patient's mention of \"wish to disappear\" is a passive ideation. \n\nPutting it all together, the main disorders to consider are Major Depressive Disorder with atypical features (since they're fatigued, not agitated), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, possible adjustment disorder with anxiety or depression, and maybe PTSD if the divorce was traumatic. The checking behavior (Q17) and intrusive thoughts (Q16) could point to OCD but might be better framed in the context of trauma. \n\nThe clinical summary should list these findings concisely, noting the patterns and relevant DSM-5 criteria. Also, highlight the SI and need for further assessment, somatic symptoms warranting medical consultation, and the impact of life stressors. \n\nI need to make sure I don't speculate beyond what the patient reported. For example, the divorce is a stressor, so adjustment disorder is valid. The intrusive thoughts about the divorce might be trauma-related. \n\nAlso, note the depersonalization as a dissociative symptom, which is part of the anxiety spectrum or PTSD. \n\nPutting all this into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a clinical summary. Use correct terminology and ensure it's all based on the provided data without adding assumptions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Depressed mood**: Persistent feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia (Q2), and psychomotor retardation (e.g., fatigue, low energy; Q5, Q14).  \n- **Anxiety features**: Generalized anxiety (Q7, Q8), panic attacks (Q8), and somatic symptoms (headaches, chest tightness; Q10).  \n- **Irritability and anger dysregulation** (Q4).  \n- **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia, non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q14).  \n- **Trauma-related symptoms**: Intrusive thoughts about divorce (Q16), hypervigilance (Q17), and depersonalization (Q18).  \n- **Anxiety-driven avoidance behaviors** (Q9, Q19).  \n- **Suicidal ideation** (non-suicidal; Q12.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Multidimensional distress**: Overlap of depressive, anxious, and trauma-related symptoms, suggesting comorbidity.  \n- **Stressor-driven exacerbation**: Divorce (Q16, Q17) and financial concerns (Q7) as central stressors.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Impact on work (Q15, Q19), parenting, and social relationships (Q4, Q19).  \n- **Secondary somatization** (Q10, Q11) and distrust of medical care (Q11).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** with atypical features (anhedonia, fatigue).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** with panic symptoms and somatic complaints.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood**, triggered by divorce.  \n- **Possible PTSD** (intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance, avoidance; Q16, Q17, Q18.  \n- **OCD spectrum behaviors** (checking; Q17) or *post-traumatic stress triggers*.  \n- **Dissociative symptoms** (depersonalization; Q18) linked to severe emotional distress.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Low-intensity suicidal ideation** (Q12): passive thoughts without intent, but requires assessment for worsening risk.  \n- **Impaired executive functioning** (memory lapses, attention deficits; Q15, Q16).  \n- **Social withdrawal** and strained interpersonal relationships (Q4, Q19.  \n- **Unresolved trauma** from divorce exacerbating symptoms (Q16, Q18.  \n- **Medical distrust** (Q11) may hinder engagement in care.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary (DSM-5 Aligned)**  \nThe patient exhibits a constellation of **depressive (anhedonia, low energy, hopelessness) and anxious symptoms (generalized anxiety, panic, somatization)**, along with **trauma-related features** (intrusive thoughts, dissociation) linked to recent divorce. **Sleep disturbance** and **functional impairment** (work, parenting) are prominent. **Suicidal ideation** is present but not active. **Dissociative symptoms** (depersonalization) and **avoidant behaviors** suggest comorbid adjustment disorder or PTSD. **Medical comorbidity** (somatic symptoms) requires collaborative medical evaluation to rule out alternative etiologies. Risk of escalation is moderate (passive ideation, impaired coping). Prioritize assessment of trauma history, social support, and suicidal risk. Consider **MDD with anxious distress**, **GAD**, and **trauma-related disorders** in differential diagnosis. Rule out **hypothyroidism, chronic pain, or substance use** as contributing factors. Immediate therapeutic focus should address symptom management, stress reduction, and safety planning.  \n\n---  \nThis summary adheres to DSM-5 criteria and prioritizes clinically actionable points without assumptions beyond reported data.",

Your struggle to find joy in activities you once loved, coupled with the physical toll of sleeplessness and aching body, reflects how much this recent divorce has shaken your foundation. While you\u2019re reaching out for help now, I\u2019m struck by how bravely you\u2019re navigating these feelings despite feeling \"like watching a movie about someone else.\" You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014it\u2019s clear you\u2019re carrying immense emotional weight, and help is available to ease this burden.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> (provisional) and <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood</med>, contextualized within ongoing adjustment to marital separation. <med>PTSD</med> features (intrusive thoughts, dissociation) and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> warrant further evaluation.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Depressive criteria**: <sym>Anhedonia</sym> (Q2), Q3), <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q5), Q14), and <sym>self-blame</sym> (Q16) meet DSM-5 criteria for <med>MDD</med>.  \n- **Anxiety correlates**: <sym>Excessive worry</sym> (Q7), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q8), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q9) align with <med>GAD</med>, but the stressor specificity points to <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>.  \n- **Trauma overlay**: Recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the divorce (Q16), <sym>depersonalization</sym> (Q18), and hypervigilance (indirectly via sleeplessness) raise <med>PTSD</med> considerations.  \n- **Exclusion of other disorders**: No <sym>psychotic features</sym> (Q13), <sym>hypomania</sym>, or dissociative identity disorder. <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> (Q10) are secondary to stress, not primary focus.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Safety assessment**: Immediate evaluation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q12) to ensure no active risk, with crisis support resources if needed.  \n2. **Therapy prioritization**:  \n   - <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety.  \n   - <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or trauma-focused CBT to address intrusive thoughts (Q16, Q18).  \n3. **Medication consultation**: Trial of <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) for depressive symptoms and comororbid anxiety.  \n4. **Medical workup**: Blood tests (thyroid function, vitamin D) and cardiology evaluation to rule out organic causes for <sym>chest pain</sym> (Q10.  \n5. **Social support**: Referral to divorce support groups to address relational strain and parenting concerns noted in Q4 and Q19.  \n6. **Sleep hygiene interventions**: Sleep diary tracking and relaxation techniques to address <sym>insomnia</sym> (Q5, Q14.  \n\nThis approach balances immediate safety, trauma processing, and systemic support while ruling out physical health contributors. You\u2019re not expected to manage this alone\u2014treatment can help rebuild your sense of control and connection.",
