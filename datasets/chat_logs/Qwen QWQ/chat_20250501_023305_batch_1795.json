      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reviewing the user's responses carefully. The patient reported significant anhedonia, low mood, and hopelessness since their divorce, which points to depressive symptoms. The sleep issues (insomnia/hypersomnia) and fatigue fit with MDD. The anxiety symptoms like worry, panic sensations, and avoidance behaviors suggest comororbid GAD. The depersonalization and identity issues in answers 17 and 18 might point to adjustment disorder or even PTSD if the divorce was traumatic. But since there's no mention of trauma triggers like re-experiencing, maybe adjustment disorder is better here.\n\nThey mentioned passive suicidal ideation without a plan, so that's a risk to note. The alcohol use is moderate, not dependent, but still a concern. The DSM-5 criteria for MDD with anxious distress seems to fit best here. Let me check all criteria again: depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep issues, psychomotor changes, worthlessness, concentration problems, and those anxious features. Yes, that covers the 5+ symptoms needed for MDD. The anxious distress specifer is there with the nervousness, panic, and fear of poor performance (implied by worry about the future). \n\nI need to make sure there's no bipolar, but the lack of manic/hypomanic episodes (they denied increased activity in Q5) rules out that. Somatic symptoms are present but linked to anxiety or depression, so SSD isn't primary here. The key is to prioritize the mood disorder with anxiety, and note adjustment issues as a possible secondary factor. The next steps should address both the depression and anxiety, plus coping strategies and social support.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, persistent sadness, and emotional numbness paint a picture of profound distress since your divorce.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed set of answers from a patient's questionnaire using the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for adults. My task is to analyze these responses and structure the findings into the five points they mentioned: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a summary.\n\nStarting with the first question, A1 says the patient has little interest or pleasure since the divorce. That's a classic depressive symptom\u2014anhedonia. The mention of \"since the divorce\" points to a possible trigger. Then in A2, they talk about feeling down and hopeless, which is another core depressive feature. They also mention crying without reason, which could be linked to dysphoria. \n\nLooking at A3, irritability and anger are noted. That's common in depression too, especially in some populations. The patient's report of snapping at their sister (A19) ties into that. Now, sleep issues in A4: hypersomnia or insomnia? They mention both excessive sleep but not restful, and early morning awakenings. That's typical in depression. \n\nQuestion 5 asks about increased activity, but the patient says no\u2014they're more paralyzed, so that's not hypomania. Moving to anxiety-related questions (Q6-8), the patient has anxiety, nervousness, and avoidance of social situations. The panic-like symptoms in A7 (chest tightness, trouble breathing) when thinking about the future or finances. They're avoiding social interactions (A8), which is a behavioral response to anxiety. \n\nPhysical symptoms (Q9): unexplained aches, which can be somaticization of psychological stress. They know there's no physical cause, so that's probably stress-related. Q10: they don't feel their health is neglected, but they acknowledge others might see it as overreacting. \n\nSelf-harm thoughts (Q11): they mention not wanting to harm themselves but wishing to disappear. That's a passive ideation, which is a risk factor. No active suicidal intent, but still needs attention. \n\nPsychosis (Q12-13): they don't report hallucinations or delusions, just racing thoughts. So that's not an issue here. \n\nSleep problems again in Q14, which connects back to depression. Memory issues (Q15) and concentration (Q23) suggest cognitive impairment, which can come from depression or anxiety. The patient mentions feeling detached (Q17) and identity issues (Q18), which could be depersonalization, typical in severe depression or PTSD. \n\nSocial withdrawal (Q19) exacerbates their depressive state. Substance use: they have some alcohol use (A20) but not excessive, and no other substance misuse (A21-22). The alcohol use here is likely a coping mechanism. \n\nCognitive difficulties (Q23) in concentration and decision-making are also part of the symptom cluster. \n\nNow, putting this together, the main symptoms are depressive features (anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep issues, fatigue, cognitive problems), anxiety (generalized, panic-like symptoms), and some avoidance behaviors. The trigger is the divorce, which is a significant life stressor. \n\nPatterns: The answers consistently point to a persistent depressive disorder post-divorce, with anxiety exacerbating symptoms. The cognitive and somatic symptoms align with that. The person is using alcohol moderately to cope but not in a harmful way yet. \n\nClinical significance: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress seems likely. The avoidance and panic symptoms add to the anxiety component. The passive suicidal ideation (wish to disappear) is a risk, though no active plan. The cognitive and somatic symptoms support a diagnosis. \n\nRisk factors: The passive ideation is a warning sign, as is the recent divorce which is a stressor. The social withdrawal and substance use, even though it's moderate, can worsen outcomes. \n\nPotential areas to look into: The patient's adjustment to the divorce, possible adjustment disorder vs. MDD, and the co-occurring anxiety. Need to assess for PTSD elements given the divorce might have been traumatic. Also, their identity crisis (Q18) and social withdrawal need attention. \n\nRemember to avoid speculation, just stick to what's presented. They didn't mention any psychotic features, so exclude that. The key is to structure the points clearly under each category as specified. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss anything. The loss of interest, depressed mood, sleep issues, weight change isn't mentioned here, but maybe not needed. The DSM-5 criteria for MDD require 5 symptoms including depressed mood or anhedonia. Here, they have anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep, fatigue (implied by sleep issues), worthlessness (implied in their self-blame?), and reduced concentration. That's more than enough. \n\nAlso, the anxious distress specifiers (panic, fear of poor performance, etc.) are present from the anxiety questions. \n\nSo the clinical summary needs to list these points concisely, using terms like persistent depressive symptoms, anxious distress, social withdrawal, passive suicidal ideation, cognitive deficits, and adjustment issues post-divorce. \n\nRisk factors include passive ideation, social isolation, and alcohol use as a coping mechanism. \n\nI need to present all this in the required structure without fluff, using professional terms but clearly.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Persistent depressive symptoms**: Anhedonia, low self-worth, hopelessness, and pervasive sadness post-divorce, with insomnia/hypersomnia, fatigue, and psychomotor retardation (implied by \"paralyzed,\" slowed cognition).  \n- **Anxiety features**: Generalized anxiety, somatic symptoms (headaches, GI distress), and panic-like episodes (chest tightness, shortness of breath) triggered by stressors (e.g., finances, future uncertainty).  \n- **Irritability and emotional dysregulation**: Outbursts, guilt over reactivity, and social withdrawal.  \n- **Cognitive impairment**: Difficulty concentrating, decision-making, and intrusive rumination on divorce-related \"what-ifs.\"  \n- **Psychological distress**: Feelings of depersonalization/derealization, identity disruption, and social isolation.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Temporal link to life stressor**: Symptoms emerged post-divorce, with persistent impairment in functioning.  \n- **Somatic and emotional dysregulation**: Complaints of unexplained physical symptoms (headaches, GI distress) align with psychological distress.  \n- **Avoidance behavior**: Social withdrawal (e.g., avoiding friends, public spaces) and emotional numbing.  \n- **Maladaptive coping**: Moderate alcohol use to \"numb the edges,\" but no active substance dependency.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress**: Core depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low energy, cognitive slowing) combined with anxious arousal (restlessness, worry).  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and Anxiety**: Symptoms onset clearly tied to divorce, but duration and severity suggest more than an acute stress response.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Excessive worry, somatic symptoms, and avoidance behaviors.  \n- **Trauma/Adjustment-Related Features**: Depersonalization episodes and identity disruption suggest possible adjustment-related dissociation.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Passive suicidal ideation**: Reports of wishing to \"disappear,\" indicating distress and hopelessness.  \n- **Social isolation**: Withdrawal from support networks may worsen symptoms.  \n- **Cognitive deficits**: Impaired focus/work performance (e.g., difficulty completing tasks) impacts functioning.  \n- **Moderate alcohol use**: Escalation risk if coping mechanisms deteriorate.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary (DSM-5 Terminology):**  \nThe patient presents with **persistent depressive symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**, including anhedonia, depressed mood, psychomotor retardation, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue. Comorbid **Anxious Distress Specifier** is supported by excessive worry, somatic symptoms, and panic-like episodes. **Avoidance behaviors** (e.g., social withdrawal, situational avoidance) and moderate alcohol use suggest **maladaptive coping strategies**. **Passive suicidal ideation** (\"wish to disappear\") warrants monitoring. **Adjustment-related dissociation** (depersonalization) and identity disruption highlight grief/loss sequelae post-divorce. Somatic symptoms (headaches, GI distress) may reflect somaticized anxiety or depressive symptoms. No psychotic features or substance dependency detected.  \n\n**Priority Areas for Evaluation:**  \n- **Suicidality/ESI risk assessment** (passive ideation).  \n- **Cognitive and functional impairment** (work/social withdrawal.  \n- **Depression-anxiety comorbidity** and adjustment to life changes.  \n- **Substance use trends** and coping mechanisms.  \n\nFurther assessment required for trauma/PTSD if divorce involved interpersonal trauma or betrayal.",
