      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the response exactly as the user specified. Let me start by breaking down the requirements again. The user wants a professional assessment following a specific format. The first part is a compassionate summary. I should paraphrase the patient's experiences with empathy. Then, the diagnosis section must come next, followed by reasoning and recommended steps. The tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes need to be correctly applied.\n\nLooking at the patient's answers, their main issues are around social anxiety. The panic attacks, avoidance, and physical symptoms like stomach aches and panic attacks point towards Social Anxiety Disorder. The symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for SAD, including persistent fear of negative evaluation, avoidance behaviors, and significant distress. The panic attacks might be part of the SAD rather than Panic Disorder unless they occur outside social contexts, but here they seem linked. The depersonalization and derealization during social interactions are common in severe anxiety. The substance use (alcohol) is minimal but needs monitoring.\n\nWait, the user mentioned not to default to Somatic Symptom Disorder unless clearly indicated. The somatic symptoms (stomach aches, throat tightness) are tied to anxiety triggers, so they\u2019re likely somatic symptoms from anxiety, not a separate disorder. The thoughts of wanting to disappear are noted but not self-harm, so that\u2019s important. \n\nThe patient's avoidance of promotions and relationships indicates significant impairment. The cognitive symptoms like rumination and self-doubt fit into the social anxiety framework. The CBT approach is standard for SAD, so that should be a recommendation. SSRIs like escitalopram are first-line medications. The patient's use of alcohol as a coping mechanism should be addressed to prevent escalation. \n\nI need to ensure the diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) as the primary diagnosis. The other possible comorbidities like GAD might come into play, but the core is SAD. The depersonalization is part of the anxiety response. \n\nMake sure the tags are properly placed. Like wrapping Social Anxiety Disorder in med tags, symptoms in sym, and quotes from the patient's answers in quote tags. \n\nDouble-check the structure: first paragraph summarizing empathetically, then Diagnosis heading with the disorder, then the reasoning, then the recommendations. The tags must be correct. Let me avoid mentioning anything outside the provided info. \n\nYes, the patient mentions panic attacks in social contexts, so that\u2019s part of the SAD diagnosis. The avoidance, fear of negative evaluation, and physiological symptoms all fit. The patient's functional impairment is clear through work and relationship issues. The recommendations should include CBT, medication, substance monitoring, and maybe a referral for CBT. \n\nAlright, putting it all together step by step, ensuring each section is correctly formatted with the right tags and follows the structure precisely. No markdown, just the text with the specified tags and headings.\n</think>\n\nYour description paints a picture of profound struggle with <sym>somatic distress, social avoidance, and self-critical thoughts</sym>, all anchored in intense fear of being judged by others.

Monitor for side effects.  \n3. **Substance use monitoring**: Track alchol use frequency; recommend non-drug relaxation strategies (e.g., grounding techniques).  \n4. **Social skills training**: Practice low-stakes social interactions (e.g., coffee chats) to rebuild tolerance.  \n5. **Medical clearance**: Rule out thyroid issues (to explain energy drain) via blood work.  \n6. **Weekly tracking**: Use a social anxiety journal to identify triggers and progress.  \n\nYour willingness to confront these challenges already shows resilience. Small, gradual steps\u2014like starting with brief workplace conversations\u2014can build momentum. You aren\u2019t alone in this; evidence-based care can reduce these patterns.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. First, I need to go through each part of the user's response step by step. The user provided the patient's answers to the DSM-5 questionnaire and wants a clinical summary. \n\nStarting with the symptoms. The patient reports losing interest in social activities, feeling down when thinking about missed social events, irritability in groups, and anxiety. They mentioned panic attacks, avoidance of social situations, physical symptoms like stomach aches and throat tightening, and ruminating on social gaffes. They also rehearse social interactions, feel detached during events, and have trouble with self-identity and relationships. They use alcohol to cope, though not excessively. \n\nLooking for patterns: The recurring theme here is social anxiety. The patient's symptoms all seem tied to social interactions. They avoid situations, have physical symptoms when in such settings, and their anxiety is impacting their work (like freezing during presentations). The avoidance and preparation rituals (like rehearsing small talk) point towards OCD traits, but more likely part of social anxiety. The detachment and feeling watched might indicate derealization or depersonalization. The worry about others' judgments is classic social anxiety disorder.\n\nClinical significance areas would include social anxiety disorder definitely. The panic attacks and avoidance could also point towards panic disorder, but since they're context-specific, it's more likely part of SAD. The rumination and repetitive thoughts might suggest OCD, but without compulsions beyond the rituals. The depersonalization during social events is concerning. The alcohol use is a coping mechanism but not at a harmful level yet. The impact on relationships and work is significant.\n\nRisk factors: The patient hasn't mentioned self-harm or suicidal intent beyond the fleeting wish to disappear, which they acknowledge isn't a plan. The use of alcohol is minimal but could escalate. The avoidance is leading to social withdrawal and strained relationships, which are risk factors for worsening mental health.\n\nNow, structuring the summary. Need to use clinical terms. So main symptoms are anhedonia (but only in social contexts), depressed mood related to social loss, irritability, anxiety, panic, avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms, rumination, safety behaviors (rehearsing), depersonalization, relationship issues, and mild substance use. \n\nFor clinical significance, Social Anxiety Disorder is primary. Possible comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder due to constant worry, Panic Disorder (since panic attacks are present), maybe some OCD features, Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder symptoms, and adjustment issues. The substance use is a coping strategy but not a disorder yet. \n\nRisk factors: The social withdrawal and impaired occupational functioning (freezing during presentations) are important. The depersonalization could indicate higher anxiety severity. The patient's recognition of the problem but feeling stuck is a point to note.\n\nNeed to summarize all this concisely without speculation. Ensure all points are supported by the answers. Avoid mentioning things not covered. For example, they didn't mention hallucinations except their internal voice, so that's not a psychosis indicator. The alcohol use is only a few times a month, so not substance use disorder yet.\n\nPutting it all together into the required sections: symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risks, and a summary in clinical terms. Make sure to use terms like \"anhedonia,\" \"avoidant behaviors,\" \"panic attacks,\" \"somatic symptoms,\" \"rumination,\" \"safety behaviors,\" \"depersonalization,\" \"social withdrawal,\" \"substance use as coping,\" etc.\n\nCheck if I missed any key points. The patient mentions not feeling close to others and pushing people away, which points to relational issues from anxiety. The self-doubt about their identity and desires is part of the depression or anxiety component. \n\nOkay, structure the answer as per the instructions: 1 to 5 points, then the summary. Need to be concise and professional.\n</think>\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social anhedonia** (loss of pleasure in social activities).  \n- **Depressed mood** tied to perceived social failure.  \n- **Irritability** in group settings.  \n- **Persistent anxiety** (autonomic arousal: hand tremors, gastrointestinal distress).  \n- **Panic attacks** triggered by unavoidable social exposure.  \n- **Avoidance behaviors** (skipped promotions, events, or responsibilities).  \n- **Cognitive distortions** (rumination on social \"failures,\" fear of judgment).  \n- **Somatic symptoms** (stomach aches, throat tightness).  \n- **Safety behaviors** (rehearsing small talk, using alcohol to mitigate anxiety).  \n- **Depersonalization/derealization** during social interactions.  \n- **Impaired social/occupational functioning** (avoiding promotions, work performance issues).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Social context specificity**: All symptoms escalate in anticipation of or during social interactions.  \n- **Cognitive-affective-behavioral triad**: Negative self-perception (\"overreacting\"), physical anxiety, and avoidance/rituals to cope.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance leads to missed opportunities (e.g., promotions, friendships).  \n- **Self-awareness with ambivalence**: Recognizes distress but struggles to modify behaviors.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Core presentation with marked avoidance and functional impairment.  \n- **Panic Disorder with Social Phobia**: Panic attacks triggered by social triggers.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Chronic worry about social evaluation.  \n- **Possible comorbid adjustment disorder**: Relational withdrawal and identity uncertainty.  \n- **Substance use as a coping mechanism**: Mild alcohol use to manage anxiety.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social withdrawal** and reduced interpersonal connections.  \n- **Occupational dysfunction** (e.g., freezing during presentations).  \n- **Emerging somatic symptom disorder** (somatic complaints linked to anxiety.  \n- **Risk of escalating safety behaviors** (e.g., increased avoidance leading to reduced social resilience).  \n\n**5. Summary of Observations (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with **prolonged social anxiety** (DSM-5 criterion A for SAD met: marked fear of social scrutiny, avoidance/physiological reactivity). Symptoms include **anhedonia in social contexts**, **anxiety-related somatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, tachycardia), and **panic attacks** in unavoidable social exposure. **Cognitive symptoms** include persistent rumination on perceived social failures, **safety behaviors** (e.g., rehearsal of speech, alcohol use), and **emotional numbing/derealization** during social interactions. **Functional impairment** is noted in occupational (presentation difficulties, missed promotions) and relational domains (pushing away relationships due to fear of judgment). **Low acute risk of self-harm**, though existential distress (\"wishing to disappear\") requires monitoring. Rule out **comorbid adjustment disorder with anxious mood** or **GAD**. Consider **OCD spectrum behaviors** (rehearsing speech) versus SAD-driven compulsions. **Assessment of alcohol use** is warranted to prevent escalation.  \n\nFurther evaluation should prioritize **social anxiety severity (e.g., LSAS-SR), cognitive distortions (e.g., DAS-IV), and social functioning impacts.** Collaborative psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and possible SSRIs may be indicated. Monitor avoidance patterns and safety behaviors for interference with recovery.",

Questions were phrased in clinically relevant ways, and the therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning.",

The reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist also considered alternative diagnoses and ruled them out based on patient responses.",

Your efforts to mask anxiety\u2014rehearsing small talk, using alcohol to \"edge\" down, or faking illnesses\u2014highlight how deeply your anxiety has woven itself into daily life. The <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>physical sensations of dread</sym> during social demands must be incredibly isolatinging, yet you continue to seek help, which takes immense courage. Your <quote>\"wish to disappear\"</quote> reflects the weight of feeling trapped by your own mind.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with prominent <med>avoidance, somatic symptoms, and panic features</med>, and comorbid <med>generalized anxiety</med> and <med>adjustment-related emotional distress</med>.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Core SAD criteria met**: Persistent <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social/performance situations</sym>, and <sym>physiological reactivity (e.g., panic attacks)</sym> align with DSM-5 criteria for SAD. The <sym>anhedonia in social settings</sym> and <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym> reflect disorder severity.  \n- **Panic attacks** are <sym>context-specific</sym> (triggered by social exposure), not spontaneous), supportinging SAD over Panic Disorder.  \n- <sym>Somatic symptoms (e.g., stomach aches, throat tightness)</sym> are anxiety-mediated, not better explained by <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> due to clear anxiety-driven etiology.  \n- <sym>Depersonalization</sym> during social interactions reflects acute anxiety-driven dissociation, not primary psychotic features.  \n- <sym>Low-level substance use (alcohol)</sym> is a maladaptive coping strategy requiring monitoring.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting SAD**: Focus on exposure therapy to reduce avoidance, cognitive restructuring of fear of judgment, and interoceptive exposure for panic symptoms.  \n2. **SSRI trial**: Escitalopram or sertraline for anxiety reduction, paired with CBT. Monitor for side effects.  \n3. **Substance use monitoring**: Track alchol use frequency; recommend non-drug relaxation strategies (e.g., grounding techniques).  \n4. **Social skills training**: Practice low-stakes social interactions (e.g., coffee chats) to rebuild tolerance.  \n5. **Medical clearance**: Rule out thyroid issues (to explain energy drain) via blood work.  \n6. **Weekly tracking**: Use a social anxiety journal to identify triggers and progress.  \n\nYour willingness to confront these challenges already shows resilience. Small, gradual steps\u2014like starting with brief workplace conversations\u2014can build momentum. You aren\u2019t alone in this; evidence-based care can reduce these patterns.",
