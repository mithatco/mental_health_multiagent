      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to tackle this user's query step by step. Let's start by understanding their instructions. They want a mental health assessment based on the provided questionnaire responses. The user emphasized structure, so I must follow exactly the format they specified. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each of their answers again. The patient is clearly struggling with social situations. They mentioned avoiding promotions due to presentations and panic attacks. The key symptoms here are avoidance behaviors, panic, and somatic symptoms like headaches and muscle tension related to social events. \n\nLooking at DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), the patient's symptoms align perfectly. They experience fear of embarrassment, avoidance of situations like parties, and impairment in work. The panic attacks and somatic symptoms might also point to Panic Disorder with Social Anxiety features. \n\nI should check if Somatic Symptom Disorder is applicable. The headaches and muscle tension are unexplained medically, but they\u2019re tied to social stressors, so it's more likely anxiety-related. The patient also mentioned their doctor told them to relax, which they found invalidating. This could contribute to their distress but doesn't meet Somatic Symptom Disorder criteria since the symptoms are better explained by anxiety.\n\nThe user's instructions say not to default to SSD unless warranted, so I should rule that out. The primary issue is clearly anxiety, specifically SAD with panic features. \n\nNow, structuring the response: The compassionate summary should acknowledge their struggle with anxiety and avoidance. The diagnosis must be Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22) with panic features. \n\nIn the reasoning, I need to connect each symptom to the diagnosis. Mention avoidance, panic episodes, and somatic symptoms tied to social interactions. Clarify why Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't the primary here.\n\nNext steps should include therapy (CBT), possibly medication, addressing invalidation, and monitoring for depression. Need to use tags properly: medical terms in <med>, symptoms in <sym>, and quotes from the patient.\n\nI must ensure all sections are in the correct order, with proper formatting. Avoid any markdown except the specified tags. Keep the tone empathetic yet professional. Double-check the DSM-5 codes. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\nYour responses reveal significant distress related to social interactions and the physical and emotional toll they take. It sounds like social situations\u2014whether at work, in relationships, or even casual events\u2014trigger intense anxiety, leaving you feeling trapped between a fear of judgment and a desire to connect. Your descriptions of panic attacks, avoidance of promotions, and the frustration of being misunderstood highlight how deeply this affects your life, and I want to acknowledge how bravely you\u2019ve navigated this thus far.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22)</med>, with associated <med>Panic Disorder</med> features. Symptoms align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD) but are primarily contextualized within social/performance settings.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** The pattern of <sym>avoidance of promotions/presentations</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> around social events, and <sym>somatic symptoms (e.g., trembling, blushing, GI distress)</sym> directly align with <med>SAD</med> criteria. The avoidance of promotions reflects significant life impairment.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** The <sym>panic attacks (e.g., canceling a date due to nausea)</sym> and episodic <sym>cardiovascular/respiratory symptoms</sym> meet criteria for panic episodes, likely tied to social triggers.  \n- **Exclusion of Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Somatic symptoms (headaches, muscle tension) are contextualized as stress-related and tied to social fears, not disproportionate to medical findings.  \n- **GAD vs. SAD:** While generalized anxiety traits exist, they are secondary to social-specific triggers.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Social Anxiety:** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoiding promotions) and social avoidance through exposure-based exercises.  \n2. **Panic Response Management:** Teach grounding techniques to address panic episodes (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, cognitive restructuring for catastrophic thoughts).  \n3. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) or SNRIs to reduce baseline anxiety and panic.  \n4. **Validation-Centered Psychoeducation:** Address feelings of <quote>\"my doctor just told me to relax\"</quote> by normalizing symptoms and emphasizing their biological basis.  \n5. **Workplace Accommodations:** Discuss gradual job-related exposure (e.g., small-group presentations) with an occupational therapist to reduce avoidance.  \n6. **Monitor for Comorbid Issues:** Screen for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> if <sym>anhedonia</sym> or hopelessness worsens, though current presentation is anxiety-driven.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through each question and the patient's answers to understand their symptoms. \n\nFirst, the patient agreed to the assessment but mentioned being nervous, which might indicate anxiety or social discomfort. \n\nLooking at Q2 about little interest or pleasure, they said they avoid social situations but aren't sure if that's what the question is about. This might suggest social avoidance rather than anhedonia, maybe social anxiety.\n\nQ3 about feeling down: they feel low after social events, which could be linked to social situations causing depression. But they're concerned about seeming overdramatic, indicating possible self-doubt or fear of judgment.\n\nQ4 on irritability: frustration with changes or meeting people. This could be related to social anxiety causing stress when plans are disrupted.\n\nQ5: They have trouble sleeping due to anxiety before events, not from high energy. That points more towards anxiety-related insomnia rather than mania.\n\nQ6: No increased activity, so probably not a manic episode. They avoid risks and attention, which is the opposite of mania.\n\nQ7-8: They experience constant anxiety with physical symptoms like shaking, trembling voice, and panic. The panic attack example where they canceled a date is a clear sign of panic disorder.\n\nQ9: Avoiding promotions due to presentations. This sounds like avoidance behavior characteristic of social anxiety disorder, possibly leading to occupational impairment.\n\nQ10: Physical aches before social events, but doctors say nothing's wrong. This is psychosomatic, common in anxiety.\n\nQ11: Frustration that their symptoms aren't taken seriously. This can lead to feeling invalidated, which might worsen their anxiety.\n\nQ12: No self-harm thoughts but fleeting wishes to disappear. This is significant but not suicidal. Still, the distress is notable.\n\nMain symptoms seem to be anxiety-related: social avoidance, panic attacks, physical symptoms, and impairment in work. They might have social anxiety disorder, possibly panic disorder. The patterns show that their anxiety is most triggered by social interactions. \n\nClinical significance includes significant avoidance affecting their job, panic attacks, and physical symptoms. Risk factors include the impact on their occupational functioning and possible under-recognition by others. The wish to disappear, though not suicidal, needs attention to prevent escalation. They might have comorbid conditions like GAD or specific phobias related to social situations. The key is to validate their experiences and consider a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder with panic features.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety/Phobia:** Marked avoidance of social situations, occupational impairment due to avoiding promotions/presentations, and distress related to perceived scrutiny (e.g., trembling, blushing).  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent nervousness, panic attacks (e.g., physical symptoms like tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress), and somatic complaints (headaches, muscle tension).  \n- **Emotional Dysregulation:** Irritability in response to social demands and frustration over rigid planning.  \n- **Perceived Invalidation:** Reports that symptoms are dismissed by others, exacerbating distress.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Social Situations as Trigger:** Symptoms (anhedonia, depression, panic, avoidance) consistently linked to anticipated or actual social interactions.  \n- **Self-Monitoring Preoccupation:** Frequent references to physical manifestations of anxiety (voice trembling, blushing) and fear of being judged.  \n- **Functional Impact:** Avoidance behaviors affecting career progression and social participation.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Core features include avoidance of feared social situations, fear of negative evaluation, and significant impairment.  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic Features:** Panic attacks in social contexts and avoidance of triggering situations (e.g., parties, dates).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive anxiety about social scenarios, accompanied by somatic symptoms.  \n- **Possible Depressive Symptoms:** Mild anhedonia and post-social event dysphoria, though primary distress appears anxiety-driven.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Escalating avoidance may lead to social isolation and occupational stagnation.  \n- **Perceived Invalidity:** Risk of distrust in healthcare providers and nonadherence to treatment.  \n- **Non-Suicidal Distress:** Transient wish to \u201cdisappear\u201d underscores profound emotional distress, requiring monitoring for escalation.  \n\n**5. Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with a cluster of symptoms consistent with **Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23)**, with associated features of **Panic Disorder** (290.80) and somatic anxiety symptoms. Key themes include anticipatory anxiety in social/performance settings, avoidance behaviors impacting occupational functioning, and somatic complaints (e.g., tachycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle tension) linked to social stressors. The patient\u2019s self-reported invalidation by others may contribute to heightened distress. While suicidal ideation is absent, transient wishes to \u201cdisappear\u201d warrant careful monitoring. Further evaluation is needed to assess for comorbid generalized anxiety or depressive features. Clinical priorities include validating symptom severity, addressing avoidance patterns, and assessing for comorbidities.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains. Questions covered depression, anxiety, anger, somatic symptoms, panic, and social anxiety. However, some domains like psychotic symptoms, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, identity and relationships, and substance use were either superficially addressed or not directly explored. For instance, the therapist did not directly inquire about psychotic symptoms or substance use beyond a few questions. Overall, the coverage was good but not exhaustive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. However, there were moments where the questions could have been more precise or detailed. For example, when discussing 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the patient's response hinted at social anxiety rather than anhedonia, but this wasn't further explored with specific follow-up questions. The therapist mostly used clinically relevant language but occasionally used vague terms like 'frustration' instead of 'anger'.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the conversation jumped topics slightly, such as moving from anxiety to panic attacks without fully exploring the patient's feelings of frustration. The therapist mostly maintained a coherent conversational arc but could have ensured smoother transitions and more follow-up questions on critical disclosures.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder were clearly justified by the patient's symptoms and responses. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as avoidance of promotions, anticipatory anxiety, and panic attacks. The reasoning provided was sound and aligned with DSM-5 criteria. The therapist also considered differential diagnoses like Generalized Anxiety Disorder and appropriately contextualized the patient's symptoms within social/performance settings.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and maintained an appropriate professional tone. The use of phrases like 'I want to acknowledge how bravely you've navigated this thus far' demonstrated empathy and understanding.

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong clinical approach, effectively identifying and diagnosing social anxiety and panic disorders. While there were minor omissions in DSM-5 dimension coverage and some questions could have been more precise, the therapist showed empathy and a logical flow in the conversation. The diagnostic justification was robust and aligned with DSM-5 criteria. Overall, the therapist performed well, with minor areas for improvement.",

      "predicted": "Your responses reveal significant distress related to social interactions and the physical and emotional toll they take. It sounds like social situations\u2014whether at work, in relationships, or even casual events\u2014trigger intense anxiety, leaving you feeling trapped between a fear of judgment and a desire to connect. Your descriptions of panic attacks, avoidance of promotions, and the frustration of being misunderstood highlight how deeply this affects your life, and I want to acknowledge how bravely you\u2019ve navigated this thus far.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22)</med>, with associated <med>Panic Disorder</med> features. Symptoms align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD) but are primarily contextualized within social/performance settings.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** The pattern of <sym>avoidance of promotions/presentations</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> around social events, and <sym>somatic symptoms (e.g., trembling, blushing, GI distress)</sym> directly align with <med>SAD</med> criteria. The avoidance of promotions reflects significant life impairment.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** The <sym>panic attacks (e.g., canceling a date due to nausea)</sym> and episodic <sym>cardiovascular/respiratory symptoms</sym> meet criteria for panic episodes, likely tied to social triggers.  \n- **Exclusion of Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Somatic symptoms (headaches, muscle tension) are contextualized as stress-related and tied to social fears, not disproportionate to medical findings.  \n- **GAD vs. SAD:** While generalized anxiety traits exist, they are secondary to social-specific triggers.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Social Anxiety:** Target <sym>safety behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoiding promotions) and social avoidance through exposure-based exercises.  \n2. **Panic Response Management:** Teach grounding techniques to address panic episodes (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, cognitive restructuring for catastrophic thoughts).  \n3. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) or SNRIs to reduce baseline anxiety and panic.  \n4. **Validation-Centered Psychoeducation:** Address feelings of <quote>\"my doctor just told me to relax\"</quote> by normalizing symptoms and emphasizing their biological basis.  \n5. **Workplace Accommodations:** Discuss gradual job-related exposure (e.g., small-group presentations) with an occupational therapist to reduce avoidance.  \n6. **Monitor for Comorbid Issues:** Screen for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> if <sym>anhedonia</sym> or hopelessness worsens, though current presentation is anxiety-driven.",
