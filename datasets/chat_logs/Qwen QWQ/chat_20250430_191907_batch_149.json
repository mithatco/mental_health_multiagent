      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's start by reviewing the user's answers. The user is responding as a patient, and the task is to create a clinical assessment based on their answers. The user provided detailed responses to the 18 questions, and my job is to structure this into the required format.\n\nFirst paragraph needs to be a compassionate summary. I need to highlight their struggles with social situations, anxiety, and the impact on their life. Mention their efforts to cope and the emotional toll.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The most fitting here is Social Anxiety Disorder. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria. The patient's symptoms include fear of social evaluation, avoidance of events, panic attacks, and functional impairment (declining promotions). The somatic symptoms like stomach aches and panic attacks are part of it. There's no mention of trauma, so PTSD isn't a fit. Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't needed here since symptoms are tied to anxiety. So Social Anxiety Disorder is primary. Maybe also consider Panic Disorder as comorbid because of panic attacks.\n\nIn the reasoning, need to tie each symptom to the diagnosis. Avoidance, physiological symptoms, impact on functioning. The repetitive behaviors (like checking texts) might be coping mechanisms but don't meet OCD criteria. No suicidal thoughts, so that's not an issue. The anxiety is specifically social, so GAD is less likely than SAD.\n\nTreatment steps: CBT is the gold standard for SAD. SSRIs are a common medication option. Social support and gradual exposure are important. Addressing the somatic symptoms through mindfulness or relaxation could help. Maybe also mention exploring coping strategies.\n\nWait, in the answers, the user mentioned \"panic attacks\" (Q7) and \"feeling driven to repeat certain actions\" (Q17), like rehearsing or checking texts). But the repetitive behaviors are more about anxiety management rather than OCD. No delusions or hallucinations, so psychosis ruled out.\n\nPutting it all together: The diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder, with possible Panic Disorder. The reasoning should emphasize the social context of symptoms, avoidance patterns, and functional impact. The recommendations will include therapy, medication, and support groups.\n\nMake sure to use the tags correctly. Symptoms like \"panic attacks\" go in <sym>symptom</sym>. The diagnosis names in <med> tags.\n\nDouble-check the structure. The sections must be in order with proper headings. No markdown, just plain text with asterisks. Also, avoid any extra lines between sections.\n\nOkay, time to format the answer step by step, ensuring all points are covered and tags are applied correctly. Make sure the tone is empathetic and professional.\n</think>\n\nYour responses highlight a significant struggle with social interactions, where the weight of fear and self-doubt has become a constant companion. The toll of <sym>avoiding promotions, skipping gatherings, and rehearsing words in your head</sym> speaks to the depth of this challenge. The <sym>physical sensations of panic</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> reveal how your anxiety has shaped your life choices, yet your persistence in engaging in hobbies and answering honestly shows resilience. Your courage to seek understanding is a strong first step toward alleviating this burden.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with <med>Panic Disorder</med> features, and mild <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (pending further evaluation of somatic symptom severity).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** The hallmark features of persistent fear of <sym>negative evaluation</sym>, <sym>avoidance of anxiety-inducing social contexts</sym>, and associated <sym>panic attacks</sym> (e.g., racing heart before speaking) align with DSM-5 criteria. The <sym>functional impairment</sym> (declining promotions, strained relationships) confirms severity.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** Panic attacks (Q7/Q8) tied to social triggers meet criteria, though panic symptoms are secondary to social anxiety.  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** <sym>Unexplained aches</sym> (stomach knots, clammy hands) are likely anxiety-mediated, but further evaluation is needed to ensure no overinterpretation of physical symptoms.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety through exposure exercises, cognitive restructuring of self-judgmental thoughts (\"What if I sound stupid?\"), and gradual exposure to feared situations (e.g., starting with small social interactions).  \n2. **Adjunctive Medication:** Low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) or short-term benzodiazepines for acute panic episodes (if tolerated), to be discussed with a psychiatrist.  \n3. **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction:** Techniques to manage <sym>physical tension</sym> (e.g., deep breathing) and reduce anticipatory worry.  \n4. **Social Skills Training:** Integrate role-playing or group therapy to practice assertive communication and normalize social interactions.  \n5. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Explore if <sym>cultural attitudes</sym> toward vulnerability contribute to your perception of <quote>\"friends saying I\u2019m too sensitive\"</quote>, and address validation in therapy.  \n6. **Monitor Somatic Symptoms:** Rule out medical causes for physical complaints if unexplained (e.g., GI workup for stomach aches), then frame them as anxiety-related if no medical basis found.  \n\nThis approach balances evidence-based interventions with tailored support for your unique challenges, while prioritizing safety and validation of your lived experience.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the patient's answers to the DSM-5 questionnaire and wants a clinical summary. First, I need to go through each answer and pick out the main symptoms. \n\nStarting with Q1: The patient says they don't have much interest in social events but still do hobbies. So that's some anhedonia, but not complete. \n\nQ2 mentions feeling depressed sometimes, especially before work meetings. That's intermittent low mood tied to specific triggers. \n\nQ3: They're not angry but more anxious and a bit short-tempered. So irritability is there but not severe. \n\nQ4: Trouble sleeping but exhausted, so insomnia leading to fatigue. \n\nQ5: Not starting projects or risky behavior, so no signs of mania. \n\nQ6 and Q7 really point to anxiety\u2014nervousness, panic, avoidance. The patient avoids social situations, even turning down promotions. \n\nQ9 and Q10 talk about physical symptoms like stomach aches and clammy hands in social contexts, which are somatic symptoms from anxiety. \n\nQ11 says no self-harm thoughts, so that's a relief. \n\nQ12 and Q13: No psychosis. \n\nQ14: Sleep problems affecting quality. \n\nQ15: Memory issues when anxious\u2014distractibility. \n\nQ16 and Q17: Intrusive thoughts about being judged, and a compulsion to repeat actions. The thoughts are about being judged, which is classic social anxiety. The repetitive checking of texts and rehearsing speech might be mild compulsions, but not full OCD. \n\nQ18's repetition is more about anxiety-driven behaviors. \n\nPutting this together, the main issues are social anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms, and possible mild OCD traits. The pattern is anxiety-driven, particularly in social contexts, leading to functional impairment (like avoiding promotions). \n\nClinical significance: Social Anxiety Disorder is the primary here. The avoidance and panic attacks are key. The somatic symptoms and cognitive distortions (intrusive thoughts) support this. The patient's perception that others dismiss their symptoms adds a layer of invalidation, which can worsen their condition. \n\nRisk factors? No self-harm, so immediate risk is low, but chronic anxiety could lead to more social withdrawal. \n\nI need to structure this into the required sections. Make sure to use clinical terms but stay factual. Avoid speculation, just the facts from their answers. \n\nWait, the patient mentioned \"unpleasant thoughts about being judged\" repeatedly\u2014this is definitely part of social anxiety. The avoidance is impacting their career (turning down promotions), so functional impairment is there. \n\nAlso, the sleep issues and somatic symptoms are part of the anxiety presentation. The compulsions are minor, so maybe note it as repetitive behaviors but not meeting OCD criteria. \n\nOkay, time to format the summary as per the points listed.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent nervousness, panic (elevated heart rate, fear of social scrutiny), and somatic symptoms (stomach aches, clammy hands) in social contexts.  \n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Active avoidance of social situations (e.g., parties, meetings, career advancement opportunities) linked to fear of judgment.  \n- **Low Mood:** Intermittent feelings of depression or hopelessness, triggered by social demands (e.g., work meetings).  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia exacerbated by anticipatory anxiety, leading to fatigue.  \n- **Cognitive Distortions:** Intrusive thoughts of being judged (\"What if I sound stupid?\"), obsessive rumination about social interactions.  \n- **Repetitive Behaviors:** Compensatory actions (e.g., rehearsing conversations, excessive text-checking) to manage anxiety.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms are **socially specific**: anxiety, avoidance, and somatic responses intensify in interpersonal or performance-based contexts.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Anxiety interferes with occupational and social functioning (e.g., declining promotions, withdrawing from relationships).  \n- **Cognitive-emotional cycle**: Anticipatory worry \u2192 somatic symptoms \u2192 avoidance \u2192 reinforced anxiety.  \n- **Validation concerns**: Reports of others dismissing symptoms (\"friends say I\u2019m too sensitive\"), contributing to perceived invalidation.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Core symptoms of fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and functional impairment align with diagnostic criteria.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry about social evaluation, though specificity to social contexts leans more toward SAD.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** Panic attacks in anticipation of social situations (e.g., \"heart races before speaking up\").  \n- **Anxiety-Related Somatic Symptoms:** Gastrointestinal and autonomic arousal (e.g., clammy hands, stomach knots) linked to anxiety triggers.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social Avoidance:** Risk of progressive isolation and occupational stagnation.  \n- **Perceived Stigma:** Internalization of dismissive feedback from others may exacerbate help-seeking barriers.  \n- **No acute self-harm/risk:** Explicit denial of suicidal ideation/plan.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **clinically significant social anxiety disorder**, characterized by marked fear of negative evaluation, anticipatory anxiety, and behavioral avoidance interfering with occupational and social functioning. Associated features include panic symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, somatic distress), cognitive distortions (intrusive self-judgmental thoughts), and mild compensatory repetitive behaviors (text-checking, rumination). There is no evidence of psychotic features or suicidal intent. Risk of functional decline is elevated due to avoidance patterns and perceived invalidation of symptoms by others. Consider differential diagnoses such as panic disorder or specific phobia (social), though the pervasive pattern aligns most closely with SAD. Further assessment should explore symptom duration, onset triggers, and coping strategies.",

      "predicted": "Your responses highlight a significant struggle with social interactions, where the weight of fear and self-doubt has become a constant companion. The toll of <sym>avoiding promotions, skipping gatherings, and rehearsing words in your head</sym> speaks to the depth of this challenge. The <sym>physical sensations of panic</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> reveal how your anxiety has shaped your life choices, yet your persistence in engaging in hobbies and answering honestly shows resilience. Your courage to seek understanding is a strong first step toward alleviating this burden.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with <med>Panic Disorder</med> features, and mild <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (pending further evaluation of somatic symptom severity).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** The hallmark features of persistent fear of <sym>negative evaluation</sym>, <sym>avoidance of anxiety-inducing social contexts</sym>, and associated <sym>panic attacks</sym> (e.g., racing heart before speaking) align with DSM-5 criteria. The <sym>functional impairment</sym> (declining promotions, strained relationships) confirms severity.  \n- **Panic Disorder:** Panic attacks (Q7/Q8) tied to social triggers meet criteria, though panic symptoms are secondary to social anxiety.  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** <sym>Unexplained aches</sym> (stomach knots, clammy hands) are likely anxiety-mediated, but further evaluation is needed to ensure no overinterpretation of physical symptoms.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety through exposure exercises, cognitive restructuring of self-judgmental thoughts (\"What if I sound stupid?\"), and gradual exposure to feared situations (e.g., starting with small social interactions).  \n2. **Adjunctive Medication:** Low-dose SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) or short-term benzodiazepines for acute panic episodes (if tolerated), to be discussed with a psychiatrist.  \n3. **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction:** Techniques to manage <sym>physical tension</sym> (e.g., deep breathing) and reduce anticipatory worry.  \n4. **Social Skills Training:** Integrate role-playing or group therapy to practice assertive communication and normalize social interactions.  \n5. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Explore if <sym>cultural attitudes</sym> toward vulnerability contribute to your perception of <quote>\"friends saying I\u2019m too sensitive\"</quote>, and address validation in therapy.  \n6. **Monitor Somatic Symptoms:** Rule out medical causes for physical complaints if unexplained (e.g., GI workup for stomach aches), then frame them as anxiety-related if no medical basis found.  \n\nThis approach balances evidence-based interventions with tailored support for your unique challenges, while prioritizing safety and validation of your lived experience.",
