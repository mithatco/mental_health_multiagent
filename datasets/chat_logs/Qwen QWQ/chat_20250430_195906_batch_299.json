This is a 23-question assessment about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Your answers will help guide our discussion. Everything you share here is confidential. I'll start by asking each question, and you can describe how much or how often each symptom has bothered you. Take your time, and feel free to elaborate. Ready? Let's begin with the first question."

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through all the patient's responses carefully. The user provided a detailed set of answers to the DSM-5 questions. My task is to analyze these and structure the information into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risk factors, and a summary.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each question and note the key points. The patient mentions loss of interest in hobbies like hiking and reading, which points to anhedonia, a common symptom in depression. They mention moderate frequency for that, but more severe issues in other areas. \n\nFor question 3, the patient reports frequent irritability and anger, almost every day. That's significant because irritability can be part of both anxiety and depressive disorders. The avoidance of social situations (question 8) like skipping a wedding and avoiding crowds suggests possible social anxiety or panic disorder. \n\nThe panic attacks mentioned in question 7 (couple times a week) and daily anxiety symptoms (question 6) with physical sensations like chest tightness and dizziness are classic signs of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder. The physical symptoms in question 10 (aches, pains) are somatic complaints often linked to anxiety, which the patient feels are dismissed by doctors. \n\nSleep disturbances in question 14 (insomnia, waking up at 3 AM) are common in anxiety and depression. Cognitive issues like trouble concentrating (question 16) could be due to anxiety or depressive rumination. \n\nLooking at risk factors, they mention feeling isolated due to avoiding social interactions, which can worsen mental health. They've also had panic attacks but no self-harm (question 11 says no intent to hurt themselves, but they feel anxious when alone). \n\nThe patient's frustration with medical professionals not taking their physical symptoms seriously (question 10 and 11) might indicate a sense of invalidation, which is a risk factor for worsening symptoms. No psychotic symptoms (questions 12 and 13 negative). \n\nNow, the main symptoms would be the anxiety, panic attacks, sleep issues, irritability, somatic symptoms, anhedonia. The patterns are high frequency of anxiety and somatic complaints, avoidance behavior, and the interplay between anxiety and depressive symptoms. \n\nPotential clinical areas: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (given the anhedonia and hopelessness), and possible Adjustment Disorder if there's a stressor. Also, the somatic symptoms might be part of the anxiety or a somatic symptom disorder. \n\nRisk factors: The high level of daily anxiety, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal. The patient's avoidance of social situations is a key concern as it can lead to further isolation. The frustration with medical professionals might affect their treatment adherence. \n\nNeed to avoid mentioning anything not in the responses. No substance use mentioned, so not including that. The summary needs to be concise with DSM-5 terms. \n\nWait, question 4 was about sleep and energy: the patient has insomnia but also fatigue. That's consistent with depression or anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the summary should group these symptoms under appropriate disorders, note the frequency, and highlight the clinical significance like the high anxiety severity, functional impairment from avoidance, and the somatization. The risk factors are the daily anxiety and possible social withdrawal. Make sure not to include anything that's speculative. The user said avoid speculation, so stick strictly to what's presented. \n\nDouble-check each point: the patient denies self-harm, so no suicide risk, but they do mention feeling watched (question 13) which is paranoia but they clarify it's just feeling watched, not actual delusions. So that's not a psychotic symptom but rather a persecutory idea from anxiety. \n\nOkay, I think that's covered. Now structure the answer as per the instructions, using clinical terms, and ensure each section is addressed concisely.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anxiety/Panic Features**: Daily nervousness, anxiety, and somatic symptoms (e.g., trembling hands, chest tightness, dizziness). Panic attacks (2\u20133x/week). Avoidance of social/crowded settings (e.g., skipped wedding).  \n- **Mood Disturbance**: Anhedonia (diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities), intermittent hopelessness, and perceived futility of stressors.  \n- **Irritability/Anger Dysregulation**: Excessive anger outbursts (e.g., snapping at coworkers), described as nearly daily.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance**: Insomnia with middle-of-the-night awakening (3 AM), difficulty maintaining restorative sleep.  \n- **Cognitive Dysfunction**: Concentration difficulties, intrusive ruminations, and cognitive \"freezes\" impairing work/school performance.  \n- **Somatic Symptoms**: Musculoskeletal (shoulder tension) and gastrointestinal (stomach knots) complaints attributed to stress.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Daily High-Intensity Anxiety**: Symptoms of nervousness, fear, and physical tension occur daily, with panic attacks occurring 2\u20133x/week.  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Avoidance of social/occupational obligations (e.g., cancelled plans, work-related distraction).  \n- **Secondary Validation Concerns**: Reports feeling dismissed by medical providers regarding physical symptoms, contributing to frustration.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Persistent anxiety, physical hyperarousal, and excessive worry affecting daily function.  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic Avoidance**: Panic attacks + situational avoidance of anxiety-provoking environments (e.g., crowds).  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Anhedonia, hopelessness, and diminished interest in activities.  \n- **Mixed Anxiety-Depression Presentation**: Overlapping symptoms of anhedonia, irritability, and dysphoria.  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder**: Amplified attention to physical symptoms with perceived under-recognition by others.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **High Anxiety Intensity**: Daily symptoms with escalating avoidance behaviors (social/cognitive withdrawal).  \n- **Irritability**: Potential for interpersonal conflict at work/home.  \n- **Validation Crisis**: Perceived dismissal of concerns by medical providers may exacerbate symptoms or distrust of treatment.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with clinically significant symptoms consistent with a mixed anxiety-depression profile. Core features include nearly daily generalized anxiety with panic attacks (frequency: 2\u20133x/week), anhedonia, irritability/provoked anger, and somatic symptoms (musculoskeletal/gastrointestinal complaints). Sleep disturbance (insomnia with middle insomnia) and cognitive dysfunction (concentration difficulties) further impair functioning. Avoidance of social/occupational stressors suggests agoraphobic tendencies. While no suicidal ideation is reported, the patient\u2019s pervasive anxiety and perceived invalidation by healthcare providers may contribute to escalating distress. Screening supports rule-out of psychotic features (no hallucinations/ideas of reference). Prioritize assessment for GAD, Panic Disorder, and MDD with comorbid somatic symptom disorder. Functional impairment is notable in occupational and interpersonal domains due to avoidance and cognitive blunting.",
