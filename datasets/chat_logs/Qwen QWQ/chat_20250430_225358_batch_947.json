      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by processing the user's responses. The patient is clearly struggling with significant emotional distress. The key points are the loss of pleasure in activities, which is anhedonia, and persistent feelings of hopelessness. They mentioned panic attacks and constant anxiety, which points to an anxiety component. The sleep issues are a mix of insomnia and daytime exhaustion.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the compassionate summary. I should acknowledge their pain and validate their experience. Make sure to include their quotes about losing joy in hobbies and feeling trapped. \n\nNext, the diagnosis. The symptoms align with Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress. The panic attacks could also point to Panic Disorder, but since the depressive symptoms are prominent and the anxiety seems tied to the depression, MDD with anxious distress is primary. The DSM-5 criteria for MDD require at least five symptoms, which they have: anhedonia, depressed mood, insomnia, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness (implied by \"broken\"), and diminished interest. The panic attacks might be part of the anxious distress specifier. \n\nThe reasoning needs to connect the symptoms to the diagnosis, mentioning the DSM-5 criteria. Also, note the exclusion of other disorders like bipolar (since no manic/hypomanic symptoms) or PTSD (no trauma mentioned here, though maybe not ruled out entirely). But the primary issue here is the depression with anxiety features.\n\nNext steps should include evaluation for suicidal ideation (since they mentioned feeling \"broken\"), therapy options like CBT, medication consideration (SSRIs), and addressing sleep disturbances. Also, ruling out medical causes for sleep issues. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"feeling broken\" which could be a suicide risk indicator. Need to check if there's any mention of suicidal thoughts. They didn't explicitly state it, so maybe recommend assessing that next. \n\nI need to structure all this into the required sections with the tags. Make sure not to use markdown except for the specified tags. Also, follow the exact headings with asterisks. Check DSM-5 criteria for MDD and anxious distress. The patient's panic attacks could also meet Panic Disorder, but as part of the depressive episode's anxious distress. \n\nAvoid mentioning Somatic Symptom Disorder unless the symptoms fit, which they don't here. The symptoms point more to depression and anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis section should list MDD with anxious distress and possible Panic Disorder. The reasoning will connect the symptoms to the criteria. The next steps must include immediate actions like safety assessment, therapy, medication, and sleep hygiene. \n\nMake sure the tags are correctly placed: medical terms in <med>, symptoms in <sym>, and quotes in <quote>. Also, ensure the sections are in order without extra lines.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a patient's responses to a questionnaire based on the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. My task is to analyze these answers and structure the summary as per the instructions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms from each answer. Let's go through each Q&A pair:\n\nQ1 (Anhedonia): The patient mentions lack of interest/pleasure in hobbies, which is classic anhedonia. It's been worsening weekly. That's a key depressive symptom.\n\nQ2 (Depressed mood): They talk about feeling trapped in a fog, panic attacks, and hopelessness. The \"broken\" comment might indicate worthlessness, another depressive sign. Also mentions panic attacks, which are anxiety-related.\n\nQ3 (Irritability vs. fear): They mention being irritable only during panic attacks, but mostly fear. So primary is anxiety, not irritability.\n\nQ4 (Sleep disturbance): Insomnia with nighttime wakefulness and daytime exhaustion. Not the manic-type sleeplessness, more like insomnia common in depression/anxiety.\n\nQ5 (Activity level): Avoidance, social withdrawal, stopping activities. This is behavioral withdrawal, pointing to depression or anxiety exacerbation.\n\nQ6 (Anxiety symptoms): Constant nervousness, feeling on edge, physical symptoms (heart racing). High baseline anxiety with panic attacks.\n\nNow, the main symptoms are anhedonia, depressed mood with hopelessness, panic attacks, sleep disturbance, social withdrawal, and constant anxiety. \n\nLooking for patterns: Symptoms have been worsening over two weeks (as per the questionnaire's timeframe). The escalation in severity, especially anhedonia getting worse weekly, is a pattern. Also, the presence of both depressive and anxiety symptoms (comorbidities). The panic attacks seem to trigger irritability, showing a link between anxiety episodes and behavioral responses.\n\nClinical significance areas: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, Panic Disorder, or maybe an Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depression. The high anxiety and panic attacks need attention. The sleep issues could be related to either, but often seen in both. The hopelessness in Q2 is a red flag for possible suicidal ideation, though it's not explicitly stated. The behavioral withdrawal (Q5) is a significant impairment in functioning.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs: The patient's hopelessness and feeling \"broken\" could indicate suicidal thoughts. They mention panic attacks, which are distressing and impairing. The withdrawal from activities suggests social isolation, which is a risk factor for worsening symptoms. However, the user didn't mention any direct suicidal intent, so I shouldn't assume that without evidence. The constant anxiety and panic attacks are definitely concerning.\n\nNow, structuring the summary in clinical terms without speculation. Need to be precise, no assumptions beyond what's stated.\n\nMain symptoms and concerns: Anhedonia, depressed mood with hopelessness, anxiety symptoms (nervousness, feeling on edge, physical sensations like heart racing), panic attacks, sleep disturbances (insomnia and hypersomnia?), but the patient says they can't sleep at night but are exhausted during the day. Wait, the answer says \"either wide awake at 3 AM or exhausted during the day.\" So insomnia at night and hypersomnia-like during day? Or is it just insomnia with daytime fatigue? Either way, significant sleep disruption.\n\nPatterns: Gradual worsening of anhedonia over two weeks. Comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Panic attacks triggering irritability. \n\nClinical significance: Likely MDD with anxious distress, possible Panic Disorder. The combination of both. The functional impairment from withdrawal and panic attacks. \n\nRisk factors: The hopelessness and feeling \"broken\" should be probed further for suicidal ideation. Avoidance behavior leading to social isolation. The constant panic and anxiety could lead to increased functional impairment.\n\nPutting this into the required sections. Need to make sure not to mention suicide unless it's there. The user didn't report it, so stick to what's present. \n\nAlso, note the sleep issue as non-restorative sleep, which is a common depressive symptom. The hyperarousal (feeling on edge) is part of anxiety. \n\nOkay, time to structure each part as per the points. Let me make sure all points are covered without adding anything not there. Avoid terms like \"maybe\" or \"could be\", be factual.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anhedonia**: Marked reduction in interest/pleasure in activities (e.g., reading, walking), worsening over the past two weeks.  \n- **Depressed Mood/Anxiety Comorbidity**: Persistent feelings of hopelessness, entrapment, and panic attacks. Reports of a pervasive \"fog\" and self-perceived \"brokenness.\"  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms**: Chronic nervousness, feeling \"on edge,\" and physical hyperarousal (e.g., racing heart). Panic attacks occur in public settings, exacerbating social avoidance.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance**: Insomnia (awakening at 3 AM) and hypersomnia (exhaustion during daytime), suggestive of non-restorative sleep.  \n- **Behavioral Withdrawal**: Social isolation, avoidance of activities, and cancellations of plans.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Temporal Worsening**: Symptoms (anhedonia, anxiety, hopelessness) have progressively intensified over the past two weeks.  \n- **Interconnected Symptoms**: Panic attacks appear to trigger irritability and avoidance behaviors, while depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low energy) further limit functional capacity.  \n- **Psychosocial Impact**: Significant impairment in daily functioning (e.g., withdrawal from hobbies, social isolation).  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Anxiety/Depression Comorbidity**: Symptoms align with **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress** and **Panic Disorder**.  \n- **Psychomotor Agitation/Retardation**: Mixed reports of insomnia with daytime fatigue suggest possible psychomotor agitation (restlessness at night) and retardation (low energy during the day).  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Withdrawal and avoidance behaviors indicate severe interference with occupational/social roles.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Hopelessness**: Expressions of entrapment and perceived \"brokenness\" may signal suicidal ideation risk (requires direct inquiry).  \n- **Panic Attacks**: Recurrent and disabling episodes, contributing to social withdrawal and avoidance.  \n- **Social Isolation**: Increased vulnerability to exacerbation of symptoms and reduced coping resources.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **prolonged anhedonia**, **depressive symptoms** (hopelessness, low energy), and **anxiety features** (panic attacks, hyperarousal). Comorbid anxiety and depression are evident, with marked functional impairment due to social withdrawal and sleep disruption. **Key red flags** include escalating hopelessness and panic-induced avoidance, warranting urgent assessment of suicidal ideation and safety planning. Prioritize evaluation of **MDD with anxious distress** and **Panic Disorder**, alongside sleep and anxiety symptom management.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Loss of pleasure</sym> in activities once cherished, the <sym>heavy fog</sym> of hopelessness, and the relentless <sym>panic attacks</sym> paint a picture of profound emotional distress. The exhaustion of staying <quote>\"awake at 3 AM\"</quote> and the paralyzing fear of daily interactions convey a life curtailed by <sym>debilitating anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>. This is a call for compassionate support to break the cycle of avoidance and isolation.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with prominent <sym>anxious distress</sym> (provisional: <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> pending further evaluation).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **MDD with Anxious Distress**: <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor agitation (insomnia, hyperarousal)</sym> meet DSM-5 criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The <sym>worsening symptoms over two weeks</sym> and <sym>marked functional impairment</sym> (e.g., social withdrawal) further support this. The <sym>anxious distress specifier</sym> is confirmed by <sym>worry about panic attacks</sym> and <sym>physiological hyperarousal</sym>.  \n- **Panic Disorder**: Recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance of triggers</sym> align with diagnostic criteria, though this may be secondary to the depressive episode.  \n- **Exclusions**: No manic/hypomanic symptoms rule out <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>; grief is absent as a primary cause (no bereavement noted).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Safety Assessment**:  \n   - Evaluate for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (given <quote>\"broken\"</quote> self-perception). Use tools like the PHQ-9 or Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.  \n\n2. **Multi-modal Treatment Initiation**:  \n   - Start <med>SSRI/SNRI</med> (e.g., escitalopram) for both depressive and anxious symptoms.  \n   - Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> (e.g., \"I\u2019m broken\").  \n   - Address <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> with sleep hygiene education and consider <med>low-dose melatonin</med> or TCA (e.g., trazodone) if insomnia persists.  \n\n3. **Functional Restoration**:  \n   - Gradual social re-engagement through <med>exposure-based therapy</med> to counteract avoidance.  \n   - Daily activity scheduling to combat <sym>anhedonia</sym> (e.g., brief structured routines).  \n\n4. **Medical Workup**:  \n   - Rule out <med>medical causes</med> (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, chronic illness) for <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.  \n\n5. **Regular Monitoring**:  \n   - Weekly follow-ups to track <sym>mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and medication response.  \n\nThis approach addresses the interplay of <med>mood</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med> while prioritizing safety and functional recovery.",
