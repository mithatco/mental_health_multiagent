      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the response according to the user's strict format. Let me start by summarizing the patient's situation with empathy. I'll make sure to highlight their struggles with panic attacks and avoidance.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The key symptoms are recurrent panic attacks and avoidance, so the primary diagnosis should be Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. The user mentioned that the DSM-5 criteria changed for PTSD, but the symptoms here don't fit PTSD's trauma exposure requirement. The panic attacks' frequency and avoidance behaviors align more with Panic Disorder.\n\nIn the reasoning section, I'll connect the panic attacks (symptoms like chest pain, hypervigilance) and the agoraphobic avoidance. The patient's avoidance of places where escape might be difficult (like subways) is a classic sign of agoraphobia. Also, the emotional distress and functional impairment from avoiding social events supports this. They don't show depressive features severe enough for a full MDD diagnosis, so it's more anxiety-driven.\n\nFor next steps, the recommendations should include CBT for panic disorder, possible SSRIs, tracking symptoms, medical follow-up (since they mentioned chest pain even if it's anxiety-related), and social support. Need to list them as numbered points in the specified tags.\n\nI have to ensure all medical terms are in <med> tags: like Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, CBT, SSRIs. Symptoms like panic attacks, chest pain, avoidance. Quotes like \"what if I can\u2019t stop feeling this way?\" go in quotes. \n\nCheck the structure: first paragraph, then each section with exact headings. No markdown, just the specified tags. Make sure to follow all the formatting rules precisely. Avoid mentioning things not in the responses. Stick strictly to the information given. Make sure the diagnosis is first, then the reasoning based on DSM-5 criteria. Also, ensure that the treatment steps are actionable and specific.\n</think>\n\nYou\u2019ve described a deeply distressing experience marked by overwhelming panic, constant anxiety, and a growing sense of being trapped by your symptoms. Your vivid descriptions of panic attacks\u2014<sym>chest tightness, racing heart, fear of losing control</sym>\u2014along with your efforts to avoid situations that trigger these feelings, reflect immense courage in facing this struggle. It\u2019s clear how much these symptoms are limiting your life, from hiking trails to family gatherings. You\u2019re not alone in this; these experiences are part of a recognizable pattern that responds well to treatment.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic Features</med>  \n**Reasoning:**  \nThe constellation of <sym>recurrent panic attacks</sym> (4\u20135 episodes in two weeks, with autonomic arousal: tachycardia, dizziness, <sym>chest pain</sym>), coupled with marked avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult (e.g., crowded places, driving), aligns with <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>. The <sym>intermittent hopelessness</sym> and anhedonia (<quote>\u201cwhat if I can\u2019t stop feeling this way?\u201d</quote>) are better explained by anxiety-driven catastrophizing rather than major depression, given the absence of core depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent guilt, weight change, vegetative slowing). The avoidance behavior and physical symptoms during panic episodes meet DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting panic disorder, with a focus on exposure therapy to address avoidance behaviors.  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy**: Short-term use of <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) for acute panic episodes, with close monitoring.  \n3. **Daily symptom tracking**: Use a panic/avoidance journal to identify triggers and measure treatment response.  \n4. **Medical recheck**: Ensure no cardiac/respiratory issues (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, arrhythmia) are contributing to somatic symptoms.  \n5. **Social support**: Engage in gradual re-engagement with low-stress activities (e.g., short walks) to rebuild tolerance.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided patient responses from a DSM-5 cross-cutting symptom measure. I need to analyze this as a mental health professional. First, I'll go through each question and note the key points.\n\nStarting with Q1: The patient mentions avoiding places where they had panic attacks, like hiking. That points to avoidance behavior, which is a big deal. They also express uncertainty about their condition, which is common in anxiety disorders.\n\nQ3: They mention feeling down but not hopeless all the time. The intermittent hopelessness is notable. They're worried it won't end, indicating some distress but maybe not full depression.\n\nQ4: They sleep too much, which is different from insomnia. Hypersomnia is a sign, but I should check if it's related to anxiety or depression.\n\nQ6: They don't have increased energy, so probably not manic or hypomanic. The aversion to projects suggests anhedonia or anxiety-driven avoidance.\n\nQ7 and Q8 are particularly relevant. The patient describes daily anxiety, panic attacks 4-5 times in two weeks, and avoidance of situations. The physical symptoms like chest pain and dizziness are part of panic attacks. The avoidance of places they can't escape quickly points to possible agoraphobia. The headaches before attacks might be tension-related.\n\nThe main symptoms seem to revolve around panic attacks with physical symptoms, avoidance, and anxiety. The pattern is chronic anxiety with acute panic episodes and behavioral changes. Risk factors include the frequency and severity of panic attacks, avoidance leading to functional impairment, and possible development of agoraphobia. They also mention starting to avoid family events, which affects social functioning. The physical symptoms are significant but seem to align with panic disorder, so maybe not another condition unless there's something else. Need to rule out cardiac issues, but the doc already checked, so probably okay. The intermittent hopelessness could be part of the anxiety or depressive symptoms, but not enough for a depression diagnosis yet. The key here is panic disorder with agoraphobic features. The summary should note the panic attacks' frequency, avoidance, physical symptoms, and the impact on daily life. Also, the risk of worsening if not addressed. Make sure not to mention things not in the responses, like suicidal thoughts unless present. Stick to what's given. Clinical terms like \"avoidant behavior,\" \"panic attacks with somatic symptoms,\" etc. should be used. Okay, structure the response as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- Recurrent panic attacks (4\u20135 episodes in 2 weeks) with somatic symptoms (chest tightness, tachycardia, dizziness, tremors).  \n- Anxiety symptoms: chronic hypervigilance, irritability (triggered by startle responses), and persistent feeling of being \"on edge.\"  \n- Avoidant behavior (e.g., avoiding hiking, crowded places, driving, social gatherings) consistent with anticipatory anxiety and agoraphobic tendencies.  \n- Anhedonia (diminished pleasure in previously enjoyed activities like hiking).  \n- Sleep disturbance (excessive daytime fatigue, nighttime hyperarousal interfering with sleep).  \n- Subjective fear of persistent symptoms (\"what if I can\u2019t stop feeling this way?\").  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Temporal consistency**: Symptoms (panic attacks, avoidance, anxiety) have been escalating over the past two weeks, with no reported improvement.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance of activities and social interactions has led to withdrawal (e.g., skipping family events).  \n- **Autonomic hyperarousal**: Physical symptoms (tachycardia, tremors, chest pain) are exclusively tied to anxiety/panic episodes rather than independent somatic pathology.  \n- **Emotional dysregulation**: Alternating between exhaustion and hyperarousal, with transient hopelessness but no persistent nihilism.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- Panic Disorder with agoraphobia (consistent with DSM-5 criteria: recurrent panic attacks + fear/avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult).  \n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) features (persistent worry, restlessness, fatigue).  \n- Mixed anxiety-depression presentation (intermittent hopelessness, anhedonia, but without full depressive symptom clusters.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Avoidance reinforcement cycle**: Escalating situational avoidance risks social/occupational withdrawal.  \n- **Physical symptom misinterpretation**: Chest pain/heart palpitations may exacerbate fear of medical illness, worsening anxiety.  \n- **Functional decline**: Reduced engagement in meaningful activities (hiking, socializing) suggests decreased quality of life.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary (Professional Terminology)**  \nThe patient presents with acute distress dominated by **recurrent panic attacks with somatic symptoms** (elevated heart rate, chest pain, dizziness) and **avoidant behavior** consistent with **panic disorder with agoraphobic features**. Secondary **anxiety-driven hypoarousal** (excessive sleep, anhedonia) and **autonomic hyperarousal** (tremor, tachycardia) are prominent. The patient reports transient **negative cognitive distortions** (e.g., \"what if I can\u2019t stop feeling this way?\"), reflecting **catastrophizing**. No acute suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms are noted.  \n\n**Recommendations**: Prioritize panic disorder with agoraphobic features in differential diagnosis. Rule out medical etiologies (e.g., cardiac, thyroid) for somatic symptoms. Consider CBT for panic disorder with exposure therapy, anxiolytics if indicated, and assessment of depression severity. Monitor functional impairment due to avoidance.  \n\n---  \n*Note: This summary is provisional and requires further clinical evaluation (e.g., PHQ-9/GAD-7 for severity, substance use history, trauma history, and physical health review).*",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve described a deeply distressing experience marked by overwhelming panic, constant anxiety, and a growing sense of being trapped by your symptoms. Your vivid descriptions of panic attacks\u2014<sym>chest tightness, racing heart, fear of losing control</sym>\u2014along with your efforts to avoid situations that trigger these feelings, reflect immense courage in facing this struggle. It\u2019s clear how much these symptoms are limiting your life, from hiking trails to family gatherings. You\u2019re not alone in this; these experiences are part of a recognizable pattern that responds well to treatment.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic Features</med>  \n**Reasoning:**  \nThe constellation of <sym>recurrent panic attacks</sym> (4\u20135 episodes in two weeks, with autonomic arousal: tachycardia, dizziness, <sym>chest pain</sym>), coupled with marked avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult (e.g., crowded places, driving), aligns with <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>. The <sym>intermittent hopelessness</sym> and anhedonia (<quote>\u201cwhat if I can\u2019t stop feeling this way?\u201d</quote>) are better explained by anxiety-driven catastrophizing rather than major depression, given the absence of core depressive symptoms (e.g., persistent guilt, weight change, vegetative slowing). The avoidance behavior and physical symptoms during panic episodes meet DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting panic disorder, with a focus on exposure therapy to address avoidance behaviors.  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy**: Short-term use of <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) for acute panic episodes, with close monitoring.  \n3. **Daily symptom tracking**: Use a panic/avoidance journal to identify triggers and measure treatment response.  \n4. **Medical recheck**: Ensure no cardiac/respiratory issues (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, arrhythmia) are contributing to somatic symptoms.  \n5. **Social support**: Engage in gradual re-engagement with low-stress activities (e.g., short walks) to rebuild tolerance.",
