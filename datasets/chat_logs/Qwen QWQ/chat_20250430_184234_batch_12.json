      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the response exactly as the user specified. Let me start with the compassionate summary. The user mentioned feeling disconnected after divorce, so I should highlight their struggles with empathy.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The symptoms fit Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress. The DSM-5 criteria include depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep issues, and anxiety. The adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood might also apply due to the divorce stressor. The patient's passive suicidal ideation and anxiety symptoms support the anxious distress specifier.\n\nFor reasoning, I have to explain each part. The depressive symptoms are clear: anhedonia, low energy, hopelessness. The anxiety features like panic and avoidance point to the anxious distress. The adjustment disorder is tied to the divorce as a stressor. No signs of mania or psychosis, so bipolar is unlikely. The somatic symptoms are linked to anxiety/depression, so SSD isn't primary.\n\nNext steps: therapy (CBT for anxiety and CBT for depression), monitoring for alcohol use as a coping mechanism, medical check for somatic issues, and social support. \n\nI need to use the tags properly: medical terms in <med>, symptoms in <sym>, and quotes as needed. Check the order of sections and formatting. Make sure to avoid any markdown except the specified tags. Also, ensure all sections are present without extra text. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\nYou\u2019ve described a deeply challenging time marked by profound sadness, loss of joy, and a sense of disconnection since your divorce. Your struggle to find purpose, the overwhelming anxiety that leaves you stuck at home, and the physical toll of headaches and nausea all underscore how deeply this period has impacted your life. It\u2019s clear how exhausting it must feel to carry this weight alone, and your honesty about wanting to \u201cdisappear\u201d highlights the depth of your emotional pain. You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014you deserve support to navigate these challenges.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood</med>  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s anhedonia (<sym>little interest in activities</sym>), depressed mood (<sym>feeling \"heavy\" and hopeless</sym>), marked anxiety (<sym>racing thoughts, panic attacks</sym>), and functional impairment (<sym>avoiding social interactions, work conflicts</sym>) meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the patient's responses to the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and wants me to generate a clinical summary. First, I need to read through all the Q&As carefully to pick up on the key points.\n\nStarting with Q1 about little interest or pleasure\u2014patient mentions loss of motivation, which is anhedonia, a common depressive symptom. Q2 confirms depressed mood. Then Q4 asks about sleep; the patient says they're sleeping too much but it's not restful. Wait, Q5 is about increased activity or risk-taking, and they said no, so that's important because hypomania might be ruled out here. \n\nQ6: Anxiety is high, with racing thoughts and worst-case scenarios. That's anxiety disorder symptoms. Q7 mentions panic attacks a few times. Avoidance in Q9\u2014staying home to avoid grocery stores, which is avoidance behavior, maybe social anxiety or agoraphobia. \n\nPhysical symptoms like headaches and nausea in Q10, but they don't feel their concerns are taken seriously (Q11 says no, but maybe they feel dismissed in other contexts). \n\nSuicidal thoughts in Q12 are passive ideation (wishing to disappear but not actively planning). No psychosis (Q13 and 14 deny voices or delusions). \n\nSleep issues again in Q15, along with cognitive problems like memory issues and getting lost\u2014this could be cognitive fog related to depression or anxiety. \n\nQ16 and 17 mention intrusive thoughts and lack of compulsive behaviors\u2014maybe OCD? But they don't do rituals, so maybe intrusive thoughts without compulsions. \n\nDepersonalization/derealization in Q18 (feeling detached) and identity confusion in Q19 (not knowing who they are post-divorce). Social withdrawal in Q20, which is part of depression. \n\nSubstance use in Q21 mentions increased alcohol use, which is a risk factor. But Q22 and 23 say no to tobacco and drugs except prescribed sleep meds, which are used correctly. \n\nPutting this together, the main symptoms are anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, passive suicidal ideation, social withdrawal, and alcohol use. The divorce is a significant stressor. \n\nPatterns: The patient is experiencing a mix of depressive, anxiety, and possible adjustment disorder symptoms. The high anxiety (Q6-8, 10, 16) and depressive symptoms (Q1-2, 4, 20-21) are prominent. The cognitive issues (memory, wayfinding) might be due to depression or anxiety affecting concentration. The intrusive thoughts about the divorce could be linked to adjustment disorder. \n\nClinical significance includes major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. The passive suicidal ideation (wish to disappear) needs attention, though no active plan. The alcohol use is a coping mechanism, so possible substance use as a comorbidity. \n\nRisk factors: Recent divorce as a stressor, passive SI, increased alcohol use. Need to monitor for escalation of SI or substance use. The cognitive issues and somatic symptoms (headaches, nausea) should be addressed to rule out medical causes, but seem linked to psychological distress. \n\nWait, they mentioned somatic symptoms (Q9 and 10) but denied feeling their illnesses are dismissed (Q11 was a 0, so maybe they feel their physical symptoms aren't taken seriously by others, but they don't think their physical issues are actual medical. That could be somatic symptoms disorder, but need more info. \n\nAlso, the identity confusion (Q19) and detachment (Q18) could indicate depersonalization disorder or part of the depressive symptoms. \n\nPutting all this into the required sections: the main symptoms are depressive and anxiety symptoms, the patterns are high anxiety and low energy, clinical significance in mood and anxiety disorders, risk factors include alcohol use and passive SI. \n\nNeed to structure this into the five points the user asked for, using clinical terms without jargon. Make sure to avoid speculation, just state what's observed. \n\nCheck if I missed anything. The patient mentioned sleeping too much (Q4), which is hypersomnia, common in atypical depression. The irritability (Q3) could be part of depression or anxiety. The avoidance (Q9) is a key anxiety symptom. \n\nAlright, time to structure the answer step by step as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Depressive symptoms**:** Anhedonia (Q1), depressed mood (Q2), hypersomnia (Q4), psychomotor retardation (via reported lack of motivation), and impaired social/role functioning (Q20-21).  \n- **Anxiety symptoms:** Excessive worry/panic (Q6-8), somatic symptoms (headaches, gastrointestinal distress; Q9-10), intrusive ruminations (Q16), and avoidance behaviors (Q9).  \n- **Cognitive disturbances:** Executive dysfunction (Q15: memory/concentration issues, decision-making difficulties), and identity disturbance (Q19-20).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Mixed mood and anxiety profile:** Elevated depressive and anxious symptoms co-occurring with significant somatic and cognitive dysregulation.  \n- **Stressor-related content:** Recurring references to divorce (Q16-17, 19-20) as a precipitant to current distress.  \n- **Functional impairment:** Avoidance of social obligations (Q20-21), work relationship conflicts (Q3-4), and impaired occupational focus (Q15-16).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Anhedonia, mood symptoms, and somatic complaints.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive worry, restlessness, and avoidance behaviors.  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood:** Symptom onset after divorce (Q16-19).  \n- **Substance Use Concern:** Increased alcohol consumption (Q21) as a potential maladaptive coping mechanism.  \n- **Neurocognitive Symptoms:** Possible attention/memory deficits (Q15-16) requiring further evaluation.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Passive suicidal ideation:** Non-suicidal wish to \"disappear\" (Q11) requires collateral assessment.  \n- **Maladaptive coping:** Escalating alcohol use (Q21) despite no active substance dependence.  \n- **Social withdrawal:** Avoidance of relationships and responsibilities (Q20-21), increasing isolation risk.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with a constellation of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low energy, cognitive slowing) and anxious arousal (intrusive thoughts, somatic symptoms, avoidance). Psychosocial stressors (divorce) appear to exacerbate current distress. Passive suicidal ideation without plan, increased alcohol use, and functional impairment (occupational/interpersonal) highlight clinical urgency. Cognitive and somatic symptoms warrant further evaluation to rule out medical contributors. A provisional diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features and Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct is suggested. Risk factors include social withdrawal and maladaptive coping, necessitating close monitoring for symptom escalation.",

Your struggle to find purpose, the overwhelming anxiety that leaves you stuck at home, and the physical toll of headaches and nausea all underscore how deeply this period has impacted your life. It\u2019s clear how exhausting it must feel to carry this weight alone, and your honesty about wanting to \u201cdisappear\u201d highlights the depth of your emotional pain. You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014you deserve support to navigate these challenges.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood</med>  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s anhedonia (<sym>little interest in activities</sym>), depressed mood (<sym>feeling \"heavy\" and hopeless</sym>), marked anxiety (<sym>racing thoughts, panic attacks</sym>), and functional impairment (<sym>avoiding social interactions, work conflicts</sym>) meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>excessive anxiety about possible negative outcomes</sym> and <sym>physiological arousal</sym> warrant the <med>Anxious Distress Specifier</med>. The divorce (<quote>\"not knowing who I am anymore\"</quote>) directly precedes and exacerbates symptoms, supporting <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>. No manic/hypomanic features (<sym>denies increased activity/risk-taking</sym>) exclude <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. Somatic symptoms (<sym>headaches, nausea</sym>) align with psychological distress rather than somatic preoccupation, making <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> less likely.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target <sym>intrusive thoughts about divorce</sym> and avoidance patterns. CBT can address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. **Medication evaluation:** Trial of a <med>SSRI</med> (e.g., escitalopram) to address depression and anxious arousal. Monitor for activation.  \n3. **Substance use monitoring:** Track alcohol use (<quote>\"a whole bottle of wine\"</quote>) and consider harm-reduction strategies if escalation occurs.  \n4. **Medical workup:** Rule out thyroid dysfunction or vitamin deficiencies contributing to <sym>cognitive fog</sym> and fatigue.  \n5. **Social support planning:** Gradual re-engagement in relationships via small social goals (e.g., attending one friend check-in weekly).  \n6. **Sleep hygiene intervention:** Address <sym>non-restorative sleep</sym> with structured bedtime routines and light therapy for hypersomnia.",
