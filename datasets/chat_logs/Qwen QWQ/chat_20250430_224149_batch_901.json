      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user provided the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire and wants a structured assessment following specific formatting rules. First, I need to parse the answers to identify key symptoms and patterns.\n\nStarting with the patient's answers, they mentioned avoiding social interactions due to fear of judgment, panic attacks in social settings, physical symptoms like migraines, and significant work avoidance. They also expressed anxiety about being judged, which suggests social anxiety. The panic attacks during social events point towards panic disorder with social triggers. The depersonalization during events indicates possible dissociative reactions. The patient also downplays their struggles, showing underreporting due to fear of stigma. \n\nThe user emphasized using the exact structure: compassionate summary, diagnosis with reasoning, and next steps. I must ensure all sections are present and formatted correctly. Tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes are required. The diagnosis should align with DSM-5 criteria. \n\nLooking at the instructions, I need to consider differential diagnoses. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is primary here. Panic Disorder with social triggers is secondary. The depersonalation and dissociation during anxiety could be linked to SAD, but maybe rule out PTSD or Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. The Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't primary here since symptoms are tied to anxiety. \n\nNext steps should include CBT for social anxiety, possibly with exposure therapy. Medication like SSRIs might be considered. Addressing dissociation could involve grounding techniques. Addressing stigma fears is important for engagement. \n\nWait, the user specified to avoid overstepping and stick to presented symptoms. The depersonalization is mentioned, so note that in the diagnosis. The patient's self-criticism and avoidance fit SAD. Panic attacks are part of that. The dissociation could be a dissociative response to anxiety, not necessarily a separate disorder unless more severe. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis should be Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with panic attacks and features of generalized anxiety. The dissociation is noted but not a separate diagnosis unless more data. \n\nNow, structure the response with the required sections. Use the tags correctly. Make sure the summary shows empathy, the diagnosis is clear with reasoning, and the next steps are actionable. Check for all formatting requirements and tags. Avoid any markdown except the specified tags. Alright, time to draft the response.\n</think>\n\nThe patient described a profound struggle with **social interactions driven by fear of judgment**, leading to avoidance that limits career and relational opportunities. <sym>Insomnia</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>dissociation during high-anxiety moments</sym> reflect the toll of persistent anxiety.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire, and I need to analyze them according to the specified points. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms and concerns. Looking at the answers, the patient talks about avoiding social situations, anxiety, panic attacks, physical symptoms like migraines and nausea, and self-doubt. They mention feeling detached during social events and a fear of judgment. They also have sleep issues related to anxiety. \n\nNext, I should note the patterns. The patient consistently references social situations as a trigger for their symptoms. There's a recurring theme of fear of judgment and embarrassment, which leads to avoidance. They also express a lot of self-criticism and a sense of being stuck in a cycle, which might indicate rumination.\n\nFor potential clinical areas, social anxiety disorder comes to mind because of the avoidance and distress in social settings. The panic attacks and physical symptoms could point towards panic disorder, but since the panic is tied to social contexts, maybe it's part of the social anxiety. The compulsive checking of appearance might suggest some OCD traits, but the patient downplays it. The detachment and feeling \"in a movie\" could be depersonalization, often linked to anxiety. The self-doubt and ruminations about being judged might also touch on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The mention of not wanting to seem ungrateful when discussing symptoms could indicate a fear of being judged even in medical settings, possibly leading to underreporting. \n\nRisk factors: The patient mentions passive thoughts about wanting to be invisible, but denies actual self-harm. They do express feeling low after avoiding things, which could be a depressive element. But they downplay the depression aspect. The social withdrawal might be isolating them, which could be a risk for worsening symptoms. The fact that they haven't acted on the passive thoughts is important, but it's still a concern. There's no mention of substance use or other risk factors, so maybe that's not here. \n\nClinical significance points: The primary issue seems to be social anxiety with significant impairment. The avoidance is affecting their career (turning down promotions), which is a major functional impact. The physical symptoms (migraines, GI issues) are linked to anxiety, so that's somatic. The cognitive symptoms like rumination and self-criticism are key. The panic attacks are specific to social triggers, so that's part of social anxiety. The checking behavior (outfit checks) might be a safety behavior but not meeting OCD criteria yet. The depersonalization is a dissociative response to stress. The patient's underreporting due to fear of being judged could be a barrier to treatment. The passive ideation is a minor red flag but not active suicidal intent.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required sections without speculation. Make sure to use clinical terms: social anxiety disorder, panic disorder with social triggers, depersonalization, GAD features, possible avoidance as a safety behavior, somatic symptoms. Also note the functional impairment in career and relationships. The risk factors: passive ideation, possible underreporting due to fear of stigma, and maybe some depressive symptoms but not primary.\n\nWait, the patient downplays the depressive symptoms saying they're not depressed, but does the feeling of being 'low' after avoiding things count as depressive? Maybe mild depressive symptoms but not the primary issue. The main issue is anxiety-related. The key points are social anxiety with panic attacks, avoidance leading to impairment, somatic symptoms, cognitive distortions, and some dissociative responses. \n\nI should avoid assuming disorders and stick to what's presented. The summary needs to be concise. Let me structure each part accordingly.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n#### 1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social anxiety/avoidance**: Marked avoidance of social interactions (e.g., skipping events, declining promotions) due to fear of judgment, embarrassment, or perceived scrutiny.  \n- **Anxiety and panic symptoms**: Persistent anxiety, physical symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, sweating, migraines), and panic attacks in social contexts (e.g., leaving networking events due to autonomic arousal).  \n- **Cognitive distortions**: Intrusive self-critical thoughts (e.g., \"sounding stupid,\" \"messed up meetings\"), rumination, and obsessive worry about social performance.  \n- **Psychophysiological symptoms**: Insomnia secondary to preoccupation with social stressors, somatic complaints (e.g., stomach knots, sweating), and dissociative detachment during anxious moments (e.g., \"watching myself in a movie\").  \n- **Self-stigma and underreporting**: Fear of being perceived as \"overreacting\" or dismissed by others, leading to concealment of symptoms (e.g., attributing panic to stress, minimizing severity).  \n\n#### 2. **Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Social context as a primary trigger**: Symptoms (anxiety, avoidance, panic) consistently arise in anticipation of or during social evaluations.  \n- **Self-criticism and fear of judgment**: Recurrent references to internalized shame (\"my inner critic,\" \"feeling stuck in a cycle\"), with efforts to downplay struggles (\"I don\u2019t want anyone to notice\").  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance behaviors impact career advancement (e.g., declining promotions) and social engagement, contributing to perceived isolation.  \n- **Cognitive-behavioral maintenance cycle**: Anxiety \u2192 avoidance \u2192 temporary relief \u2192 increased self-criticism \u2192 worsened anxiety.  \n\n#### 3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Persistent fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of feared social situations, and clinically significant distress.  \n- **Panic Disorder with social triggers**: Panic attacks occurring in social contexts, with anticipatory anxiety.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) features**: Excessive worry about social performance, restlessness, and somatic symptoms.  \n- **Possible Somatic Symptom Disorder**: Somatic complaints (e.g., migraines, GI distress) exacerbated by anxiety, with health concerns minimized by the patient.  \n- **Avoidance as a maladaptive coping strategy**: Ritualistic behaviors (e.g., excessive self-checking before leaving home) and safety behaviors (e.g., declining opportunities).  \n- **Depressive symptomatology**: Transient low mood secondary to social withdrawal, though not meeting full criteria for a depressive disorder.  \n\n#### 4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Passive ideation**: Brief fleeting thoughts of wanting to be \"invisible,\" though no intent or plan for self-harm.  \n- **Underreporting and stigma avoidance**: Fear of being judged by providers (e.g., dismissing panic as \"stress,\" downplaying symptom severity).  \n- **Social and occupational impairment**: Career limitations due to avoidance and strained interpersonal relationships.  \n\n#### 5. **Summary in Clinical Language**  \nThe patient presents with **severe social anxiety disorder with panic features**, characterized by avoidance of social interactions, anticipatory anxiety, and panic attacks triggered by perceived social evaluation. Symptoms include somatic complaints (autonomic hyperarousal, gastrointestinal distress), cognitive distortions (self-criticism, rumination), and functional impairment in occupational and social roles. The patient exhibits **safety behaviors** (e.g., excessive self-monitoring, selective symptom minimization) and **secondary features of GAD** (persistent worry about social performance). Transient passive ideation (\"being invisible\") warrants monitoring, though no active self-harm intent is reported. The patient\u2019s fear of stigma and minimization of symptoms may impede engagement in treatment. A trauma-informed, evidence-based approach (e.g., CBT for social anxiety, interoceptive exposure) should prioritize validating the patient\u2019s experience while addressing avoidance, cognitive restructuring, and somatic symptom management. Rule out comorbid PTSD or dissociative disorders due to reported depersonalization.",
