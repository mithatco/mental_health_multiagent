      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the response exactly as specified. Let me start by summarizing the user's input. The patient is clearly struggling with social situations, showing anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance. Their symptoms are context-specific, which points to social anxiety. The panic attacks, including fainting, might tie into this disorder. I should check DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The depressive symptoms seem secondary to the anxiety rather than a separate depression. The key points from the answers are the social triggers, physical symptoms during panic, and avoidance behaviors. Need to mention syncope as a panic symptom.\n\nFor the diagnosis, I should consider Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. The fainting during social stress could be a panic-related vasovagal response. I need to ensure not to miss Somatic Symptom Disorder, but since the physical symptoms are tied to anxiety, that's secondary.\n\nThe summary should empathize with their struggles. The diagnosis section needs the exact DSM-5 code. Reasoning must link each symptom to the criteria. Next steps should include CBT, panic management, and possibly antidepressants. I'll use tags as instructed. Check formatting: headings with asterisks, no extra lines, tags properly placed. Avoid markdown beyond the required formatting. Make sure all four sections are in order. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\nYour answers highlight a profound struggle with social interactions, where everyday situations like presentations or group settings trigger intense physical reactions (e.g., <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>fainting</sym>, <sym>sweating</sym>), leading to self-imposed isolation. The distress you describe\u2014feeling \"stuck\" or \"weak\"\u2014suggests a cycle of fear of judgment and avoidance, yet your efforts to suppress these struggles (<quote>I try not to show [irritation]</quote>) hint at immense inner tension.

        "stats": {
          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. First, I need to analyze the patient's responses to the questions provided. The user wants me to act as a mental health professional reviewing these answers. The task is to identify symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and summarize observations in clinical terms.\n\nStarting with the main symptoms and concerns. Looking at the answers:\n\nQ2 mentions little interest in things when with others but okay alone. That points to social anxiety affecting their interest. Q3 talks about feeling down when thinking about social awkwardness. Q4's sleep issues before events, Q6's anxiety, and Q7's constant nervousness and physical symptoms (shaking, sweating) all point to anxiety. The panic and fainting in Q8 could be panic disorder. The patient also mentions feeling stuck and being irritable in social situations. \n\nPatterns: The patient's issues are clearly triggered by social interactions. Their symptoms worsen when they're around others. The physical symptoms like sweating and shaking during anxiety, as well as the panic attacks, are consistent with social anxiety or related disorders. They also try to hide their feelings, which might indicate avoidance behaviors. \n\nPotential clinical areas: Social anxiety disorder is a strong candidate here. The panic attacks and physical symptoms could also point towards Panic Disorder. The depressed mood linked to social situations might tie into an anxiety disorder with depressive features. The sleep disturbances are related to stress from social events. The irritability in social contexts and the avoidance of events altogether are key points.\n\nRisk factors: The fainting episode during a presentation is a physical symptom that could be a sign of severe anxiety. The avoidance of social gatherings (skipping parties) and the self-doubt about being \"overreacting\" might indicate low self-esteem or possible self-harm risk, but there's no direct mention of that. The patient's attempt to suppress anger/irritation might lead to internalized stress.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using DSM-5 criteria. I should check which disorders these symptoms align with. Social Anxiety Disorder definitely fits with fear of social situations leading to avoidance and distress. The panic attacks (Q8) could be part of Panic Disorder with or without agoraphobia, but since it's triggered by social situations, maybe specific to that. The depressive symptoms are mild, but linked to social issues, so maybe not a separate depression diagnosis unless they meet the criteria otherwise.\n\nAlso, the patient's self-doubt (\"I just hope I'm not overreacting\") might indicate some insight but also possible minimization of their condition. The physical symptoms like sweating and shaking are somatic symptoms of anxiety, so Somatic Symptom Disorder might be a consideration, but it's likely secondary to anxiety.\n\nRisk factors: The fainting episode is significant and could be a vasovagal response due to extreme anxiety, which is a concern. Avoidance behaviors leading to social withdrawal can exacerbate the condition. The patient's mention of skipping events due to panic is a functional impairment.\n\nNow, putting this into the required sections:\n\nMain Symptoms: Social-related anhedonia, depressed mood related to social anxiety, irritability in social contexts, sleep disturbance, panic attacks, physical anxiety symptoms.\n\nPatterns: Symptoms triggered by social interactions, use of avoidance (skipping events), physical reaction to stress, self-consciousness leading to distress.\n\nClinical areas: Social Anxiety Disorder (maybe with panic attacks?), possibly Panic Disorder, and depressive symptoms in context. Somatic symptoms related to anxiety.\n\nRisk factors: Fainting due to panic, avoidance leading to possible social functioning decline, possible comorbid issues.\n\nWait, in Q8, they mention fainting during a presentation. That's a significant physical reaction. Need to note that as a possible risk, maybe syncope related to anxiety. Also, the patient's self-awareness but downplaying (\"maybe that's just weak nerves\") might indicate some insight but also minimization.\n\nSo, in the summary, I need to structure each point as per the user's instructions. Make sure not to speculate beyond the given info. Avoid terms that aren't supported\u2014like if they don't mention suicidal thoughts, don't include that. \n\nDouble-check DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder: fear of social situations where one can be scrutinized, leading to avoidance or marked distress, etc. The patient's avoidance of events and the distress they feel in groups fit here. The panic attacks (Q8) could be part of Social Anxiety or Panic Disorder. Need to see if the panic attacks occur only in social contexts. The fainting during a presentation supports the idea that the panic is social-specific.\n\nAlso note the autonomic arousal (Q7: shaking, sweating) which is common in anxiety disorders. The patient's difficulty initiating conversations (Q6 mentions freezing up) is part of social anxiety. \n\nPotential areas: Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23) is primary. Panic Disorder (300.01) if panic attacks are frequent and unexpected, but here the panic is triggered by specific situations (social), so maybe better under Social Anxiety with panic attacks. Depressive symptoms are present but not pervasive, so perhaps not a major depressive disorder unless they meet full criteria. The sleep issues are related to anticipation of social events.\n\nPatterns: All symptoms cluster around social interactions, with avoidance behaviors (skipping parties, withdrawing from groups), and physiological symptoms when stressed socially.\n\nRisk factors: Fainting as a possible complication from panic, which could lead to injury. The avoidance might affect social and occupational functioning. The self-report of \"stuck\" and feeling down indicates some impact on their quality of life.\n\nI should structure this into the required sections without using markdown. Need to use clinical terms like anhedonia, autonomic arousal, avoidance behaviors, panic attacks, social dysfunction, etc.\n\nWait, the main symptoms: Anhedonia in social contexts, depressed mood in context of social stress, irritability when socially pressured, sleep disturbance (insomnia related to stress), panic attacks with physical symptoms (tachycardia, syncope), and somatic symptoms (shaking, sweating).\n\nClinical significance: Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks, possible adjustment disorder with anxious and depressive features, but the key is the social component. The panic attacks are notable, so maybe mention Panic Disorder as a differential but linked to social triggers.\n\nRisk factors: Syncope (fainting) during panic episodes, significant social avoidance affecting functioning, self-reported distress and impairment in social participation.\n\nPutting this all together concisely in clinical terms without fluff. Also, ensure that all points from the patient are addressed. For example, the sleep problem is insomnia related to social events, not generalized.\n\nOkay, time to format the answer as per the structure requested, using bullet points in clinical language. Avoid guessing; stick to what's in the responses.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**:  \n   - Socially triggered anhedonia (diminished interest/pleasure in group settings).  \n   - Recurrent panic attacks (e.g., syncope during presentations, racing heart, sweating, shaking).  \n   - Significant social anxiety: avoidance of social events, anticipatory anxiety (e.g., insomnia before events, skipping gatherings.  \n   - Autonomic hyperarousal (e.g., nervousness, on-edge sensations.  \n   - Contextual dysphoria (feeling \"stuck\" or hopeless when reflecting on social limitations.  \n   - Irritability in pressured social interactions (masked by suppression.  \n\n2. **Patterns in Responses**:  \n   - Symptoms are consistently **triggered by social/performance situations** (e.g., presentations, group interactions.  \n   - Evidence of **avoidance behaviors** (skipping parties, withdrawing from groups.  \n   - Self-referential focus on perceived social \"awkwardness\" and its impact on mood.  \n   - Minimization of symptom severity (\"not that bad,\" \"weak nerves\").  \n\n3. **Potential Clinical Significance**:  \n   - **Social Anxiety Disorder**: Core presentation with marked avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and functional impairment.  \n   - **Panic Disorder with social-specific triggers**: Panic attacks (including syncope) linked to performance/social stressors.  \n   - **Anxiety- or stressor-related dysphoria**: Depressed mood tied to social functioning, but not pervasive.  \n   - **Somatic symptoms**: Autonomic arousal (tremor, sweating) in anxiety contexts.  \n\n4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**:  \n   - Episodic syncope during panic attacks (potential for injury or adverse outcomes.  \n   - Progressive social withdrawal and avoidance impacting interpersonal/occupational functioning.  \n   - Physical manifestations of anxiety (e.g., sleep disturbance, somatic symptoms.  \n\n5. **Summary (Clinical Language)**:  \n   - The patient presents with **marked social anxiety disorder**, characterized by anticipatory and situational panic attacks (including syncope), avoidance behaviors, and somatic symptoms (tremor, diaphoresis). Symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23), with panic attacks triggered by social/performance demands. Notable functional impairment includes avoidance of social engagements and sleep disturbance. Contextual dysphoria and irritability further underscore the impact on quality of life. Risk factors include physical decompensation (syncope) and progressive restriction of activities. No overt suicidal ideation or self-harm reported. Further evaluation is warranted to assess for comorbid adjustment disorder or panic disorder with social-specific triggers.",

For instance, after the patient mentioned fainting during a presentation, the therapist could have explored this symptom further but instead moved on to other areas.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks is generally supported by the patient's symptoms, and the therapist provided some reasoning for this diagnosis. The therapist explicitly linked the patient's symptoms to DSM-5 criteria, such as persistent fear of negative evaluation in social contexts and avoidance of feared situations. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses were not extensively discussed or ruled out. For example, the therapist could have considered other anxiety disorders or mood disorders that might also explain the patient's symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses mostly convey empathy and a professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences, such as recognizing the patient's feelings of being 'stuck' and 'weak.' However, there were moments where the therapist's responses seemed slightly robotic or impersonal, and opportunities for deeper empathy or emotional connection were occasionally missed. For instance, when the patient expressed feeling 'stuck,' the therapist could have explored this feeling further to provide more personalized support."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a good effort to assess the patient's symptoms and experiences using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. However, several areas were superficially addressed or omitted, and the therapist could have probed deeper into concerning symptoms. The diagnosis appears to align with the patient's symptoms, but justification could have been more comprehensive. Overall, the conversation shows promise but could benefit from more thorough exploration of DSM-5 domains, improved logical flow, and enhanced empathy.",

      "predicted": "Your answers highlight a profound struggle with social interactions, where everyday situations like presentations or group settings trigger intense physical reactions (e.g., <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>fainting</sym>, <sym>sweating</sym>), leading to self-imposed isolation. The distress you describe\u2014feeling \"stuck\" or \"weak\"\u2014suggests a cycle of fear of judgment and avoidance, yet your efforts to suppress these struggles (<quote>I try not to show [irritation]</quote>) hint at immense inner tension. Your symptoms appear deeply tied to social performance and interpersonal settings, creating a web of physical, emotional, and social challenges.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23) with panic attacks, unspecified, recurrent  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder**: Symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria, including persistent fear of negative evaluation in social/performance contexts, avoidance of feared situations (skipping parties, withdrawing from groups), and significant distress. The phrase \"<quote>feeling down... when I think about how socially awkward I am</quote>\" reflects self-punitive rumination central to this disorder.  \n- **Panic Attacks**: Recurrent panic episodes (e.g., syncope during presentations, racing heart, physical collapse) are acutely triggered by social/performance stressors, meeting DSM-5 panic attack criteria.  \n- **Exclusion of other disorders**: Symptoms are not better explained by <med>pure somatic symptom disorder</med> (symptoms are tied to social context) or generalized anxiety/mood disorders (symptoms are socially specific).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting social anxiety, including exposure-based exercises to reduce avoidance and cognitive restructuring of self-critical beliefs.  \n2. **Panic management training**: Breathing techniques, grounding strategies, and gradual exposure to high-anxiety social scenarios.  \n3. **Assessment for SSRIs**: Consider <med>sertraline</med> or <med>paroxetine</med> (first-line pharmacotherapy for social anxiety with panic features.  \n4. **Collaborative functional analysis**: Identify specific triggers (e.g., presentations, group settings) to tailor interventions.  \n5. **Safety planning**: Address fainting/syncope risks via hydration, grounding techniques, and medical consultation if recurrent.  \n6. **Normalize distress**: Validate that social anxiety is treatable and their symptoms are not a sign of \"weakness\" but a treatable condition.",
