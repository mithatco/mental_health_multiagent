      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to structure the response exactly as the user specified. Let me start with the compassionate summary. The user mentioned the patient's panic attacks and avoidance, so I should acknowledge their struggle empathetically.\n\nNext, the diagnosis section. The patient has frequent panic attacks with avoidance, which points to Panic Disorder. The avoidance of specific places like buses and elevators suggests Agoraphobia, so combining those makes sense. I'll use the DSM-5 criteria here.\n\nFor the reasoning, I have to link the symptoms to the diagnosis. The panic attacks meet the frequency requirement, and the avoidance of situations due to fear of panic aligns with Agoraphobia. Also, the anxiety is causing significant impairment in daily life.\n\nTreatment steps should include CBT, which is first-line for anxiety disorders, meds like SSRIs or benzodiazepines, and possibly a referral to a specialist. I need to make sure each step is clear and actionable.\n\nI have to remember to use the tags properly. Medical terms like Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia go in med tags, symptoms like panic attacks and avoidance in sym, and quotes from the patient's answers in quote tags.\n\nWait, the user's response includes a quote about avoiding the elevator leading to hyperventilation. I should include that as a quote. Also, the insomnia and hypervigilance are part of the anxiety, so those need to be noted in the reasoning.\n\nCheck the structure: four sections with exact headings, tags applied correctly, no extra formatting. Make sure the diagnosis is the first line after the heading. The user emphasized not using any introductory phrases, so start right with the summary.\n\nEverything seems covered. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Avoiding situations where you might feel anxious</sym> and persistent <sym>panic attacks</sym> describe a cycle of fear and disconnection from the world.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the patient's answers to the first nine questions of the DSM-5 screening. I need to analyze these responses and structure the answer according to the five points specified.\n\nFirst, the main symptoms and concerns. The patient mentions anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance. They avoid situations like hiking, buses, crowded places, and even work. The panic attacks are frequent (a few times a week) with physical symptoms like chest tightness and hyperventilation. They also mention trouble sleeping and irritability when others don't understand their cancellations.\n\nNext, patterns. The patient's avoidance is a key pattern. They avoid activities they used to enjoy and situations that trigger anxiety. The panic attacks are frequent and debilitating. The anxiety seems to be the primary driver, with depressive symptoms only after panic episodes, not primary.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Panic Disorder comes to mind because of the panic attacks and avoidance (maybe Agoraphobia as well, since they avoid certain places). Generalized Anxiety Disorder is possible because of the constant nervousness. There's also some sleep disturbance and irritability, which are common in anxiety disorders.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs. The avoidance is affecting their job and daily life, which is a functional impairment. The hyperventilation and fear of dying during panic attacks might indicate severity. The mention of lying awake worrying points to insomnia related to anxiety.\n\nNow, summarizing in clinical terms. Need to use DSM-5 criteria where possible. Mention the frequency and intensity of panic attacks, the avoidance behavior, the impact on daily functioning, and the associated symptoms like sleep disturbance and irritability. Avoid speculation, stick to what's reported.\n\nWait, should I consider any other disorders? The patient didn't mention mania or euphoria, so no bipolar. The lack of energy and trouble sleeping align more with anxiety than depression, though some depressive symptoms are present but secondary. The main focus is on anxiety and panic.\n\nCheck if all points are covered. Main symptoms: panic attacks, avoidance, anxiety, sleep issues, irritability. Patterns: avoidance linked to anxiety, secondary depressive feelings. Clinical areas: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia possibly. Risk factors: functional impairment, possible worsening if not addressed. Yeah, that fits.\n\nMake sure the summary is concise and uses terms like \"clinically significant,\" \"functional impairment,\" and references DSM-5 criteria where applicable. Avoid making a diagnosis but highlight the key points for a clinician to consider.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Panic Symptoms:** Recurrent panic attacks (2\u20133x/week) with somatic symptoms (chest tightness, hyperventilation, fear of dying).  \n- **Anxiety/avoidance:** Marked avoidance of situations perceived as anxiety-provoking (e.g., public transport, crowded spaces, work, hiking). Hyperarousal (e.g., constant nervousness, feeling \"on edge\").  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance interferes with occupational and recreational activities (e.g.,\u53d6\u6d88 plans, work absences).  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia due to worry, leading to fatigue.  \n- **Emotional Reactivity:** Irritability when others misunderstand their anxiety-driven cancellations.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Primary Driver:** Anxiety and fear of panic attacks underpin avoidance behaviors and functional limitations.  \n- **Secondary Symptoms:** Depressive feelings (Q3) are reported only *after* panic episodes, not as standalone depression.  \n- **Consistency:** Responses align with hypervigilance to triggers (e.g., elevators, crowded spaces) and fear of loss of control.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Areas of Significance:**  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia:** Frequent panic attacks + avoidance of feared situations to prevent panic.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Constant nervousness and hypervigilance.  \n- **Social/Performance Anxiety:** Embarrassment/shame around canceling plans, leading to interpersonal tension.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance of occupational and social roles indicates significant life disruption.  \n- **Physical Sensitivity:** Baseline somatic symptoms (e.g., racing heart, hyperventilation) may exacerbate anxiety.  \n- **Potential Safety Concerns:** While no direct suicidal/harmful ideation is stated, severe anxiety could contribute to maladaptive coping.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with clinically significant symptoms of recurrent, distressing panic attacks (DSM-5 criterion A for Panic Disorder) and avoidance behaviors (criterion B for Agoraphobia). Hypervigilance, autonomic arousal (e.g., tachycardia), and insomnia further support an anxiety-related diagnosis. Secondary irritability and situational depressive feelings (post-panic episodes) suggest comorbid emotional dysregulation. Functional impairment is notable in occupational and social domains due to avoidance. No acute safety risks are reported, but the chronicity and interference of symptoms warrant further assessment for Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, GAD, and evaluation of safety in high-stress situations.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Avoiding situations where you might feel anxious</sym> and persistent <sym>panic attacks</sym> describe a cycle of fear and disconnection from the world. Your <sym>avoidance of once-enjoyable activities</sym> like hiking and work underscores how this struggle is isolating. The <sym>constant nervousness</sym> and hyperarousal\u2014like racing thoughts or hypervigilance\u2014suggest your body is in a near-constant \"fight-or-flight\" state.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>, with <med>comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>Panic Disorder</med> is supported by <sym>recurrent unexpected panic attacks</sym> (e.g., \"I think I'm dying\" during episodes), coupled with <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> and avoidance behaviors. The <sym>avoidance of elevators, crowded spaces, and work</sym> aligns with <med>Agoraphobia</med> (DSM-5 criterion B).1).1 for Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia).  \n- <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is indicated by <sym>excessive, chronic anxiety about daily stressors</sym> (e.g., lying awake worrying, irritability when plans change).  \n- <sym>Physical symptoms (e.g., hyperventilation, chest tightness)</sym> and sleep disturbance (<sym>insomnia due to worry</sym>) are hallmark features of these conditions.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Focus on exposure-based interventions to address agoraphobic avoidance and panic triggers (e.g., gradual exposure to feared spaces).  \n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider low-dose <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>SNRIs</med> to reduce panic symptoms and anxiety. Short-term <med>benzodiazepines</med> (e.g., clonazepam) could address acute panic episodes.  \n3. **Daily Grounding Techniques:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness to manage <sym>hypervigilance</sym> and panic escalation.  \n4. **Functional Restoration Plan:** Gradually reintegrate avoided activities (e.g., brief, supported hikes or public transport use) to rebuild tolerance.  \n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address insomnia through scheduled relaxation before bed and limiting pre-sleep screen time.  \n\nThis plan prioritizes safety, symptom management, and restoring daily functioning while addressing both panic-specific and generalized anxiety patterns.",
