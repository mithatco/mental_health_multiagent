      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. The user provided their responses and wants a structured assessment. The key is to follow the exact structure they specified, so I need to make sure everything is in order.\n\nFirst, the compassionate summary. I need to paraphrase their experience, showing empathy. Highlight their struggles with social interactions, the anxiety, and how it's impacting their life. Use the tags for quotes and symptoms where appropriate.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. From the answers, the main issues are social anxiety, avoidance, panic attacks, and cognitive symptoms. The DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (300.22) fit well here. They have persistent fear of negative evaluation, avoidance, and physical symptoms. There's also a panic attack, but that might be part of the social anxiety context. I should check if it's primary SAD or if panic disorder is separate. But since the panic attack occurred in a social context, it's likely part of SAD. \n\nThe Reasoning section needs to outline why the diagnosis fits. Mention the DSM-5 criteria: avoidance, physiological symptoms, distress, functional impairment. Also note any comorbidities like GAD or possible OCD features, but clarify that the primary issue is social anxiety.\n\nNext Steps should include therapy options like CBT, SSRIs if needed, exposure therapy, tracking symptoms, and addressing sleep issues. Also, rule out other disorders. Make sure to use numbered points and proper tags for medical terms.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the panic attack. Under SAD, panic attacks can be a specifier. The key is that the anxiety is specifically around social situations. Also, they don't mention trauma, so PTSD is out. The repetitive thoughts (Q16, Q17) are more about social performance, not OCD compulsions. \n\nI need to ensure all tags are correctly placed. Symptoms like \"avoidant behaviors\" go in <sym>, medical terms like Social Anxiety Disorder in <med>, and their quotes in <quote>. \n\nCheck the structure again: four sections with exact headings. No markdown, just the asterisks. Make sure the diagnosis is first under the Diagnosis section. \n\nOkay, putting it all together step by step, ensuring all requirements are met. Let me draft each part carefully, then review for any missing tags or formatting issues. Ensure the reasoning clearly links symptoms to DSM-5 criteria. The next steps list practical recommendations. \n\nMake sure not to mention any disorders not supported by the answers. The user's responses don't indicate psychosis (they denied voices), so that's ruled out. The alcohol use is minimal, so not a substance use disorder. \n\nYes, the main diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. The recommendations should include CBT, maybe medication, gradual exposure, sleep hygiene, tracking, and avoiding substance use. \n\nAlright, that should cover it. Now format it precisely as instructed, with all tags and sections correct.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest in social activities, avoidance of feared situations,  \nphysical symptoms like blushing/shaking, panic attacks, and social isolation</sym> suggest profound distress tied to <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through the patient's responses carefully. The user wants me to act as a clinical mental health professional reviewing these answers. The task is to identify main symptoms, patterns, areas of clinical significance, risk factors, and summarize it all in clinical terms.\n\nFirst, looking at the answers: the patient mentions little interest in social activities, which is Q2. They avoid social events due to nervousness, but are okay when alone. That's a hint of social anxiety. Then, feeling stuck but not hopeless (Q3) might indicate some depressive symptoms, but not severe. \n\nThe patient's answer to Q4 says they have trouble sleeping and aren't energetic, so maybe insomnia related to anxiety. Q7 and Q8 talk about anxiety, nervousness, and avoidance of anxiety-inducing situations. The panic attack at work (Q8) is a key point. The physical symptoms like blushing and shaking in Q10 are common in social anxiety.\n\nLooking at Q16 and Q17, the patient mentions intrusive thoughts about social judgment and repetitive rehearsal of conversations. That's a sign of obsessive-compulsive traits or rumination, which is common in anxiety disorders. The body scanning questions like Q12 and Q13 about hearing voices or thoughts being read are denied, so psychosis is unlikely. \n\nSleep problems in Q15 and Q14 again point to anxiety-related insomnia. The patient's use of alcohol is minimal (Q21) but they do have some use before events, which could be a coping mechanism. No substance abuse, though. \n\nThe feeling of detachment in Q18, like depersonalization, could be part of anxiety. Their guardedness in relationships (Q20, Q21) suggests social anxiety affecting their ability to form deeper connections. \n\nPutting this together, the main diagnosis here is likely Social Anxiety Disorder. The symptoms align: fear of social situations, avoidance, physical symptoms when anxious, panic attacks, and the impact on their life. The repetitive thoughts and behaviors (Q16, Q17) might also touch on OCD features, but it's more about anxiety. \n\nNo suicidal thoughts (Q11), no psychosis, which rules out other disorders. The risk factors are the panic attack and social isolation, which can lead to worsening anxiety if untreated. The patterns show avoidance and physiological arousal in social contexts. They also use minimal alcohol as a coping strategy, which is a concern but not a disorder here. \n\nI need to make sure I don't miss anything. The main areas would be social anxiety with possible comorbid generalized anxiety or OCD traits. The summary needs to be concise, using terms like \"clinically significant social anxiety symptoms,\" \"avoidant behaviors,\" \"physiological arousal,\" and mention the panic attack as a notable incident. Also, note the impact on daily functioning and relationships. The alcohol use is a coping mechanism but not excessive. The depersonalization during social interactions is another symptom to include. \n\nWait, the patient mentions rehearsing conversations and overthinking interactions. That's part of the anxiety, maybe cognitive behavioral patterns. The key points are the avoidance, physical symptoms, panic attack, and the impact on their social life. They haven't mentioned any trauma or PTSD, so that's probably not relevant here. \n\nI should structure the summary into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risk factors, and the clinical summary. Make sure to use DSM-5 terminology where possible, like \"clinically significant distress,\" \"recurrent panic attacks,\" etc. Avoid speculation, just stick to what's reported. \n\nOkay, time to organize all these thoughts into the required structure without missing any critical points.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n---\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social Anxiety/Performance Anxiety**: Marked avoidance of social interactions, anticipatory anxiety (e.g., avoiding parties, rehearsing conversations, physical symptoms like blushing, trembling, and panic attacks).  \n- **Anxiety-Related Physiological Symptoms**: Palpitations, shakiness, and gastrointestinal distress in social situations (Q7, Q10).  \n- **Panic Attack History**: One documented panic attack in a work setting (Q8).  \n- **Insomnia and Rumination**: Difficulty falling asleep due to social anxiety-related worries; intrusive thoughts about perceived social failures (Q14, Q16, Q17).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Avoidance Behaviors**: Consistent avoidance of feared social situations (e.g., skipping team lunches, declining invitations) to manage anxiety.  \n- **Cognitive Rumination**: Persistent self-critical thoughts (\"What if I say something stupid?\") and compulsive rehearsal of interactions (Q17, Q18).  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Difficulty forming close relationships and maintaining professional social engagement (Q21).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Core symptoms (fear of negative evaluation, avoidance, physiological reactivity) are prominent.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Excessive worry about social performance, restlessness, and sleep disturbances (Q3, Q7, Q14, Q16).  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobic Features**: Panic attack in a social context and avoidance of triggering environments (Q8, Q9).  \n- **Possible Subthreshold Obsessive-Compulsive Traits**: Repeatedly reviewing social interactions and ritualistic preparation (Q17, Q18).  \n\n---\n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Social Isolation**: Compromised interpersonal relationships and work-related social participation.  \n- **Emergent Panic Episodes**: History of a panic attack suggests heightened physiological reactivity.  \n- **Maladaptive Coping**: Alcohol use (one glass of wine pre-event) as a strategy to manage anxiety.  \n- **Depersonalization**: Brief episodes during acute anxiety (Q18), indicating emotional dysregulation.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Clinical Summary**  \nThe patient presents with **clinically significant social anxiety symptoms** meeting DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23), with features of generalized anxiety and potential panic disorder. Key symptoms include:  \n- **Avoidant behaviors** in social/performance situations (Q2, Q8, Q9),  \n- **Physiological hyperarousal** (trembling, heart palpitations, gastrointestinal distress) during anxiety provocation (Q7, Q10),  \n- **Cognitive distortions** (e.g., fear of negative evaluation, intrusive self-critical thoughts) (Q3, Q16, Q17).  \n- **Secondary sleep disturbance** and social withdrawal (Q14, Q21).  \n\n**Additional Considerations**:  \n- Subthreshold OCD features (obsessive rumination without compulsions).  \n- Brief depersonalization during acute stress (Q18.  \n- Limited use of alcohol as an anxiolytic (Q21), requiring monitoring.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n- Formal diagnostic evaluation for SAD and comorbid GAD/Panic Disorder.  \n- Cognitive-behavioral interventions targeting social anxiety (e.g., exposure therapy), cognitive restructuring for social phobia, and stress management.  \n- Sleep hygiene assessment and monitoring of coping strategies.  \n\n--- \n\nThis summary adheres to DSM-5 criteria and focuses on observable, reported symptoms without assumptions beyond the data provided.",
