I'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to better understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. This will help us identify areas to discuss and track your symptoms over time. Your answers will remain confidential, and there are no right or wrong responses. We'll go through 23 questions one at a time. Ready? Let's start with the first question: How much have you been bothered by LITTLE INTEREST OR PLEASURE IN DOING THINGS during the past two weeks?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a series of patient responses to a DSM-5 questionnaire. My job is to analyze these responses and structure the summary as per the instructions. First, I need to identify the main symptoms. The patient talks about little interest in activities, feeling down, irritability, anxiety, panic attacks, physical aches, sleep issues, and problems with memory. \n\nNext, I should note the patterns. The patient's symptoms seem to be chronic over the past two weeks. The frequency of panic attacks (5 times in a week) and daily anxiety are significant. The avoidance behaviors, like skipping public transport and social plans, point to possible social withdrawal and functional impairment. The mention of physical symptoms not being taken seriously by others might indicate secondary distress from invalidation.\n\nFor clinical significance, panic disorder comes to mind with the panic attacks and avoidance. The anhedonia and low mood could overlap with depression, but the primary driver might be anxiety. Sleep disturbances and irritability are common in both. The somatic symptoms (aches, chest tightness) without medical cause are often seen in anxiety disorders. The patient's feelings of being dismissed (Q10) might contribute to worsened symptoms.\n\nRisk factors: The patient reports no suicidal thoughts (Q11 is 0 or 1, and they deny intent), but the high anxiety and avoidance could lead to social isolation. The hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts (Q16) about panic symptoms might escalate the cycle of anxiety.\n\nNow, in clinical terms, I need to structure the summary. The main symptoms would be panic disorder with agoraphobia due to situational avoidance. The depressive symptoms are present but secondary. The sleep issues and cognitive problems (memory) are secondary to anxiety. The patient's perception of invalidation (Q10) is important for treatment planning, as feeling misunderstood can hinder recovery. \n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance, comorbid anxiety-related depressive symptoms, insomnia, and somatic symptoms. The patterns show high symptom severity and functional impairment. Risk factors are the social withdrawal and possible exacerbation from feeling dismissed. \n\nI need to make sure not to mention anything speculative. Stick strictly to what the patient reported. The summary should be concise, using terms like \"clinically significant symptoms of panic disorder,\" mention the cross-cutting symptoms like anhedonia and insomnia, and note the absence of psychotic symptoms (since Q12 and Q13 are negative). Highlight the functional impact from avoidance and social withdrawal. Also, the frequent panic attacks and the physical symptoms that the patient describes as unexplained but validated through the questionnaire.\n\nAlright, putting this all together in the structured way the user asked. Use DSM-5 criteria where applicable. Make sure to list each section as 1 to 5 as specified. Avoid any markdown and keep it in a clinical tone but concise.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n   - **Recurrent panic attacks** (5+ episodes/week) with associated **physical symptoms** (tachycardia, dyspnea, chest tightness).  \n   - **Anxiety-related anhedonia** (Q1) and **functional impairment** due to avoidance of social/public situations (Q8).  \n   - **Persistent anxiety symptoms**: hypervigilance, feeling \"on edge\" (Q6), intrusive thoughts (Q16), and sleep disturbances (Q14).  \n   - **Secondary depressive symptoms** (Q2): transient low mood post-panic episodes, but not primary depressive features.  \n\n2. **Patterns in Responses**  \n   - **Daily anxiety/panic symptoms** (Q6, Q7, Q16) with **situational triggers** (e.g., crowded places, new environments).  \n   - **Cognitive impairment**: memory lapses (Q15) and hypervigilance correlate with anxiety severity.  \n   - **Avoidance behaviors** (Q8) escalating due to fear of panic attacks in public.  \n   - **Secondary distress** from perceived medical/minimalization of symptoms (Q10).  \n\n3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n   - **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia** (repeated panic attacks + avoidance of feared environments).  \n   - **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: persistent anxiety, restlessness, and somatic symptoms (Q9, Q6.  \n   - **Sleep disturbance** (insomnia with nightmares, Q14) exacerbating symptom severity.  \n   - **Health Anxiety**: somatic symptoms (Q9) and preoccupation with perceived undiagnosed illness (Q10.  \n\n4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n   - **Functional impairment**: social withdrawal (Q8), occupational impairment (panic attacks at work).  \n   - **Secondary emotional distress** from invalidation (Q10) potentially worsening symptoms.  \n   - **Cognitive dysfunction** (Q15) may impact daily functioning.  \n   - **No acute suicidal ideation** (Q11), but persistent anxiety could increase risk over time if untreated.  \n\n5. **Summary (Clinical Language)**  \n   The patient presents with **clinically significant symptoms of panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance**, as evidenced by recurrent panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and situational avoidance (Q7, Q8). **GAD features** (Q6, Q16) and **insomnia** (Q14) contribute to persistent distress. Secondary **anhedonia** (Q1) and **health anxiety** (Q9, Q10) suggest somatization related to anxiety. Cognitive impairments (Q15) and social withdrawal highlight functional impairment. No psychotic features (Q12, Q13). Symptom severity aligns with DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia and comorbid GAD. Prioritization of treatment should address panic management, cognitive-behavioral interventions for avoidance, and sleep hygiene. Addressing perceived medical invalidation (Q10) is critical to enhance engagement and therapeutic alliance.",
