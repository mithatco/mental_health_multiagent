      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to go through the user's responses again to ensure I didn't miss anything. The user clearly avoids social situations due to fear of judgment, has panic attacks, and physical symptoms like shaking hands and blushing. Their main issue is social anxiety affecting their life. But I should check if there's another disorder.\n\nThey mentioned panic attacks, so maybe Panic Disorder? But the panic occurs in social contexts, so it might be part of SAD. The DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of embarrassment and avoidance, which fits here. They don't have other panic triggers outside social settings, so SAD is primary.  \n\nSomatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) was mentioned in the references. The user's physical symptoms (like shaking hands) are tied to social anxiety, so SSD isn't primary unless they're excessively concerned about the symptoms. The user says doctors called it stress, so maybe they feel symptoms are dismissed. However, the physical symptoms are better explained by social anxiety.  \n\nPTSD isn't supported here. There's no trauma history mentioned, just social anxiety. No mania or bipolar traits\u2014Q6 says they don't start projects, so Bipolar is out.  \n\nMood disorders: They report feeling \"off\" and frustration, but the primary issue is anxiety, not depression.  \n\nThe user's symptoms align most with Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. The avoidance and distress are causing significant impairment in work and social life. Treatment recommendations should focus on CBT and maybe SSRIs.  \n\nI need to structure it exactly as instructed. First paragraph must be compassionate, then Diagnosis with SAD, Reasoning explaining why, and treatment steps. Make sure to use the tags correctly. Check for any other possible conditions, but nothing else fits better. SSD is a consideration but not primary here. Alright, time to format the answer properly.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms of intense social anxiety</sym> are central to your experience. Your <sym>fear of being watched</sym> and <sym>avoidance of work/social opportunities</sym> must be deeply frustrating, especially when you still find joy in solitary activities like reading. The <sym>physical sensations</sym>\u2014shaking hands, blushing, racing heart\u2014are clearly tied to social interactions, and the feeling that <quote>\"it's not in my head\"</quote> reflects a struggle to reconcile mind-body distress. The loneliness of carrying this alone, paired with feeling misunderstood by doctors, must be overwhelming. You deserve support to reconnect with your life without letting anxiety shrink your world.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23) with associated panic attacks and significant somatic symptoms  \n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation fits <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (DSM-5 criteria A-F):  \n1. **Core symptoms**: Marked fear of scrutiny in social/performance situations (Q2, Q8-9, Q16-17).  \n2. **Avoidance/impairment**: Avoiding career opportunities, work events, and socializing (Q2, Q8-9), limiting life functioning.  \n3. **Panic attacks**: Acute episodes of <sym>heart pounding</sym> in social contexts (Q7-8).  \n4. **Somatic symptoms**: Physical distress (tremors, blushing) tied specifically to social interactions (Q7, Q10-11.  \n5. **Negative impact of medical encounters**: Perception that physical symptoms are dismissed (Q10-11.  \n6. **Rule-outs**: No evidence of psychosis (Q12-13), depression (Q2-3), or trauma-related disorders.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety via exposure therapy, cognitive restructuring for self-criticism, and management of somatic symptoms.  \n2. **SSRIs or SNRIs:** Consider <med>sertraline</med> or <med>venlafaxine XR</med> to reduce anxiety and physiological hyperarousal.  \n3. **Psychological education:** Normalize somatic symptoms as part of anxiety while ruling out medical causes (e.g., thyroid panel if untested).  \n4. **Occupational adjustments:** Short-term workplace accommodations (e.g., gradual exposure to social tasks) to prevent career setbacks.  \n5. **Collaborative care:** Involve primary care to address concerns about dismissed symptoms and coordinate referrals for specialized CBT.  \n\nThe focus is on validating your experience, reducing avoidance cycles, and restoring confidence in social contexts.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire. Let me start by going through each question and their answers one by one to understand the main symptoms and concerns.\n\nFirst, Q1 shows the patient is somewhat nervous but willing to proceed. The main issue here seems to be anxiety. Looking at Q2, they still enjoy solitary activities but avoid group ones due to dread of being watched. That points towards social anxiety. Q3 mentions feeling off, but it's more frustration about anxiety rather than true depression. The patient's sadness is secondary to their anxiety.\n\nIn Q4, they have trouble sleeping, which is common in anxiety disorders. They can't sleep due to worrying, leading to fatigue. Q5 says they don't start projects, which is the opposite of mania, so probably not bipolar. Q6 is a strong indicator of anxiety, especially social\u2014panic attacks (Q7) and avoidance behaviors (Q8, Q9) are key here. The physical symptoms in Q10 like shaking hands and blushing are somatic symptoms linked to social situations. \n\nThe patient feels dismissed by doctors (Q11), which could affect treatment adherence. They don't have suicidal thoughts (Q12), which is good, but they do feel trapped (Q13). They mention paranoia about being judged (Q14, Q16, Q17), which is a common anxiety thought pattern. Memory issues in social situations (Q15) might be due to anxiety distraction or rumination. \n\nPatterns here are clear: social avoidance, physical anxiety symptoms, excessive self-criticism, sleep disturbance, and feeling misunderstood. The clinical significance points to Social Anxiety Disorder, possibly with specific phobia (social type). The avoidance is severe, affecting work (like job opportunities and presentations), which is significant. \n\nRisk factors include the impact on their career and social life, but no self-harm. The patient's functional impairment is notable. Need to check for possible agoraphobia, but it's more social. Also, the exclusion of psychosis (Q12, Q13) is important. The persistent nature of symptoms over two weeks meets duration criteria. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary diagnosis seems Social Anxiety Disorder with significant impairment. The patient's physical symptoms might warrant looking into Panic Disorder, but the context suggests they're tied to social interactions. They need validation of their symptoms to build trust. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with possible SSRIs could help. \n\nI should structure the summary into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risks, and the clinical summary. Make sure to use proper terminology without speculating beyond the given info. Avoid mentioning things not directly stated, like other disorders unless supported. Highlight the functional impact and specific symptoms like avoidance and somatic issues. Ensure the summary is concise and professional.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety/avoidance**: Significant avoidance of group activities (e.g., volunteering, presentations, social gatherings) driven by fear of judgment/perceived scrutiny.  \n- **Physical symptoms in social contexts**: Tremors, blushing, voice tremors, and gastrointestinal distress (stomach knots).  \n- **Anxiety-related cognitive distortions**: Persistent self-critical thoughts, fear of embarrassment, and rumination on social interactions.  \n- **Sleep disturbance**: Difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep due to anxiety about social situations.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance impacting career opportunities (e.g., declining job offers, avoiding work-related socializing).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Exacerbation of symptoms in social/performance contexts**, with sparing of solitary activities.  \n- **Self-reported under-recognition of severity**: Minimization of symptoms as \u201cshyness\u201d contrasts with objective impairment.  \n- **Secondary frustration and hopelessness**: Emphasis on feeling trapped by anxiety, though no suicidal ideation.  \n- **Intrusive rumination**: Replaying conversations and fixating on perceived social failures.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)** with **significant interpersonal and occupational impairment**.  \n- **Panic Disorder**: History of panic attack (acute episode of pounding heart/presence in Q8).  \n- **Somatic symptom amplification**: Physical symptoms linked to social anxiety, not explained by medical conditions.  \n- **Avoidant behaviors**: Restriction of activities and relationships to mitigate anxiety.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Occupational distress**: Procrastination, missed opportunities, and work-related avoidance.  \n- **Social withdrawal**: Increasing isolation and reliance on solitary coping.  \n- **Perceived invalidation by healthcare providers** (Q10), risking treatment nonadherence.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **severe social anxiety disorder** characterized by marked avoidance of social/performance situations, somatic symptoms (e.g., tremors, gastrointestinal distress), and cognitive distortions (e.g., fear of negative evaluation, rumination). Symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for SAD, including panic attacks (Q7, Q8) and persistent functional impairment in occupational and social domains. Sleep disturbance and hypervigilance about perceived judgment further corroborate anxiety pathology. No evidence of psychotic features (Q12-Q13). The patient\u2019s history of dismissing symptoms as \u201cstress\u201d underscores the need for validation and structured treatment. Risk of worsening avoidance and occupational decline is present, but no acute self-harm or suicidal ideation. Consider differential diagnosis (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder) but prioritize SAD given context. Clinician should assess for comorbid conditions (e.g., panic disorder, avoidant personality disorder) and explore CBT, SSRIs, or SNRIs as first-line interventions.",

      "explanations": {
        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains. Questions covered depression, anxiety, anger, energy/activity, sleep quality, cognitive function, and repetitive thoughts/behaviors. However, some domains like mania (only 2 questions), psychotic symptoms, and substance use were not thoroughly explored or directly addressed. The therapist could have probed deeper in certain areas, such as suicidal ideation, which was mentioned but not expanded upon.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. However, there were moments where the phrasing could have been more precise or comprehensive. For example, when discussing 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the focus was mainly on social activities rather than overall interest or pleasure. Additionally, some questions seemed to conflate related but distinct concepts, such as anxiety and somatic symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flows logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the transition could have been smoother. For example, after the patient discussed suicidal thoughts, the therapist quickly moved to other topics without thorough follow-up. Overall, the conversation maintained coherence, but minor logical inconsistencies occasionally arose.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder with associated panic attacks and significant somatic symptoms is clearly justified by the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific DSM-5 criteria and patient symptoms, demonstrating a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration. The reasoning provided was sound and aligned with the conversation content.",
        "empathy": "The therapist consistently demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style. Responses were personalized, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experience. The therapist's tone was professional, and they effectively tailored their responses to the patient's emotional state, creating a supportive environment for discussion."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong clinical approach, effectively identifying and diagnosing social anxiety disorder with associated symptoms. While some DSM-5 domains were not thoroughly explored, the therapist showed empathy and a clear understanding of the patient's experience. Minor issues in clinical relevance and consistency were noted, but overall, the assessment was comprehensive and well-structured.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Symptoms of intense social anxiety</sym> are central to your experience. Your <sym>fear of being watched</sym> and <sym>avoidance of work/social opportunities</sym> must be deeply frustrating, especially when you still find joy in solitary activities like reading. The <sym>physical sensations</sym>\u2014shaking hands, blushing, racing heart\u2014are clearly tied to social interactions, and the feeling that <quote>\"it's not in my head\"</quote> reflects a struggle to reconcile mind-body distress. The loneliness of carrying this alone, paired with feeling misunderstood by doctors, must be overwhelming. You deserve support to reconnect with your life without letting anxiety shrink your world.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23) with associated panic attacks and significant somatic symptoms  \n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation fits <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (DSM-5 criteria A-F):  \n1. **Core symptoms**: Marked fear of scrutiny in social/performance situations (Q2, Q8-9, Q16-17).  \n2. **Avoidance/impairment**: Avoiding career opportunities, work events, and socializing (Q2, Q8-9), limiting life functioning.  \n3. **Panic attacks**: Acute episodes of <sym>heart pounding</sym> in social contexts (Q7-8).  \n4. **Somatic symptoms**: Physical distress (tremors, blushing) tied specifically to social interactions (Q7, Q10-11.  \n5. **Negative impact of medical encounters**: Perception that physical symptoms are dismissed (Q10-11.  \n6. **Rule-outs**: No evidence of psychosis (Q12-13), depression (Q2-3), or trauma-related disorders.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety via exposure therapy, cognitive restructuring for self-criticism, and management of somatic symptoms.  \n2. **SSRIs or SNRIs:** Consider <med>sertraline</med> or <med>venlafaxine XR</med> to reduce anxiety and physiological hyperarousal.  \n3. **Psychological education:** Normalize somatic symptoms as part of anxiety while ruling out medical causes (e.g., thyroid panel if untested).  \n4. **Occupational adjustments:** Short-term workplace accommodations (e.g., gradual exposure to social tasks) to prevent career setbacks.  \n5. **Collaborative care:** Involve primary care to address concerns about dismissed symptoms and coordinate referrals for specialized CBT.  \n\nThe focus is on validating your experience, reducing avoidance cycles, and restoring confidence in social contexts.",
