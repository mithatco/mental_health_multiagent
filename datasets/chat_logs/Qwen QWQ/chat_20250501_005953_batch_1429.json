The key points here are the intense anxiety in social situations, avoidance of social interactions, physical symptoms like shaking and blushing, and the panic attacks. The user also mentioned not feeling heard by their partner, which adds to their distress. They denied any suicidal thoughts, which is important.\n\nThe main diagnosis here seems clear: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The avoidance, physical symptoms, and panic attacks all align with that. But I should check if there's anything else. The user also mentioned feeling down in meetings, but that's context-specific. Maybe they have GAD too, but since the anxiety is tied to social situations, SAD is primary.\n\nI need to make sure there's no sign of psychosis. They said no to hearing voices or others reading thoughts, so that's out. The physical symptoms are tied to social anxiety, not a separate somatic disorder unless they're overly preoccupied, but the question about others not taking symptoms seriously points more to SAD with somatic expressions.\n\nThe panic attacks in social settings could also point to Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, but since the panic is situation-specific (social), SAD covers that better. Also, they don't mention panic outside of social contexts.\n\nNext steps should include CBT, SSRIs, and interpersonal therapy. Maybe suggest tracking triggers. Need to mention the importance of validating their symptoms to counteract their partner's dismissal. \n\nWait, the instructions require specific formatting. I need to ensure all medical terms are in med tags, symptoms in sym, and quotes in quote. Also, follow the structure exactly. Let me structure the summary to reflect their struggle, then list the diagnosis with SAD, explain why with DSM-5 criteria, and then list next steps clearly. Make sure not to use markdown, just plain text with tags.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the patient's responses one by one. The user provided answers to the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure questions. My job is to analyze these answers to identify the main symptoms, patterns, potential clinical areas, risks, and summarize them.\n\nFirst, I need to look for the main symptoms. The patient mentions feeling less interest in social activities but okay alone. That could point towards social anxiety. They also talk about feeling down during work meetings, but not all the time, so maybe some depressive symptoms but not pervasive. The irritability mentioned is more like being on edge, which could be anxiety. \n\nSleep issues: They stay up late and are tired, not energetic, so that's more insomnia leading to fatigue rather than a manic symptom. \n\nAvoiding projects or risky things suggests avoidance behaviors, which is a big sign for anxiety, especially social. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are really prominent here. They mention being nervous, anxious, on edge, and even panic attacks. The physical symptoms like shaking hands, blushing, sweating, trembling, and a churning stomach in social settings are classic for social anxiety disorder. \n\nThey also report avoiding social situations, which reinforces that. The patient feels their symptoms are dismissed by their partner, which adds a layer of possible isolation or lack of support. They also mention wishing to hide better, which might indicate distress but no self-harm thoughts, so that's a positive note. \n\nThere's no mention of psychosis (no voices, though they have paranoid thoughts like people judging them, but that's more cognitive distortions common in anxiety). \n\nLooking for patterns: The responses consistently point towards social interactions triggering anxiety. The patient uses phrases like \"if they involve other people\" leading to avoidance, physical symptoms in social settings, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. They also mention counting people in a room before entering, which could be compulsive or a ritual to manage anxiety.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Social Anxiety Disorder is the primary one here. The avoidance, physical symptoms, panic attacks, and social withdrawal all align with that. They might also have a mild depressive component, but it's more situational around social interactions. The somatic symptoms (aches, sweating, etc.) are exacerbated in social contexts, so that's part of the anxiety.\n\nClinical significance areas: Social anxiety disorder, possible generalized anxiety disorder (since they mention being anxious all the time), but the context is social. Panic disorder with agoraphobia might be considered given the panic attacks and avoidance, but the avoidance is more about social situations specifically, so that's more SAD. The somatic symptoms are part of the anxiety manifestation. \n\nRisk factors: The patient has panic attacks, which are a risk factor for worsening anxiety. The physical symptoms they experience might lead to social isolation. They also express that their partner dismisses their symptoms, which could worsen their condition due to lack of support. There's no indication of suicidal ideation, so that's a lower risk. \n\nNow, I need to structure this into the required sections. \n\nMain symptoms: Social avoidance, somatic symptoms in social contexts, panic attacks, irritability/anxiety, depressive symptoms in specific situations. \n\nPatterns: Symptoms are triggered by social interactions, use of avoidance as a coping strategy, physical manifestations, and reports of perceived invalidation by others. \n\nPotential areas: Social Anxiety Disorder, maybe GAD, Panic Disorder (though more tied to social aspects), and possible adjustment issues due to the environment. \n\nRisk factors: Panic attacks and possible social isolation. The patient's reassurance about not having suicidal thoughts is good, but the somatic symptoms could lead to health anxiety if not addressed.\n\nPutting this into clinical terms without speculation. Make sure to highlight the key points from each question and connect them to disorders. Avoid mentioning things not in the data. For example, no substance use mentioned, so don't include that. \n\nAlso, note the patient's self-report of feeling judged, which is part of the social anxiety. The counting and checking before entering a room could be safety behaviors, but maybe not OCD unless it's more compulsive. The user didn't mention OCD traits beyond the counting, so maybe just note as safety behaviors.\n\nOkay, time to structure the answer as per the instructions: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risks, and a summary.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social Avoidance/Anxiety**: Avoidance of social interactions (e.g., meetings, gatherings, presentations), heightened anxiety in social settings, and ritualistic behaviors (e.g., counting people in rooms before entering).  \n- **Physical Somatic Symptoms**: Trembling, blushing, sweating, shaky voice, and gastrointestinal distress in social contexts.  \n- **Panic Attacks**: Acute episodes of panic (e.g., during inescapable social situations like a restaurant).  \n- **Anhedonia (Socially Specific)**: Reduced pleasure/interest in activities requiring social engagement.  \n- **Dysphoric Mood**: Transient feelings of sadness/ hopelessness in specific contexts (e.g., work meetings).  \n- **Hyperarousal/ Autonomic Symptoms**: Restlessness, tension, and sleep disturbance (late nights followed by fatigue).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Social Context Triggers**: Symptoms (anxiety, avoidance, somatic reactions) are consistently linked to interpersonal/social demands.  \n- **Self-Criticism and Minimization**: Patient questions validity of symptoms (\"Do others do that?\" \"Maybe I\u2019m overreacting?\"), suggesting potential shame or doubt about symptom severity.  \n- **Coping Mechanisms**: Avoidance, withdrawal, and safety behaviors (e.g., avoiding eye contact, delaying entry into social spaces).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Marked fear/avoidance of social scrutiny, anticipatory anxiety, and physiological reactivity in social situations.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Chronic anxiety about social/performance situations.  \n- **Panic Disorder with Social Triggers**: Panic attacks in social/evaluative contexts.  \n- **Physical Comorbidities**: Somatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, tremors) exacerbated by anxiety.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs**  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Avoidance impacts occupational functioning (e.g., skipping work meetings, labeled as \"quiet\" by colleagues).  \n- **Perceived Invalidation**: Patient reports dismissal of symptoms by partner, potentially exacerbating distress.  \n- **Safety Concerns**: No self-harm ideation reported, but significant somatic distress and social withdrawal.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language)**  \nThe patient presents with prominent **social anxiety disorder** symptoms, including avoidant behavior, anticipatory anxiety, and somatic reactivity in evaluative social contexts. Secondary features include mild dysphoric mood in performance situations, hyperarousal (tension, insomnia), and panic attacks triggered by unavoidable social exposure. The patient\u2019s pattern of symptom exacerbation in interpersonal interactions, coupled with maladaptive coping (avoidance), suggests significant impairment in social/occupational functioning. No psychotic features noted (denies hallucinations). Risk of secondary depression or worsening social isolation is plausible if untreated. Patient\u2019s self-doubt about symptom legitimacy and perceived invalidation by others may hinder help-seeking or response to treatment. Clinical priority areas: SAD, comorbid GAD, and targeted intervention for social performance anxiety.",

      "explanations": {
        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains, including depression, anxiety, anger, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. However, some domains like repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, and personality functioning were not directly explored. The therapist could have probed deeper into certain areas, such as substance use and psychotic symptoms, but overall coverage was good.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were instances of slight inaccuracies or vague phrasing. For example, when asking about somatic symptoms, the therapist could have been more specific about the types of aches and pains. However, the questions were mostly clinically relevant and targeted symptoms accurately.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up appropriately on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's panic attacks and avoidance behaviors. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies, such as not directly addressing the patient's ritualistic behaviors earlier.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, including avoidance of social situations, physiological symptoms during social demands, and panic attacks. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria and provided a clear rationale for the specifiers (performance-type features and limited prosocial reinforcement). Alternative diagnoses like Generalized Anxiety Disorder were considered and ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist showed empathy and a natural conversational style, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. However, there were minor moments where the therapist seemed slightly impersonal or robotic, such as when asking about sensitive topics like suicidal ideation. Overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation was well-structured and effectively addressed most DSM-5 domains. The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone, and the diagnostic justification was clear and sound. However, there were minor areas for improvement, such as deeper exploration of certain domains and more precise language in some questions. Overall, the therapist performed well, but a perfect score would require flawless execution across all criteria.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes significant distress tied to social interactions, including <sym>avoidance of gatherings</sym>, <sym>physiological symptoms during social demands</sym> (e.g., trembling, blushing), and <sym>panic attacks</sym> in evaluative settings. Their <sym>dread of judgment</sym> (e.g., fearing others notice their shaking or \"laughing at them\") and <sym>insomnia</sym> linked to stress are deeply impactful. The <quote>\"counting people in a room before entering\"</quote> highlights ritualistic behaviors to manage anxiety, while <quote>\"my partner says I\u2019m overreacting\"</quote> underscores perceived invalidation compounding their distress. Their efforts to cope through avoidance have strained occupational engagement, yet they express a strong desire to manage these challenges without feeling \"weak.\"  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-5 300.22) with **specifiers**:  \n- **Performance-type features** (e.g., panic during meetings/presentations).  \n- **Limited prosocial reinforcement** in their environment (e.g., dismissal of symptoms by partner).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient\u2019s <sym>avoidance of social/performative situations</sym>, <sym>somatic reactivity</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> align with DSM-5 criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Their <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym> (e.g., counting people before entering rooms) reflect safety-seeking strategies common in SAD. While <sym>dysphoric mood</sym> occurs in social contexts, it does not meet criteria for major depression. No evidence of delusions or hallucinations (<med>psychosis</med> ruled out). <sym>Hyperarousal</sym> (trembling, sleep disruption) and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> are better explained by social anxiety\u2019s physiological stress response than standalone somatic symptom disorder. The \"limited prosocial\" specifier is noted due to their reports of colleagues labeling them \"quiet,\" suggesting interpersonal withdrawal.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** targeting <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, with a focus on exposure therapy for feared social/performance scenarios.  \n2. **SSRI Trial**: Sertraline or escitalopram (start low-dose) to mitigate <sym>somatic reactivity</sym> and anticipatory anxiety.  \n3. **Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)** to address social withdrawal and perceived invalidationion by their partner (e.g., joint sessions to improve communication).  \n4. **Daily Symptom Monitoring**: Track physical triggers (e.g., heart rate, avoidance episodes) to identify patterns.  \n5. **Education**: Normalize <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> as common in social anxiety; provide resources on cognitive restructuring for feared judgments.  \n\n**Note:** Rule out <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> via follow-up if <sym>worry</sym> broadens beyond social contexts.",
