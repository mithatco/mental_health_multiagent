I need to structure my response exactly as specified. \n\nFirst, I need to write a compassionate summary. The patient is experiencing panic attacks, avoidance, and has been dismissed by medical professionals. I should acknowledge their struggles empathetically.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The key symptoms are panic attacks, agoraphobia, and avoidance. The DSM-5 criteria for Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia fit here. Let me check the criteria again. Recurrent panic attacks, fear of them, and avoidance. Yes, that's covered.\n\nReasoning section: I need to explain why Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia is the primary diagnosis. Mention the panic attacks' frequency, physical symptoms like chest tightness, and avoidance behaviors. Also, note the absence of depressive or psychotic symptoms. The GAD could be comorbid, but panic is the main driver.\n\nTreatment steps: CBT with exposure therapy for panic and agoraphobia, maybe SSRIs, collaboration with primary care to address past medical dismissal, and psychoeducation about panic physiology. Also, sleep hygiene for insomnia.\n\nWait, the user specified to use the exact section titles with asterisks. Need to make sure headings are exactly **Diagnosis**, etc. Also, use the tags for medical terms and symptoms. Let me ensure all parts are addressed and formatted correctly. No markdown except for the tags. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\nYou\u2019ve described a deeply challenging experience of living with intense fear and physical distress during panic attacks, coupled with the exhausting cycle of avoiding situations that trigger your anxiety. Your description of withdrawing from relationships, work, and social activities because of this fear highlights how it\u2019s eroded your sense of safety in the world. The way you\u2019ve described your body\u2019s physical reactions\u2014heart-pounding, breathlessness, dizziness\u2014must be terrifying, and it sounds like the uncertainty around these symptoms left you feeling unheard after your ER visit.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to go through the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire and analyze their answers as a mental health professional. Let me start by reading through each question and answer again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nFirst question was about lack of interest or pleasure. The patient says they've been avoiding things they used to enjoy, like socializing or work, because they're scared of having an attack. They mention it's a few days a week. That sounds like anhedonia, which is common in depression, but the avoidance due to fear of panic attacks might point more towards an anxiety disorder.\n\nSecond question on feeling down or hopeless: the patient doesn't feel hopeless overall but has days of feeling trapped by fear. So maybe depressive symptoms are present but not the primary issue. The anxiety seems to be causing the low moods.\n\nThird, feeling irritable: yes, they snap at their partner over little things, several days a week. Irritability is a symptom of anxiety disorders as well, so that's consistent with the other symptoms.\n\nFourth question about sleeping less but having energy: the patient says they have trouble sleeping but lack energy. That's more like insomnia but with fatigue, which can be part of anxiety or depression.\n\nFifth question on starting more projects or risky behavior: no, they've been withdrawing. Opposite of what the question suggests, which is more mania, so probably not a bipolar issue here.\n\nSixth, feeling nervous, anxious, on edge: almost every day. That's a key indicator of generalized anxiety, but considering the panic attacks mentioned later, this might be part of panic disorder.\n\nSeventh, panic or fear: several times a week, with physical symptoms like heart-pounding, can't breathe. Definitely points to panic attacks.\n\nEighth, avoiding situations: avoiding crowded places, subways, driving. That's classic avoidance behavior seen in panic disorder with agoraphobia.\n\nNinth, unexplained aches: chest tightness and dizziness during attacks. The physical symptoms are part of panic attacks, which they confirmed have been checked medically.\n\nTenth, feeling their illness isn't taken seriously: they felt dismissed after an ER visit. This could affect their treatment adherence or trust in medical professionals.\n\nEleventh, self-harm thoughts: no, but fear of dying during attacks. Suicidal thoughts aren't present, which is good, but the fear of physical symptoms is significant.\n\nTwelfth and thirteenth about hearing voices or mind-reading: no, so psychotic symptoms aren't present. The racing thoughts are their own, so not a psychotic disorder.\n\nNow, putting this together: The main symptoms are the panic attacks with physical symptoms, avoidance behaviors leading to agoraphobia, irritability, anhedonia, insomnia, and generalized anxiety. The patient is experiencing significant distress and functional impairment, especially in social and occupational areas. The fear of attacks leading to avoidance is a key feature of panic disorder with agoraphobia. The ER experience adds a layer of potential distrust in medical care. The lack of suicidal ideation is important to note, but the fear of dying during panic attacks is a concern that needs to be addressed to prevent potential worsening or complications. \n\nPotential diagnoses to consider: Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, possibly GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) due to the constant anxiety, but the panic attacks and avoidance are central here. The anhedonia and irritability might be secondary to the anxiety rather than a depressive disorder, but it's worth noting. The physical symptoms (chest tightness, dizziness) are part of the panic attacks. The patient's response about not feeling heard by the ER might contribute to their anxiety or help-seeking behavior.\n\nRisks: The avoidance is already impacting their life, and if not addressed, could lead to worsening agoraphobia and social isolation. The high frequency of panic attacks (several times a week) suggests they might need immediate intervention. The dismissal by the ER could also lead to reluctance to seek help in the future, so building trust in the therapeutic relationship is important.\n\nI should structure the summary into the five parts the user asked for. Make sure to use clinical terms like panic attacks, agoraphobic avoidance, etc. Highlight the main symptoms, note the patterns like the frequency of panic attacks and avoidance, clinical significance related to panic disorder, risk factors like avoidance behaviors, and summarize concisely.\n\nWait, the question also asks to note patterns. The patient reports symptoms occurring a few days a week for some, almost daily for others. The progression from panic attacks to avoidance is a pattern. The physical symptoms during panic episodes are consistent with DSM-5 criteria for panic attacks. The irritability and insomnia are common comorbid symptoms in anxiety disorders. The feeling of not being taken seriously is a social/relational pattern affecting their experience of healthcare.\n\nClinical significance points: recurrent panic attacks (frequency), agoraphobic avoidance (significant impairment), moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (question 6 is almost daily), and the impact on occupational/social functioning. The lack of suicidal intent is a positive point but the fear of dying during panic attacks needs attention to prevent escalation.\n\nRisk factors: High frequency of panic attacks, ongoing avoidance leading to worsening disability, potential distrust in medical care. No current self-harm intent, but the somatic fears could lead to increased anxiety or somatic symptom disorder, but since the physical symptoms are tied to panic, it's more panic disorder.\n\nPutting it all together now. Need to make sure not to include my own speculation, just what's in the answers. The summary should be concise, professional, using terms like \"recurrent panic attacks,\" \"agoraphobic avoidance behaviors,\" \"anhedonia,\" \"interoceptive sensitivity,\" etc.\n\nWait, the question says to avoid speculation, so just stick to what's there. The ER dismissal is part of their experience and their feeling of being not taken seriously, which is a concern in terms of their help-seeking behavior and trust.\n\nOkay, time to structure the five sections as per instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- Recurrent panic attacks (several times weekly) with somatic symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, dyspnea, chest tightness, dizziness).  \n- Agoraphobic avoidance of public places (e.g., subways, crowded areas) and social withdrawal (e.g., avoiding work, family plans).  \n- Persistent anxiety (almost daily) characterized by hypervigilance, irritability, and fear of catastrophic outcomes (e.g., fear of cardiac arrest or fainting).  \n- Anhedonia (moderate; reduced engagement in previously enjoyed activities due to anxiety).  \n- Sleep disturbance (insomnia with fatigue, not associated with excessive energy).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms cluster around fear of panic attacks and their sequelae (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, avoidance, hypervigilance).  \n- Physical symptoms during panic attacks are well-described and medically ruled out, consistent with *interoceptive sensitivity*.  \n- Functional impairment reported in social, occupational, and familial roles (e.g., missing work, strained relationships.  \n- Emotional dysregulation (irritability) correlates with anxiety severity.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia:** Hallmark features include recurrent panic attacks, avoidance of feared environments, and functional impairment.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent, nearly daily anxiety about panic symptom exacerbation and catastrophic outcomes.  \n- **Health Anxiety:** Concerns about being dismissed by medical professionals (Q10) may reflect mistrust in healthcare and reinforce panicogenic fears.  \n- **Social/Relational Strain:** Reported interpersonal conflict due to irritability and withdrawal.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- High symptom frequency (panic attacks, daily anxiety) and escalating avoidance behaviors risk worsening disability.  \n- History of medical dismissal (Q10) may hinder engagement in care or adherence to treatment.  \n- Somatic preoccupation (e.g., fearing cardiac events during panic) requires monitoring for somatic symptom disorder comorbidity.  \n- No suicidal ideation (Q11), but intense fear of bodily harm during attacks may necessitate reassurance and grounding strategies.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with **recurrent panic attacks with marked somatic symptoms (DSM-5 criterion A for Panic Disorder)** and **agoraphobic avoidance (criterion B/C)**, consistent with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia. Secondary features include **anhedonia**, **sleep disturbance**, and **intermittent irritability**, likely exacerbated by anticipatory anxiety. **Functional impairment** is notable in social, occupational, and relational domains due to avoidance and symptom-related hypervigilance. **Healthcare distrust** (Q10) may require therapeutic normalization of symptoms and collaborative care coordination. No evidence of psychotic symptoms (Q12/Q13) or suicidal intent (Q11), though somatic fears require validation. Interventions should prioritize panic management (e.g., CBT for panic, interoceptive exposure), anxiolytic or SSRIs, and safety planning to address avoidance and functional decline.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve described a deeply challenging experience of living with intense fear and physical distress during panic attacks, coupled with the exhausting cycle of avoiding situations that trigger your anxiety. Your description of withdrawing from relationships, work, and social activities because of this fear highlights how it\u2019s eroded your sense of safety in the world. The way you\u2019ve described your body\u2019s physical reactions\u2014heart-pounding, breathlessness, dizziness\u2014must be terrifying, and it sounds like the uncertainty around these symptoms left you feeling unheard after your ER visit. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve felt dismissed; your symptoms are valid, and we can work to help you reclaim control over your life.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> (with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features), supported by recurrent panic attacks, avoidance of feared environments, and <sym>interoceptive symptoms</sym> (e.g., chest tightness). <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are secondary to anxiety severity.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia:** Meets DSM-5 criteria via recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q1, Q2, Q7), <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> to prevent feared situations (Q8), e.g., avoiding subways), and clinically significant distress/impairment.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** Persistent <sym>worry about panic recurrence</sym> (Q6, Q10) and hypervigilance align with GAD criteria, though panic disorder is the primary driver.  \n- **No Major Depression:** While <sym>anhedonia</sym> and low mood (Q1, Q2) are present, they\u2019re better explained by <med>panic symptoms</med> rather than a primary depressive disorder.  \n- **No Psychosis/Suicidality:** Denies hallucinations (Q12/Q13), and no <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11), though <sym>existential fears</sym> of dying during panic attacks require normalization.  \n- **Physical symptoms (Q9): chest tightness, dizziness) are panic-related, not somatic symptom disorder, as they align with panic episodes.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting panic/agoraphobia:** Focus on <sym>exposure therapy</sym> to gradually confront feared situations (e.g., gradual subway rides) and cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m having a heart attack\u201d).  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., escitalopram) or <med>benzodiazepines</med> (short-term for acute panic).  \n3. **Collaborative medical reassurance:** Provide a letter to primary care outlining the diagnosis to address concerns about past dismissive care (Q10).  \n4. **Sleep hygiene protocol:** Address insomnia via <sym>stimulant restriction</sym>, scheduled relaxation techniques, and monitoring for <med>medication</med> if needed.  \n5. **Safety planning:** Develop a panic attack coping toolkit (grounding exercises, breathing techniques) to reduce <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym>.  \n\nLet me know if I can clarify anything. You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014effective treatment exists, and we can build a plan tailored to your needs.",
