      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this step by step. The user provided a detailed scenario where they need a mental health assessment based on a questionnaire. The user's response includes answers to 10 questions, each with their answers. My job is to analyze those answers and structure the response exactly as specified.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the provided answers carefully. The user mentioned avoiding social situations, panic attacks in crowds, physical symptoms like stomach issues and throat tightness, and how this is affecting their work (like declining a presentation). They also feel others don't take their physical symptoms seriously. \n\nThe key points here are the social avoidance, panic attacks when around people, and the impact on their job. They don't mention low mood outside of social contexts, so maybe it's more anxiety-related rather than depression. The panic attacks in social situations point towards social anxiety, but there's also the panic attacks with physical symptoms. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a strong contender here. The DSM-5 criteria for SAD include fear of social situations due to fear of scrutiny, which aligns with their answers. The panic attacks could be part of SAD with panic attack specifier or a separate Panic Disorder. But since the panic is tied to social situations, SAD is more likely. \n\nThe user also mentioned they don't feel depressed normally but do when facing social events. That suggests the anxiety is the primary issue. The somatic symptoms like stomach aches and throat tightness are common in anxiety, especially in social contexts. \n\nThe user's avoidance of work-related social demands (e.g., presentations) indicates functional impairment, which is needed for a diagnosis. The DSM-5 requires that symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, which is clearly present here. \n\nI need to structure the answer with four sections: compassionate summary, diagnosis, reasoning, and next steps. The tags have to be properly placed. Let me check the structure again. The first paragraph should be a compassionate summary, then the headings exactly as specified. \n\nWait, the user emphasized not to make assumptions beyond the responses provided. They didn't mention trauma, so PTSD is less likely. The panic attacks are situational (social settings), so Panic Disorder due to SAD. The key is linking the panic attacks to social triggers. \n\nThe diagnosis should be Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. The reasoning must link each symptom to DSM-5 criteria. The recommended steps should include CBT, possibly SSRIs, tracking symptoms, and a medical check to rule out physical causes for the somatic symptoms. \n\nMake sure to use the tags correctly. For example, \"panic attacks\" as symptoms, \"Social Anxiety Disorder\" as a med term. The summary should empathize with their experience of overwhelm in social situations and the impact on work. \n\nCheck that all required sections are present and in order. Diagnosis section has to have the exact heading with asterisks. Let me structure each part step by step to ensure nothing is missed.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms like social avoidance, panic attacks in social settings, and somatic distress</sym> are clearly impacting your daily life, <sym>leading to occupational withdrawal and physical discomfort</sym>. It sounds deeply challenging to navigate situations that require social engagement, and the burden of managing these fears alone must be overwhelming. Your efforts to be honest about your struggles are commendable, and it\u2019s important to prioritize support to reduce this distress.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with <med>panic attack specifier</med>, and <med>somatic symptom exacerbation</med> in social/performance contexts.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>SAD</med> is supported by <sym>marked fear of social scrutiny</sym> (e.g., avoiding presentations, dreading calls), <sym>functional impairment in work/social roles</sym>, and <sym>physical reactions (e.g., stomach knots, throat tightness)</sym> when stressed.  \n- The panic attacks (<sym>sudden tachycardia, need to flee crowded settings</sym>) align with the panic attack specifier when linked to social/performance triggers.  \n- <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> (e.g., stomach aches during stress) may reflect somatic manifestation of anxiety rather than a separate <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>, given their clear contextual link to anxiety triggers.  \n- No evidence of trauma history; symptoms focus on social/performance contexts, ruling out <med>PTSD</med>.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety with gradual exposure exercises and cognitive restructuring for catastrophic thinking (e.g., \"My job presentation will make me humiliated\").  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider a <med>serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., escitalopram)</med> to reduce baseline anxiety and panic reactivity.  \n3. **Panic Attack Management:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing and grounding techniques to use during attacks (e.g., when entering crowds).  \n4. **Functional Restoration:** Work with a therapist to address work-avoidance patterns (e.g., declining presentations) through role-playing and exposure hierarchies.  \n5. **Medical Evaluation:** Rule out hyperventilation or GI disorders causing somatic symptoms, though these are likely anxiety-mediated.  \n6. **Supportive Psychoeducation:** Normalize panic attacks as common in SAD and address misbeliefs (\"others think I\u2019m weak for avoiding social events\").  \n\nThis framework balances addressing core anxiety, improving social functioning, and validating your experiences without minimizing the very real toll this has taken. You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014many respond well to targeted interventions, and early treatment can prevent long-term avoidance patterns.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the patient's responses to the DSM-5 self-rated questionnaire. Let's start by going through each question and answer to identify the main symptoms and concerns.\n\nFirst, the patient mentions that they still enjoy hobbies at home but lose interest in social activities. That seems like a social avoidance pattern. They also feel down or hopeless when they have to attend social events, which could be linked to social anxiety. Irritability when around others is mentioned, which might be a sign of anxiety rather than anger. The sleep issues point to insomnia due to anxiety, not the hyper-arousal described in the question. The lack of starting projects or risky behaviors suggests they avoid social situations by sticking to routines.\n\nThe strong indicators here are the anxiety symptoms: feeling nervous, having panic attacks in crowded places, and avoiding situations that cause anxiety. The panic attacks and avoidance are key. They also report physical symptoms like stomach knots and a tight throat during social stress, which are common in anxiety disorders.\n\nLooking for patterns, the patient's symptoms all revolve around social interactions causing significant distress. They avoid social events, have panic in those situations, and experience both emotional and physical symptoms as a result. The hopelessness only comes from social failures, which might indicate that their self-esteem is tied to their social anxiety.\n\nPotential clinical areas here could be Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or Panic Disorder. The avoidance behaviors are a big red flag for social anxiety. The panic attacks in specific situations (crowded rooms) might point to a specific phobia or social phobia. The somatic symptoms like stomach issues and panic attacks are clinically significant. The fact that they turned down a job presentation due to anxiety shows functional impairment in their work life, which is a major concern.\n\nRisk factors include the panic attacks and avoidance leading to social withdrawal, which can exacerbate anxiety. The patient's functional impairment in work because they avoid necessary tasks is a warning sign. They also mention not wanting to admit how often panic attacks happen; maybe there's an element of underreporting, which could indicate severity.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything. The patient's physical symptoms during social stress are important. They also report overthinking emails and dread of calls, which are anxiety symptoms. The key points are the social anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and resulting impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\nSo putting this together, the main diagnosis to consider is Social Anxiety Disorder with possible Panic Disorder or Specific Phobia (social situations). The avoidance and panic attacks are central here. The physical symptoms align with anxiety-related responses. The patient's functional impairment is clear, which is a DSM-5 criterion for many anxiety disorders. No mention of suicidal thoughts, so maybe no immediate risk there, but the anxiety is impacting their life significantly.\n\nI should structure the response as the user asked: main symptoms, patterns, areas of significance, risk factors, and a summary. Need to use clinical terms like \"social avoidance,\" \"panic attacks,\" \"functional impairment,\" and \"somatic symptoms.\" Avoid speculation, just stick to what's reported.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Avoidance/Anxiety:** Marked avoidance of social interactions (e.g., skipping gatherings, declining job presentations), with preserved interest in solitary activities.  \n- **Panic Attacks:** Episodic panic (e.g., crowded stores) with somatic symptoms (tachycardia, need to flee).  \n- **Social Performance Avoidance:** Functional impairment in work/social roles due to anxiety-driven avoidance.  \n- **Physical Somatic Symptoms:** Gastrointestinal distress (stomach knots) and throat tightness during social stress.  \n- **Anxiety-Related Hyperarousal:** Overthinking communications (emails/calls), restlessness, and edge.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Contextual Triggers:** Symptoms intensify in social/performance situations (e.g., meetings, gatherings).  \n- **Avoidance as Coping:** Systematic withdrawal from anxiety-provoking scenarios, including occupational demands.  \n- **Self-Reported Shame:** Acknowledgment of underreporting panic episodes (\"don\u2019t want to admit how often\").  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Primary consideration due to pervasive fear of social evaluation and functional avoidance.  \n- **Panic Disorder with/without Agoraphobia:** Panic attacks triggered by social/performance contexts, with avoidance behavior.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry (e.g., over emails) and physical hyperarousal.  \n- **Occupational Impairment:** Avoidance of work-related social demands (e.g., presentations).  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance impacting work performance and social engagement.  \n- **Underreporting of Symptoms:** Suggests possible symptom minimization or stigma concerns.  \n- **Physical Somatic Symptoms:** Gastrointestinal/neck tension may exacerbate anxiety or reflect somatization.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with **marked social anxiety, panic attacks in performance/social contexts, and avoidance behaviors**, consistent with a primary differential of **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)** with features of **panic attacks**. Symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for SAD (e.g., fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and functional impairment). Secondary considerations include **GAD** (persistent anxiety and hyperarousal) and **specific phobia** (social/performance triggers). **Somatic symptoms** (gastrointestinal distress, tachycardia) corroborate anxiety pathology. **Risk factors** include occupational and social role impairment, potential symptom underreporting, and physical comorbidity. Further assessment should evaluate avoidance frequency/severity, trauma history, and coping strategies.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Symptoms like social avoidance, panic attacks in social settings, and somatic distress</sym> are clearly impacting your daily life, <sym>leading to occupational withdrawal and physical discomfort</sym>. It sounds deeply challenging to navigate situations that require social engagement, and the burden of managing these fears alone must be overwhelming. Your efforts to be honest about your struggles are commendable, and it\u2019s important to prioritize support to reduce this distress.  \n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with <med>panic attack specifier</med>, and <med>somatic symptom exacerbation</med> in social/performance contexts.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>SAD</med> is supported by <sym>marked fear of social scrutiny</sym> (e.g., avoiding presentations, dreading calls), <sym>functional impairment in work/social roles</sym>, and <sym>physical reactions (e.g., stomach knots, throat tightness)</sym> when stressed.  \n- The panic attacks (<sym>sudden tachycardia, need to flee crowded settings</sym>) align with the panic attack specifier when linked to social/performance triggers.  \n- <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> (e.g., stomach aches during stress) may reflect somatic manifestation of anxiety rather than a separate <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>, given their clear contextual link to anxiety triggers.  \n- No evidence of trauma history; symptoms focus on social/performance contexts, ruling out <med>PTSD</med>.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety with gradual exposure exercises and cognitive restructuring for catastrophic thinking (e.g., \"My job presentation will make me humiliated\").  \n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider a <med>serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., escitalopram)</med> to reduce baseline anxiety and panic reactivity.  \n3. **Panic Attack Management:** Teach diaphragmatic breathing and grounding techniques to use during attacks (e.g., when entering crowds).  \n4. **Functional Restoration:** Work with a therapist to address work-avoidance patterns (e.g., declining presentations) through role-playing and exposure hierarchies.  \n5. **Medical Evaluation:** Rule out hyperventilation or GI disorders causing somatic symptoms, though these are likely anxiety-mediated.  \n6. **Supportive Psychoeducation:** Normalize panic attacks as common in SAD and address misbeliefs (\"others think I\u2019m weak for avoiding social events\").  \n\nThis framework balances addressing core anxiety, improving social functioning, and validating your experiences without minimizing the very real toll this has taken. You\u2019re not alone in this\u2014many respond well to targeted interventions, and early treatment can prevent long-term avoidance patterns.",
