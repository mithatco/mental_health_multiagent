      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed case with the patient's responses and clinical notes. I need to structure the response according to their strict format. \n\nFirst, the compassionate summary: I should acknowledge the patient's struggles with empathy, highlighting their reported symptoms without jargon. Use the tags for quotes and symptoms where appropriate.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section. The main symptoms are psychosis (voices, paranoia), depression, and anxiety. The key here is deciding between major depressive disorder with psychotic features or a psychotic disorder. The hallucinations and delusions are prominent, so maybe a psychotic disorder. But the depressive symptoms are also significant. Schizoaffective disorder? Let me check DSM-5 criteria. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 specifies that for schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic symptoms must persist when mood symptoms are in remission. Since the patient has both, but the history isn't fully clear, maybe provisional. Alternatively, psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) or brief psychotic episode? Also, the Somatic Symptom Disorder was mentioned in the references, but the patient's symptoms are more about psychosis and depression, so SSD might not fit here. The patient's stopping meds abruptly is a concern. \n\nThe user emphasized not to use SSD unless clear, so probably not here. The primary diagnosis would be something like \"Schizophreniform Disorder\" or \"Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features.\" But the depression is chronic and the psychosis is prominent. Alternatively, maybe a psychotic disorder with depressive features. Need to see which criteria fit better.\n\nLooking at the answers, the patient has been experiencing these symptoms for a while? The time frame is two weeks. The duration for schizophrenia requires at least a month, but schizophreniform is if it's longer than a month but less than six months. Since the timeframe here is two weeks, maybe a provisional diagnosis of \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" if there's a stressor, but the patient didn't mention a recent stressor. Alternatively, if the symptoms are part of a major depressive episode with psychotic features, that's possible. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features requires the presence of depressive symptoms plus hallucinations/delusions. The patient's quotes about voices and paranoia align. But the paranoia might be more delusional. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria for that. \n\nAlternatively, if the psychotic symptoms are not entirely accounted for by another mental disorder, then Schizophreniform or Schizoaffective. Since the depressive symptoms are present, but the psychosis isn't entirely secondary to mood, maybe a primary psychotic disorder with comorbid depression. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the mood disorder and psychosis are overlapping. The patient reports stopping antidepressants, which might have worsened symptoms. \n\nWait, the user's additional reference mentioned \"attenuated psychosis syndrome\" as a potential risk for developing psychosis. But the patient is already experiencing clear hallucinations and delusions, so it's beyond attenuated. \n\nPutting this together, the most fitting might be **Schizophreniform Disorder** given the presence of hallucinations and delusions with significant impairment, but given the depressive symptoms, maybe **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type** (though the depressive features here might align more with the depressive type). Wait, but schizoaffective requires a period of mood symptoms without psychotic features, which isn't clear here. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)** if criteria aren't fully met. But given the severity of symptoms, perhaps **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**. The DSM-5 does include that as a specifier. Let me confirm: \n\nMajor Depressive Disorder with psychotic features (like delusions or hallucinations) would be the diagnosis if the depression and psychosis are concurrent and the psychosis occurs exclusively during mood episodes. The patient's description of voices and paranoia coinciding with mood symptoms might fit here. \n\nHowever, the paranoid thoughts (e.g., neighbor being part of a conspiracy, TV messages) might be delusions, which are more characteristic of schizophrenia. The presence of both mood and psychotic symptoms complicates it. \n\nThe patient's mention of stopping medication abruptly could exacerbate symptoms. Given the timeframe of two weeks, maybe they're experiencing an acute episode. \n\nThe user's references mention attenuated psychosis syndrome, but since symptoms are overt, it's beyond that. \n\nPutting it together, the primary diagnosis would be **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**. Alternatively, if the psychosis is primary, Schizophreniform Disorder. \n\nWait, but the DSM-5 allows for a depressive episode with psychotic features. Let me check the criteria again. The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Episode with Psychotic Features requires the presence of delusions, hallucinations, or other psychotic symptoms (excluding mood-congruent delusions). The patient's voices are congruent (e.g., voices telling them not to hurt themselves), but the paranoid delusions (neighbors, TV messages) are non-mood congruent. So that would fit. \n\nTherefore, the diagnosis would be: \n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>, with associated <sym>paranoid delusions</sym> and <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>. However, the patient's symptoms also raise consideration of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med>), particularly if the psychosis persists beyond the mood episode. The distinction requires further evaluation of symptom chronology and duration.  \n\nBut given the self-reported depression and the psychosis occurring alongside, and the time frame of two weeks, maybe the former is primary. However, the user's references mention the consideration of attenuated psychosis but in this case, it's full-blown. \n\nAlternatively, the combination of both might point to schizoaffective. The key is whether the mood episode is predominant. Schizoaffective requires that the mood disturbance is not brief relative to the disturbance. Since this is only two weeks, maybe it's too short to meet criteria, so the provisional Dx might be Major Depressive with Psychotic features, with psychotic disorder NOS as a differential.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me go step by step. \n\nThe patient's answers include clear hallucinations and delusions. The DSM-5 criteria for Schizophreniform require at least two weeks of active-phase symptoms (delusions/hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or catatonia) with significant functional impairment. The patient's symptoms meet active symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), impaired functioning (avoiding public places, social withdrawal). So Schizophreniform could fit. \n\nBut the presence of depressive symptoms (Q3 and Q7) must be considered. Schizoaffective requires the mood disorder to be concurrent with active psychotic symptoms. Since the depressive symptoms are present alongside psychosis, schizoaffective might be possible. However, the duration requirement for schizoaffective is that the mood episodes occur concurrently with delusions/hallucinations for a substantial portion, which may be the case here. \n\nThe patient's stopping meds could have exacerbated symptoms. \n\nSince the time frame is two weeks, and the criteria for schizoaffective requires at least two weeks of symptoms, but for schizoaffective specifically, the depressive episode must be present for the majority of the time. It's a bit ambiguous with the short timeframe. \n\nGiven the confusion between primary psychosis and mood-related, the safest provisional diagnosis might be <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med> pending longer-term evaluation, with associated <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. However, the patient also has clear depressive features, so maybe the diagnosis is <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. \n\nAlternatively, the DSM-5 allows for the depressive episode with psychotic features, so that's a viable option. The key is whether the psychosis is better accounted for by another condition. Since the patient's delusions (e.g., TV messages, neighbors in a conspiracy) aren't mood-incongruent? Wait, the criteria for MDD with psychotic features allows for mood-congruent or incongruent. The voices telling them not to hurt themselves might be mood-congruent (if the content relates to their low mood), but the other delusions (TV messages, neighbors) are not necessarily mood-congruent. The DSM-5 allows for either. \n\nTherefore, the primary diagnosis could be Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. The other possibility is schizoaffective. Since the patient's symptoms have been present for two weeks, and schizoaffective requires at least two weeks, but also requires that the mood disorder occurs concurrently. Since the timeframe matches, but the differential is needed. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, in a clinical setting, the diagnosis might be provisional with both possibilities. But per the instructions, pick the most likely based on symptoms. The presence of both mood and psychosis makes schizoaffective a strong contender. \n\nWait, but the patient's depressive symptoms are prominent. The DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective requires that the mood episodes are present for a significant portion of the total duration of active and residual symptoms. But since it's only two weeks, maybe not enough time to determine if it's schizoaffective. Hence, provisional Dx: \n\nProvisional diagnosis: <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med> with comorbid <sym>depressive features</sym>, but need more evaluation. However, the instructions say to pick the best fit. Alternatively, if the primary issue is the depression with psychosis, then MDD with psychotic features. \n\nAlternatively, since the psychosis seems primary (voices, paranoia, delusions), and the depression is co-occurring, schizophrenia spectrum might be more primary. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is that the DSM-5 allows for MDD with psychotic features when the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the patient's responses one by one. The first thing I notice is that they mentioned losing interest in hobbies like gardening, which points to possible anhedonia. The mention of \"voices getting louder\" is a key red flag for hallucinations, which is a psychotic symptom. \n\nIn answer 3, the patient talks about feeling down and empty, even after stopping medication. That could indicate depression, and the fact that they quit their meds without consulting a doctor is a concern. It might affect their current symptoms.\n\nQuestion 4 asks about sleeping less but having energy. The patient paces at night due to voices, so that's insomnia but also the voices contributing to their restlessness. It's a bit conflicting because they mention exhaustion but also pacing, which could be agitation.\n\nFor question 5 about increased activity or risk-taking, they mention writing notes and thinking the TV sends messages. This could be a sign of paranoia or delusions. The uncertainty here shows some insight but also the reality testing issues.\n\nAnxiety is a big theme here. The patient feels nervous, has panic reactions to shadows and figures, and avoids places like the grocery store. The perception of people staring and the neighbor being part of a conspiracy points to paranoid ideation.\n\nThe headaches linked to voices might be psychosomatic, but the patient is questioning if it's real. That confusion between physical and psychological symptoms is important. Also, when asked about feeling illnesses aren't taken seriously, the patient feels invalidated, which can worsen symptoms.\n\nThe last question about self-harm is concerning. The patient has thoughts about disappearing but is conflicted because voices tell them not to. This ambivalence needs attention because even if they aren't acting on it, the presence of suicidal ideation is a risk factor.\n\nPutting this together, the main symptoms are psychotic features (hallucinations, paranoia), depressive symptoms, anxiety, and possible risk of self-harm. The patterns are the presence of both positive psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (anhedonia, social withdrawal). The patient's reality testing is impaired, making it hard for them to distinguish real from imagined. \n\nClinically significant areas would include psychotic disorders, major depressive disorder with possible anxiety comorbidity. The risk factors are the suicidal thoughts, stopping meds without medical advice, and the delusions which could lead to dangerous behaviors. The primary concern here is the combination of psychosis and depression, which might point towards a psychotic disorder with depressive features or a major depressive episode with psychotic features. The self-harm thoughts need immediate attention, but the patient's ambivalence might mean they're not an active danger right now. However, the voices telling them not to hurt themselves could be part of their delusions, so their judgment is compromised. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other symptoms. The avoidance of places and social withdrawal could also be part of social anxiety or paranoid delusions. The physical symptoms like headaches might be stress-related or a manifestation of their psychological distress. The key here is to note the presence of both depressive and psychotic symptoms, which could indicate a diagnosis like schizoaffective disorder. Also, the patient's lack of medication compliance is a significant concern for treatment adherence and symptom management.\n\nI should structure the summary by first listing the main symptoms and concerns, then the patterns observed, potential clinical areas (like psychosis, depression, anxiety), risk factors like self-harm thoughts and medication noncompliance, and then a concise clinical summary using appropriate terms like \"psychotic features,\" \"major depressive disorder,\" \"paranoid ideation,\" and so on. I have to be careful not to overpathologize but clearly state the observable symptoms and the risks.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary:**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Psychotic Features:** Auditory hallucinations (\"voices\"), paranoid ideation (e.g., interpreting TV signals or neighbors as threats), and perceptual disturbances (e.g., shadows moving, blinking streetlights as \"codes\").  \n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure in previously enjoyed activities like gardening), persistent sadness, hopelessness, and self-reported \"emptiness.\"  \n- **Anxiety and Panic:** Persistent nervousness, hypervigilance, panic attacks (e.g., reacting to perceived threats like shadows/figures), and avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding public spaces).  \n- **Cognitive Disturbances:** Impaired reality testing (e.g., uncertainty about whether actions/thoughts are real or imagined), diminished insight into illness (\"Are the voices imaginary?\").  \n- **Somatic Complaints:** Headaches correlated with hallucinatory intensity, interpreted as possibly psychosomatic.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Ambivalence and Uncertainty:** The patient frequently qualifies statements (e.g., \"maybe,\" \"not sure\"), highlighting impaired insight and reality testing.  \n- **Medication Noncompliance:** Discontinuation of antidepressants without clinical guidance, exacerbating depressive symptoms and possibly contributing to symptom escalation.  \n- **Externalization of Internal Conflict:** Psychotic experiences (voices) are described as both influential (e.g., preventing self-harm) and distressing, suggesting internalized paranoia.  \n- **Reality Distortion:** Blurring of real vs. perceived threats (e.g., questioning whether neighbors or shadows are harmful).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Psychotic Disorder:** Hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and impaired reality testing suggest a primary psychotic process (e.g., schizophrenia spectrum, brief psychotic disorder).  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features:** Depressive symptoms with comorbid hallucinations/delusions.  \n- **Anxiety/Panic Disorder:** Exacerbated by perceived threats linked to psychotic content.  \n- **Risk of Self-Harm:** Acknowledged suicidal ideation (\"thinking about disappearing\"), though mitigated by conflicting voice content.  \n- **Medication Adherence Issues:** Stopping prescribed antidepressants without medical consultation, risking symptom recurrence/escalation.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Explicit acknowledgment of self-harm thoughts, though modulated by external (hallucinatory) influences.  \n- **Medication Noncompliance:** Risks symptom deterioration and impaired therapeutic response.  \n- **Paranoid Agitation:** Potential for dangerous reactions to perceived threats (e.g., reacting to \"figures\" or \"codes\").  \n- **Impaired Insight:** Difficulty distinguishing reality from psychosis exacerbates functional impairment and safety risks.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with a constellation of **psychotic symptoms** (auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, perceptual disturbances) and **depressive features** (anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal), suggestive of a **psychotic disorder with comorbid major depression** or a **schizoaffective disorder**. Anxiety and panic symptoms appear secondary to persecutory ideation and hypervigilance. **Clinical priorities include:**  \n- **Acute Risk Assessment:** Evaluate suicidal ideation, hallucination content, and potential for self-harm/psychomotor agitation.  \n- **Psychosis Stabilization:** Address delusional and perceptual disturbances requiring antipsychotic intervention and/or referral to psychiatric care.  \n- **Medication Reassessment:** Re-establish medication adherence (e.g., antidepressant) and evaluate need for antipsychotics.  \n- **Safety Planning:** Mitigate risks of self-harm and agitation via crisis intervention strategies.  \n- **Collateral Information:** Assess for recent stressors or trauma, and consider family/sociocultural context contributing to symptom expression.  \n\n**Recommendations:** Immediate psychiatric evaluation for psychosis, collaborative care with a mental health team, and urgent intervention for medication management and safety.",

However, the patient's symptoms also raise consideration of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med>), particularly if the psychosis persists beyond the mood episode. The distinction requires further evaluation of symptom chronology and duration.  \n\nBut given the self-reported depression and the psychosis occurring alongside, and the time frame of two weeks, maybe the former is primary. However, the user's references mention the consideration of attenuated psychosis but in this case, it's full-blown. \n\nAlternatively, the combination of both might point to schizoaffective. The key is whether the mood episode is predominant. Schizoaffective requires that the mood disturbance is not brief relative to the disturbance. Since this is only two weeks, maybe it's too short to meet criteria, so the provisional Dx might be Major Depressive with Psychotic features, with psychotic disorder NOS as a differential.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me go step by step. \n\nThe patient's answers include clear hallucinations and delusions. The DSM-5 criteria for Schizophreniform require at least two weeks of active-phase symptoms (delusions/hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or catatonia) with significant functional impairment. The patient's symptoms meet active symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), impaired functioning (avoiding public places, social withdrawal). So Schizophreniform could fit. \n\nBut the presence of depressive symptoms (Q3 and Q7) must be considered. Schizoaffective requires the mood disorder to be concurrent with active psychotic symptoms. Since the depressive symptoms are present alongside psychosis, schizoaffective might be possible. However, the duration requirement for schizoaffective is that the mood episodes occur concurrently with delusions/hallucinations for a substantial portion, which may be the case here. \n\nThe patient's stopping meds could have exacerbated symptoms. \n\nSince the time frame is two weeks, and the criteria for schizoaffective requires at least two weeks of symptoms, but for schizoaffective specifically, the depressive episode must be present for the majority of the time. It's a bit ambiguous with the short timeframe. \n\nGiven the confusion between primary psychosis and mood-related, the safest provisional diagnosis might be <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med> pending longer-term evaluation, with associated <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. However, the patient also has clear depressive features, so maybe the diagnosis is <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. \n\nAlternatively, the DSM-5 allows for the depressive episode with psychotic features, so that's a viable option. The key is whether the psychosis is better accounted for by another condition. Since the patient's delusions (e.g., TV messages, neighbors in a conspiracy) aren't mood-incongruent? Wait, the criteria for MDD with psychotic features allows for mood-congruent or incongruent. The voices telling them not to hurt themselves might be mood-congruent (if the content relates to their low mood), but the other delusions (TV messages, neighbors) are not necessarily mood-congruent. The DSM-5 allows for either. \n\nTherefore, the primary diagnosis could be Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. The other possibility is schizoaffective. Since the patient's symptoms have been present for two weeks, and schizoaffective requires at least two weeks, but also requires that the mood disorder occurs concurrently. Since the timeframe matches, but the differential is needed. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, in a clinical setting, the diagnosis might be provisional with both possibilities. But per the instructions, pick the most likely based on symptoms. The presence of both mood and psychosis makes schizoaffective a strong contender. \n\nWait, but the patient's depressive symptoms are prominent. The DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective requires that the mood episodes are present for a significant portion of the total duration of active and residual symptoms. But since it's only two weeks, maybe not enough time to determine if it's schizoaffective. Hence, provisional Dx: \n\nProvisional diagnosis: <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med> with comorbid <sym>depressive features</sym>, but need more evaluation. However, the instructions say to pick the best fit. Alternatively, if the primary issue is the depression with psychosis, then MDD with psychotic features. \n\nAlternatively, since the psychosis seems primary (voices, paranoia, delusions), and the depression is co-occurring, schizophrenia spectrum might be more primary. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is that the DSM-5 allows for MDD with psychotic features when the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood",

      "predicted": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a detailed case with the patient's responses and clinical notes. I need to structure the response according to their strict format. \n\nFirst, the compassionate summary: I should acknowledge the patient's struggles with empathy, highlighting their reported symptoms without jargon. Use the tags for quotes and symptoms where appropriate.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section. The main symptoms are psychosis (voices, paranoia), depression, and anxiety. The key here is deciding between major depressive disorder with psychotic features or a psychotic disorder. The hallucinations and delusions are prominent, so maybe a psychotic disorder. But the depressive symptoms are also significant. Schizoaffective disorder? Let me check DSM-5 criteria. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 specifies that for schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic symptoms must persist when mood symptoms are in remission. Since the patient has both, but the history isn't fully clear, maybe provisional. Alternatively, psychotic disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) or brief psychotic episode? Also, the Somatic Symptom Disorder was mentioned in the references, but the patient's symptoms are more about psychosis and depression, so SSD might not fit here. The patient's stopping meds abruptly is a concern. \n\nThe user emphasized not to use SSD unless clear, so probably not here. The primary diagnosis would be something like \"Schizophreniform Disorder\" or \"Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features.\" But the depression is chronic and the psychosis is prominent. Alternatively, maybe a psychotic disorder with depressive features. Need to see which criteria fit better.\n\nLooking at the answers, the patient has been experiencing these symptoms for a while? The time frame is two weeks. The duration for schizophrenia requires at least a month, but schizophreniform is if it's longer than a month but less than six months. Since the timeframe here is two weeks, maybe a provisional diagnosis of \"Brief Psychotic Disorder\" if there's a stressor, but the patient didn't mention a recent stressor. Alternatively, if the symptoms are part of a major depressive episode with psychotic features, that's possible. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features requires the presence of depressive symptoms plus hallucinations/delusions. The patient's quotes about voices and paranoia align. But the paranoia might be more delusional. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria for that. \n\nAlternatively, if the psychotic symptoms are not entirely accounted for by another mental disorder, then Schizophreniform or Schizoaffective. Since the depressive symptoms are present, but the psychosis isn't entirely secondary to mood, maybe a primary psychotic disorder with comorbid depression. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the mood disorder and psychosis are overlapping. The patient reports stopping antidepressants, which might have worsened symptoms. \n\nWait, the user's additional reference mentioned \"attenuated psychosis syndrome\" as a potential risk for developing psychosis. But the patient is already experiencing clear hallucinations and delusions, so it's beyond attenuated. \n\nPutting this together, the most fitting might be **Schizophreniform Disorder** given the presence of hallucinations and delusions with significant impairment, but given the depressive symptoms, maybe **Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type** (though the depressive features here might align more with the depressive type). Wait, but schizoaffective requires a period of mood symptoms without psychotic features, which isn't clear here. This is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, **Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)** if criteria aren't fully met. But given the severity of symptoms, perhaps **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**. The DSM-5 does include that as a specifier. Let me confirm: \n\nMajor Depressive Disorder with psychotic features (like delusions or hallucinations) would be the diagnosis if the depression and psychosis are concurrent and the psychosis occurs exclusively during mood episodes. The patient's description of voices and paranoia coinciding with mood symptoms might fit here. \n\nHowever, the paranoid thoughts (e.g., neighbor being part of a conspiracy, TV messages) might be delusions, which are more characteristic of schizophrenia. The presence of both mood and psychotic symptoms complicates it. \n\nThe patient's mention of stopping medication abruptly could exacerbate symptoms. Given the timeframe of two weeks, maybe they're experiencing an acute episode. \n\nThe user's references mention attenuated psychosis syndrome, but since symptoms are overt, it's beyond that. \n\nPutting it together, the primary diagnosis would be **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**. Alternatively, if the psychosis is primary, Schizophreniform Disorder. \n\nWait, but the DSM-5 allows for a depressive episode with psychotic features. Let me check the criteria again. The DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Episode with Psychotic Features requires the presence of delusions, hallucinations, or other psychotic symptoms (excluding mood-congruent delusions). The patient's voices are congruent (e.g., voices telling them not to hurt themselves), but the paranoid delusions (neighbors, TV messages) are non-mood congruent. So that would fit. \n\nTherefore, the diagnosis would be: \n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>, with associated <sym>paranoid delusions</sym> and <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>. However, the patient's symptoms also raise consideration of a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., <med>Schizophreniform Disorder</med>), particularly if the psychosis persists beyond the mood episode.
