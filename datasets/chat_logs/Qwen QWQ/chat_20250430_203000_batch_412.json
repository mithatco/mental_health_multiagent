      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's break down this patient's responses. The user provided a detailed set of answers to a 20-question survey, and the instructions require a structured response based on DSM-5 criteria. The user emphasized the need to avoid raw reference text, so I should focus on the provided answers and the DSM-5 info given earlier.\n\nStarting with the compassionate summary: I need to acknowledge the patient's struggles with social interactions and anxiety without being too clinical. Highlight their efforts to cope and the impact on their life.\n\nNext, the diagnosis. The strongest indicators point to Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). The patient's avoidance of social situations, panic attacks, and the repetitive negative thoughts about social judgment are textbook for SAD. The panic attacks (Q7-8) and somatic symptoms (Q10) align with DSM-5 criteria for SAD with panic features. There's also mention of depersonalization during events (Q18), which sometimes occurs in severe anxiety. The lack of suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms (Q11-13) rules out other issues.\n\nIn the reasoning section, I need to tie each symptom to the diagnosis. The avoidance (Q8-9), physiological reactions (Q7, Q10), and cognitive symptoms (Q16-17) all support SAD. The question about GAD (Q3-4) is there, but the context-specific nature leans toward SAD rather than GAD. The panic attacks are part of the anxiety spectrum but not severe enough for a separate panic disorder diagnosis unless criteria are met.\n\nFor treatment steps: CBT is first-line for SAD. SSRIs could be considered if therapy isn't sufficient. Panic-focused interventions might be needed given the panic episodes. Addressing the depersonalization (dissociation during stress) could be part of CBT. Monitoring for depression is important, but the patient's answers don't strongly indicate a depressive disorder yet. The patient's mention of avoidance affecting work/school (implied in Q8-9) suggests functional impairment, so the treatment steps should address that.\n\nNeed to ensure that all required sections are in order, using the correct tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. Also, make sure not to mention anything outside the provided data. Avoid somatic symptom disorder since the physical symptoms are tied directly to social anxiety, not medically unexplained. Focus on the key points from the answers given, ensuring the tags are properly placed. Check for any sign of trauma, but the data doesn't suggest PTSD. The depersonalization is part of anxiety response. \n\nMake sure the diagnosis is the first line under the **Diagnosis:** heading without any extra text. The reasoning clearly connects the symptoms to SAD. The recommendations are practical and evidence-based. Formatting is crucial here to meet the user's structure exactly. No markdown, just plain text with the specified tags and section headers.\n</think>\n\nYour responses highlight a profound struggle with social interactions, where everyday tasks like attending meetings or gatherings feel overwhelming due to fear of judgment. The descriptions of panic attacks, physical symptoms like racing heart or shortness of breath (<sym>dyspnea</sym>), and the <sym>detachment</sym> during social events (<quote>\"feeling like I'm watching myself in a movie\"</quote>) suggest significant distress tied to interpersonal situations. Your efforts to cope by withdrawing (<sym>avoidance</sym>) are understandable, and I want you to know that these experiences are valid and treatable.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with panic features, possibly comorbid with subthreshold Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> is the primary diagnosis, with clear <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym>, <sym>physiological arousal</sym> (e.g., panic attacks, tachycardia), and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> (Q2, Q7\u2013Q9) impairing social and occupational functioning. The <sym>depersonalization</sym> during anxiety (Q18) aligns with severe cases of SAD.  \n- <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is a secondary consideration due to <sym>excessive worry</sym> about social performance (Q16\u2013Q17), but symptoms are context-specific, favoring SAD.  \n- Panic attacks (<sym>recurrent dyspnea, hypervigilance</sym>) meet panic features specifier for SAD (DSM-5).  \n- No evidence of psychosis (<med>somatic symptom disorder</med> is excluded due to context-bound symptoms).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety through exposure-based exercises and cognitive restructuring to address irrational beliefs about others' judgments (e.g., \"They\u2019ll laugh at me\").  \n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>\u03b2-blockers</med> for performance-related anxiety if CBT alone is insufficient.  \n3. **Panic Management Training:** Teach grounding techniques for acute panic (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing during social events).  \n4. **Gradual Exposure Exercises:** Start with low-stakes social interactions (e.g., short conversations) to build tolerance.  \n5. **Monitor for Depressive Symptoms:** Though <sym>anhedonia</sym> is context-limited, continue to assess mood changes.  \n6. **Psychological Assessment for Comorbidity:** Rule out <med>social (pragmatic) communication disorder</med> if communication difficulties persist beyond anxiety.  \n\nLet me know how we can tailor these steps to your comfort level\u2014we can move at a pace that feels safe for you.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the patient's responses to the DSM-5 questionnaire. Let me start by reading through each question and answer carefully.\n\nLooking at question 2 about little interest or pleasure, the patient says they can enjoy things alone but not in groups. That points to social anxiety affecting their ability to enjoy activities when others are involved. \n\nFor question 3 about feeling down or depressed, the patient mentions feeling drained after social interactions, but not hopeless. So maybe some depressive symptoms triggered by social situations, but not chronic. \n\nThe answers to questions 7 and 8 about anxiety and avoidance are strong indicators. The patient experiences panic symptoms, like trouble breathing, and actively avoids social situations. That's classic for social anxiety disorder. \n\nQuestion 10 mentions physical symptoms like a tight chest and shaky voice in social settings. These are somatic symptoms tied to anxiety. \n\nThe responses to questions 16 and 17 about repetitive thoughts and self-doubt loops suggest obsessive thoughts related to social performance, possibly obsessive-compulsive features, but they don't mention compulsions. \n\nQuestion 18 talks about feeling detached, which could be derealization or depersonalization, often seen in anxiety disorders when stress is high. \n\nThey also mention avoiding risks and starting projects, which might be avoidance behaviors contributing to social isolation. No suicidal thoughts, which is good, but the anxiety is significant. \n\nThe patient's pattern shows that most symptoms are context-specific to social interactions, leading me to think of social anxiety disorder. There's also some overlap with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) because of the constant worry, but the social focus is key here. \n\nI need to note the avoidance behaviors and the physical symptoms as clinical markers. The repetitive negative thoughts might be part of an anxiety response rather than OCD since there's no mention of compulsions. The derealization episodes during social events are important too. \n\nPotential diagnoses to consider: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), possibly with GAD elements. No psychotic symptoms, so that's ruled out. The main concerns are the impact on social functioning and the physical symptoms during anxiety episodes. \n\nRisk factors include the impact on daily activities like avoiding meetings and events, leading to isolation. The panic attacks mentioned in Q8 are a red flag. \n\nI should structure the summary to list symptoms, patterns like context-specific issues, clinical areas of concern like SAD and GAD, and the panic and avoidance as risk factors. Make sure to use clinical terms accurately without overstepping into diagnosis without more info. Avoid mentioning things not in the responses, like OCD unless it's clear. \n\nDouble-check that all points are backed by the patient's answers. The detachment and somatic symptoms are key. The summary needs to be concise, using terms like \"context-specific anhedonia,\" \"recurrent panic attacks,\" \"avoidant behaviors,\" etc.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety-Related Symptoms:** Marked avoidance of social interactions (Q2, Q8, Q9), fear of negative evaluation (Q2), and physiological arousal (e.g., tachycardia, dyspnea during social situations [Q7, Q8]).  \n- **Recurrent Panic Symptoms:** Panic attacks (e.g., dyspnea and premature exit from social events [Q8]).  \n- **Anhedonia in Social Contexts:** Diminished pleasure in group activities despite solitary enjoyment (Q2).  \n- **Autonomic Hyperarousal:** Sleep disturbances linked to rumination (Q15), somatic symptoms (chest tightness, shaky voice in social settings [Q10]).  \n- **Cognitive Distortions:** Intrusive, self-judgmental thoughts (Q16\u2013Q17) and hypervigilance toward perceived social rejection.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Context-Specific Symptoms:** All symptoms cluster around social/performance situations, with minimal distress in solitude.  \n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** Systematic withdrawal from social obligations (e.g., skipping meetings, declining invitations [Q8\u2013Q9]).  \n- **Psychophysiological Reactivity:** Acute autonomic arousal (e.g., panic attacks [Q7\u2013Q8]) and dissociative detachment (feeling detached or \u201cwatching oneself\u201d in social settings [Q18]).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Most consistent with DSM-5 criteria, including fear of scrutiny, avoidance, and functional impairment.  \n- **Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia (Possibility):** Recurrent panic attacks in social contexts and avoidance of feared situations (requires further assessment).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Chronic worry about social performance (Q7, Q17), though context specificity leans more toward SAD.  \n- **Possible Subthreshold Depressive Features:** Mild dysphoria post-social interactions (Q3), but no suicidal ideation (Q11) or pervasive hopelessness.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social/Interpersonal Impairment:** Avoidance of obligations (e.g., work meetings) and reduced social support.  \n- **Functional Impact:** Disruption of daily activities (work/school) due to anxiety.  \n- **Dissociative Experiences:** Detachment during anxiety (Q18), suggesting high arousal or emotional overwhelm.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient exhibits prominent **social anxiety symptoms**, including anticipatory anxiety, avoidance of social interactions, and context-specific panic attacks. Physical symptoms (tachycardia, dyspnea) and somatic complaints (chest tightness) align with acute anxiety responses. Cognitive features include self-focused attention, negative self-appraisal, and intrusive thoughts (Q16\u2013Q17). Avoidance behaviors (Q8\u2013Q9) and functional impairment suggest moderate-to-severe social anxiety disorder. Dissociative detachment (depersonalization) during stress (Q18) may indicate heightened arousal. No psychotic features (Q12\u2013Q13). No suicidal ideation (Q11), though avoidance of social participation may increase isolation risks. Further evaluation of panic disorder and GAD is warranted, but social anxiety appears central.  \n\n**Clinical Prioritization:** Rule out Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia; SAD is the leading differential. Consider comorbid GAD if baseline anxiety extends beyond social contexts. Assess functional impact on occupational/social roles.",

The descriptions of panic attacks, physical symptoms like racing heart or shortness of breath (<sym>dyspnea</sym>), and the <sym>detachment</sym> during social events (<quote>\"feeling like I'm watching myself in a movie\"</quote>) suggest significant distress tied to interpersonal situations. Your efforts to cope by withdrawing (<sym>avoidance</sym>) are understandable, and I want you to know that these experiences are valid and treatable.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) with panic features, possibly comorbid with subthreshold Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> is the primary diagnosis, with clear <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym>, <sym>physiological arousal</sym> (e.g., panic attacks, tachycardia), and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> (Q2, Q7\u2013Q9) impairing social and occupational functioning. The <sym>depersonalization</sym> during anxiety (Q18) aligns with severe cases of SAD.  \n- <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is a secondary consideration due to <sym>excessive worry</sym> about social performance (Q16\u2013Q17), but symptoms are context-specific, favoring SAD.  \n- Panic attacks (<sym>recurrent dyspnea, hypervigilance</sym>) meet panic features specifier for SAD (DSM-5).  \n- No evidence of psychosis (<med>somatic symptom disorder</med> is excluded due to context-bound symptoms).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety through exposure-based exercises and cognitive restructuring to address irrational beliefs about others' judgments (e.g., \"They\u2019ll laugh at me\").  \n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., sertraline) or <med>\u03b2-blockers</med> for performance-related anxiety if CBT alone is insufficient.  \n3. **Panic Management Training:** Teach grounding techniques for acute panic (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing during social events).  \n4. **Gradual Exposure Exercises:** Start with low-stakes social interactions (e.g., short conversations) to build tolerance.  \n5. **Monitor for Depressive Symptoms:** Though <sym>anhedonia</sym> is context-limited, continue to assess mood changes.  \n6. **Psychological Assessment for Comorbidity:** Rule out <med>social (pragmatic) communication disorder</med> if communication difficulties persist beyond anxiety.  \n\nLet me know how we can tailor these steps to your comfort level\u2014we can move at a pace that feels safe for you.",
