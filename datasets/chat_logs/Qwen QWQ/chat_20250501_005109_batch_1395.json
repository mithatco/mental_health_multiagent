      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the user's responses. The patient is clearly struggling with social situations, avoiding them to the point of turning down promotions. They mention panic attacks before events, which aligns with social anxiety. But I need to make sure I'm not missing other possibilities. They don't report depression, but their avoidance is severe. The somatic symptoms like stomach aches and shaking are common in anxiety disorders, but the DSM-5 criteria for somatic symptom disorder require excessive thoughts or behaviors about symptoms, which I don't see here. The main issue is the fear of social embarrassment and avoidance, which points more to social anxiety disorder. The panic attacks are situational, so panic disorder could be a comorbidity. I should make sure to note that. Also, they feel their issues are dismissed, which is a social/interpersonal concern. Need to check if there's any depression, but the patient didn't report feeling down or hopeless beyond the social context. The diagnosis seems clear: social anxiety disorder with possible GAD and panic disorder features. Next steps would focus on CBT and possibly medication if needed. Make sure to structure the response exactly as specified, with all the required tags and sections. Avoid mentioning somatic symptom disorder unless it fits, which it doesn't here because the excessive thoughts about illness aren't present. Stick to the provided answers.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> like stomachaches and trembling, persistent avoidance of social interactions, and intense <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> paint a picture of profound distress shaped by fear of judgment and isolation.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a patient's responses to a DSM-5 questionnaire and wants an analysis. First, I need to go through each of the patient's answers and note the key points.\n\nStarting with Q1: The patient is nervous but willing to be honest. That's a good sign, but their anxiety is already showing here. \n\nQ2 talks about little interest in things but the patient clarifies it's more about avoiding social situations to prevent embarrassment. That's a classic sign of social anxiety. They're not exactly saying they lack interest, but their avoidance is key here.\n\nQ3: They mention feeling anxious instead of depressed. The \"weight\" when thinking about going out points to anticipatory anxiety. They don't want to seem melodramatic, which might indicate they downplay their symptoms.\n\nQ4: Sleep issues but not the typical insomnia with energy; instead, they have trouble sleeping due to racing thoughts about social events. Caffeine use might be a coping mechanism.\n\nQ5: No increase in projects or risky behavior. Avoidance again here, even of small talk. They can't handle big projects, which suggests significant impairment.\n\nQ6: High anxiety symptoms\u2014shaking, overthinking, fear of being watched. They're questioning if others feel that way, which might indicate social isolation.\n\nQ7: Panic attacks before events, but better when alone. This shows situational panic disorders.\n\nQ8: Avoidance of social situations to the point of turning down promotions and social gatherings. Avoidance is a major coping strategy here.\n\nQ9: Physical symptoms like stomach aches and chest tightness in social situations. These are somatic symptoms linked to anxiety.\n\nQ10: Feeling their issues aren't taken seriously. They downplay it as shyness, which might lead to under-treatment. Social support is lacking.\n\nQ11: No suicidal ideation, which is a relief, but the desire to disappear shows intense distress. They differentiate their feelings from self-harm, which is important.\n\nNow, compiling the main symptoms: Social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, somatic symptoms. Patterns include avoidance as a coping mechanism, physical manifestations, and downplaying symptoms. Clinical significance would be social anxiety disorder, possible GAD, and panic disorder. Risk factors include lack of support and possible impact on career (turned down promotions). They haven't mentioned suicidal intent, which is a positive, but the somatic symptoms and avoidance need attention. Also, their perception that others don't take their issues seriously could affect treatment adherence.\n\nNeed to structure this into the required points: main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risk factors, and summary. Use clinical terms like \"social avoidance behaviors,\" \"anticipatory anxiety,\" \"somatic symptoms,\" \"under-recognition of symptoms,\" and \"functional impairment.\" Make sure not to speculate\u2014just present the facts from their answers.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social Anxiety/Phobia**: Persistent avoidance of social situations due to fear of embarrassment, including declining promotions, social gatherings, and academic events (Q2, Q8, Q9).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety**: Excessive worry (e.g., racing thoughts about social interactions leading to insomnia) (Q4, Q6).  \n- **Panic Symptoms**: Panic attacks (e.g., heart palpitations, gastrointestinal distress, and anticipatory anxiety prior to social events) (Q7, Q9).  \n- **Somatic Symptoms**: Physical manifestations of anxiety (e.g., tremors, chest tightness, gastrointestinal distress) linked to social scenarios (Q6, Q9, Q10).  \n- **Perceived Stigma**: Reports of under-recognition of symptoms by others (e.g., dismissed as \"shy\") (Q11).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Avoidance as Primary Coping Strategy**: Systematic withdrawal from social/performative situations to mitigate anxiety (Q2, Q8, Q9).  \n- **Anticipatory Anxiety**: Symptoms escalate in response to anticipated social interactions (Q3, Q6, Q7).  \n- **Minimization of Distress**: Qualifiers such as \"maybe,\" \"I don\u2019t want to sound melodramatic,\" and \"I guess so\" suggest underreporting severity (Q1, Q3, Q11).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder**: Meets criteria via persistent fear of social scrutiny and avoidance causing functional impairment (e.g., career/educational impact).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Excessive anxiety and somatic symptoms (Q4, Q6, Q9).  \n- **Panic Disorder with Social Triggers**: Panic attacks explicitly tied to social/performance contexts (Q7, Q9).  \n- **Poor Social Support**: Reports of dismissive responses from others (Q11), potentially exacerbating distress.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Avoidance of career advancement and social obligations (Q8, Q9).  \n- **Physical Comorbidities**: Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular somatic symptoms during anxiety escalation (Q9, Q10.  \n- **Stigma Concerns**: Fear of being judged as \"overdramatic\" may contribute to delayed help-seeking or underdisclosure (Q3, Q11.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary**  \nThe patient presents with clinically significant symptoms of **social anxiety disorder**, accompanied by features of generalized anxiety and panic disorder, with clear functional impairment in occupational, academic, and social domains. Key symptoms include anticipatory anxiety, avoidance of social/performance situations, and somatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal distress, tremors, and panic attacks). The patient\u2019s pattern of minimizing distress (e.g., attributing symptoms to shyness, fear of stigma) suggests potential underrecognition of severity by others and possible barriers to seeking support. No acute self-harm ideation is reported, but chronic impairment and somatic complaints warrant targeted evaluation. Further assessment should prioritize validation of symptom severity, exploration of social/ occupational impairment, and evaluation for comorbid mood or anxiety disorders.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains, but missed or superficially covered a few areas. Specifically, the therapist thoroughly explored depression (questions 1-2), anxiety (questions 6-8), and somatic symptoms (questions 9-10). However, domains like mania (questions 4-5), psychotic symptoms (questions 12-13), and substance use (questions 21-23) were not directly addressed or probed deeply. The therapist also didn't explicitly inquire about repetitive thoughts/behaviors (question 16-17), dissociation (question 18), or identity and relationships (questions 19-20), which could provide further insight into the patient's condition.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were slight inaccuracies or vague phrasing in some instances. For example, when asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the patient described avoiding social activities due to fear of embarrassment rather than lack of interest. The therapist could have probed further into the nature of their 'interest' and 'pleasure' to better understand the patient's experience. Additionally, questions about sleep (question 14) and cognitive function (question 15) were not directly addressed, which could have provided more comprehensive understanding.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flows logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies and abrupt transitions. For instance, after discussing panic attacks, the therapist moved to questions about somatic symptoms without fully exploring the patient's experience of panic. The conversation could benefit from smoother transitions and more follow-up questions on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's desire to 'disappear' during anxious moments.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder clearly align with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as worry about humiliation, avoidance of social situations, and somatic symptoms. The reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was well-stated and clinically sound, including consideration of differential diagnoses like Somatic Symptom Disorder, which was ruled out due to the absence of disproportionate preoccupation with physical symptoms outside of social anxiety.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and provided a supportive environment for disclosure. For example, when the patient described wanting to 'disappear,' the therapist responded with understanding and emphasized that their experience was valid and treatable. The interaction was warm, personalized, and free of clinical detachment or overly technical language."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a strong clinical understanding and empathetic approach. While most DSM-5 dimensions were addressed, a few areas like mania, psychosis, and substance use were not thoroughly explored. The conversation could benefit from more comprehensive coverage of all domains and smoother logical transitions. However, the diagnostic justification and empathy shown were exceptional.",

Your descriptions of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance of promotions</sym> highlight how this struggle is limiting your life in meaningful ways. The way you described wanting to \u201cdisappear\u201d reflects deep emotional pain, and I want you to know that what you\u2019re experiencing is valid and treatable.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (with <med>Panic Disorder</med> features and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> comorbidity)  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe constellation of symptoms strongly aligns with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>: <sym>worry about humiliation</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social/performance situations</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms (e.g., racing heart, gastrointestinal distress)</sym> in anticipation of social interactions.
