      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a full conversation between a mental health professional and a patient based on the provided DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. The patient has schizophrenia with specific symptoms listed. The user wants all 23 questions from the questionnaire to be asked in order, each with a natural patient response in conversational language, not numerical ratings. The JSON array must include all questions and responses.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the introduction from the assistant. They must introduce themselves, mention the specific questionnaire by its full name, explain the purpose, reassure confidentiality, and outline the process. Then, the patient responds appropriately. \n\nThen, for each of the 23 questions, the assistant asks exactly as per the questionnaire. The patient's answers need to naturally reflect their schizophrenia symptoms, showing the listed characteristics like hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, negative symptoms, etc. The patient should sometimes be hesitant, tangential, or distracted, and mention real-world effects of their symptoms. They should avoid using numbers but describe severity through their experiences. \n\nI need to ensure that all 23 questions are covered. Let me check each section:\n\nI. Mood (Q1-2): The patient should report lack of interest and feeling down due to depression from schizophrenia's negative symptoms.\n\nII. Anger (Q3): The patient might mention irritability due to hallucinations or paranoia, but perhaps downplay it.\n\nIII. Energy/Activity (Q4-5): The patient might say they have low energy, but since question 4 asks about mania symptoms (sleeping less but high energy), maybe they answer they don't have that. For Q5, perhaps they\u2019re not starting projects, so 0 or 1?\n\nIV. Anxiety (Q6-8): They might feel anxious due to delusions, but the patient might not admit it directly. For avoidance, maybe they avoid places they think are dangerous.\n\nV. Somatic (Q9-10): They have unexplained aches, but might think it's due to their condition, or maybe not. Question 10 about feeling not taken seriously might be a yes, as they might feel misunderstood.\n\nVI. Suicidality (Q11): The patient's current status says they're concerned but not sure if they have suicidal thoughts. Maybe a slight or mild response, but the question asks about thoughts of hurting themselves, so perhaps a 2 or 3, but in natural terms like \"sometimes think about it.\"\n\nVII. Psychosis (Q12-13): Directly related to their hallucinations and delusions. They might be hesitant but eventually confirm hearing voices (Q12) and paranoia (maybe related to thought broadcasting in Q13).\n\nVIII. Sleep (Q14): Disrupted sleep patterns, so moderate or severe.\n\nIX. Memory (Q15): Trouble concentrating and memory issues.\n\nX. Repetitive thoughts (Q16-17): Maybe not relevant, but could mention intrusive thoughts from paranoia, but perhaps the patient isn't doing repetitive behaviors, so lower.\n\nXI. Dissociation (Q18): They might feel detached, as per their symptoms.\n\nXII. Identity (Q19-20): Confusion about self and relationships.\n\nXIII. Substance (Q21-23): Depending on their history. The patient's profile says they're not using substances currently, so maybe 0 on all unless there's a mention of substance use in their profile. Wait, their medical history doesn't mention substance use, so probably 0 or 1 except maybe if they tried something, but the profile doesn't say so. So likely 0 for all substance use questions.\n\nNow I need to map each question to a patient response that aligns with their symptoms while following the instructions: natural language, not numbers, and showing their traits like tangential speech, hesitations, or confusion.\n\nAlso, the patient should occasionally seem distracted, like pausing, glancing around, etc., but since the responses are text, the content can hint at that through their wording (e.g., \"Wait, what did you ask again?\" or mentions of hearing voices).\n\nLet me go through each question step by step, ensuring all are covered. Need to make sure the patient's answers reflect the severity according to the questionnaire's scale, but in their own words. For example, for Q12 (hearing voices), the patient would answer affirmatively, perhaps hesitantly. For Q13 about thought broadcasting, maybe they mention believing others hear their thoughts.\n\nThe assistant's questions are exactly as per the questionnaire, one at a time. The patient's responses must be natural and in line with their profile.\n\nNeed to ensure that all 23 questions are present in the JSON array, each with assistant's question and patient's answer. The JSON must be correctly formatted with proper commas and brackets. No markdown, just raw JSON. Also, the assistant's first message must have the introduction, then each subsequent pair is Q&A.\n\nLet me structure each entry step by step, making sure none are missed. Need to check that the patient's responses sometimes show tangentiality, hesitations, or confusion, as per the profile. For example, when asked about hearing voices (Q12), patient might say \"sometimes, yeah, like voices... but I don't always tell people that...\"\n\nAlso, the patient's answers should reflect the severity. For example, for Q12 (hearing voices), the scale for psychosis is a 4 (severe), so the patient's answer should indicate that they experience this nearly every day.\n\nWait, but the patient's profile says they \"sometimes\" have hallucinations. The severity for psychosis domain requires a \"slight\" (1) or higher to prompt further eval. Since the patient actually has severe symptoms, their answers should reflect that, but in their own words.\n\nWait, the instructions say the patient should answer as someone experiencing the symptoms, but the DSM-5's scoring is in the background. But the patient's responses need to be in natural language. So for Q12 (hearing voices), the patient might say \"Yeah, like... sometimes I hear voices. They talk about me even when I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s been happening a lot lately.\" Which would equate to a 4 (severe). Similarly, for Q13 (thought broadcasting), \"I sometimes think others can hear my thoughts. Like, if I think about something, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just me or if they\u2019re listening. It\u2019s scary sometimes.\"\n\nAlso, the patient might sometimes seem hesitant. For example, when asked about substance use (Q21-23), they might respond negatively.\n\nNeed to make sure the patient's answers sometimes show tangential responses. Like, when asked about energy level (Q4), which is part of mania), the patient might say \"Sometimes I can\u2019t sleep, but I\u2019m not really doing more. It\u2019s hard to get out of bed, really.\"\n\nAlso, for suicidal ideation (Q11), the patient's current status says they're concerned but the profile doesn't mention active suicidal intent, so maybe a slight or mild response: \"I\u2019ve thought about... well, maybe life\u2019s just too hard sometimes. Not sure.\"\n\nI need to ensure all 23 questions are present, in order, with the patient's answers naturally reflecting their symptoms without using numbers. Each pair must be in the JSON array. Now, structure each question as an assistant's \"content\" and the patient's response accordingly.\n\nLet me start drafting each entry:\n\nFirst, the introduction by the assistant. Then the patient acknowledges. Then each question in order, with the patient's answers. Need to ensure that ALL 23 questions are there. Let me list them:\n\n1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?\n2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?\n3. Feeling more irritable...\n4. Sleeping less... (mania item, so patient might say no)\n5. Starting lots of projects... (no, they might not)\n6. Feeling nervous...\n7. Panic...\n8. Avoiding situations...\n9. Unexplained aches?\n10. Feeling not taken seriously? (maybe yes, since they have paranoid thoughts)\n11. Suicidal thoughts? (slight)\n12. Hearing voices (yes)\n13. Thoughts being broadcast (yes)\n14. Sleep problems (yes)\n15. Memory issues (yes)\n16. Unpleasant thoughts (maybe intrusive thoughts from paranoia)\n17. Repetitive behaviors (maybe not, but could mention checking\u95e8\u7a97 because of paranoia)\nWait, the questions for X (Q16-17) are about OCD-like symptoms, but the patient's profile mentions repetitive thoughts from paranoia. So maybe the patient says \"sometimes thoughts keep coming, like 'they're watching me' over and over.\"\n\n18. Dissociation (feeling detached, so yes)\n19. Unclear about self (yes)\n20. Not close to others (yes)\n21-23 substance use (no, except maybe Q23 if they used any meds nonprescription? The profile says they are inconsistent but not using substances, so 0s.\n\nI need to write patient responses that match the questionnaire's intent but in natural speech. For instance, for Q12 (hearing voices), the patient might say something like \"Yeah, sometimes I hear voices, but I don't like to talk about it much.\" \n\nNow, construct each of the 23 Q&A pairs. Ensure the patient's answers sometimes show hesitations, tangents, or confusion. Maybe in some answers they trail off or mention unrelated thoughts.\n\nAlso, the assistant must ask exactly the question's wording. The patient's answers must not mention numbers but describe the frequency/severity through their experience. \n\nNeed to check that"

      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's request. They want a structured clinical assessment based on a patient's incomplete responses to a DSM-5 questionnaire. The user provided a scenario where the patient didn't answer any of the 23 questions. The task is to create a professional response following a specific format with empathy, proper tags, and exact section headings.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure each section is addressed in order. The first paragraph should summarize the situation with empathy. The headings \"Diagnosis:\", \"Reasoning:\", and \"Recommended Next Steps\" must be present with the right formatting. Also, all medical terms and symptoms must be tagged appropriately.\n\nThe patient didn't answer any questions, so the diagnosis has to account for that lack of data. Possible diagnoses could include Schizophrenia, but the user mentioned they want it based on the given info. Since the patient was described as having schizophrenia in the initial context (from the previous query), though not in this one), but the current input doesn't mention it. Wait, looking back at the user's input, the actual provided data here has no responses, so maybe the previous context isn't part of this. Wait, the user's current input is the \"Questionnaire responses\" where all are \"No response provided\".\n\nHmm, the user's instruction says to base it solely on the presented information. Since there are no responses, the diagnosis can't be definitive. The diagnosis section must reflect uncertainty but note possible conditions based on possible issues like psychosis or cognitive issues. But the user might expect schizophrenia given the prior mention in the reference, but the current input doesn't state that. Wait, the user's last input shows the patient's responses all as \"No response provided\", so the diagnosis here must be based solely on that.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial user's example included a patient with schizophrenia, but in the current scenario, the user provided a different case where all answers are blank. So the diagnosis here isn't schizophrenia, but maybe something like \"provisional diagnosis pending further evaluation\" or \"non-response syndrome\".\n\nWait, the user's current input is a new scenario where all answers are missing. The instructions say to base the diagnosis solely on the provided information, which is the lack of responses. The user's example in the history had schizophrenia, but here, it's a different case. So I need to work with the current info.\n\nThe key points are the total non-response. Possible reasons could be a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, where the patient might not engage due to delusions or disorganization), or a cognitive impairment (e.g., severe depression, dementia, trauma-related dissociation, or substance-induced psychomotor retardation). Alternatively, the patient might be refusing to engage for other reasons like distrust.\n\nThe diagnosis section needs to reflect that, so perhaps \"Provisional diagnosis pending further evaluation\" or \"Diagnosis: Non-response to structured assessment (pending clinical interview). However, possible underlying conditions to consider include <med>schizophrenia</med>, <med>major depressive disorder</med>, or <med>cognitive impairment</med>.  \n\nIn the Reasoning section, I need to explain that the lack of response makes it impossible to confirm a diagnosis, but the pattern of non-engagement suggests possible causes like psychosis (e.g., delusions of being observed leading to refusal), severe depression/catatonia, or neurocognitive issues affecting comprehension.  \n\nRecommended steps would include a clinical interview, collateral info from others, mental status exam, and possibly assessment for cognitive or thought disorders. Ensuring to use the tags correctly.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to include all four sections exactly. The first paragraph must be a compassionate summary of what the patient conveyed. But the patient didn't provide any info. How to phrase that? Maybe express empathy for their difficulty engaging.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst paragraph: \"I'm deeply concerned about your struggle to engage with this questionnaire. It seems incredibly challenging to process these questions right now. It might feel overwhelming, and I want you to know I\u2019m here to listen in whatever way feels safe for you.\"\n\nDiagnosis section: The diagnosis line needs to reflect uncertainty. Maybe \"Diagnosis: Provisional pending further evaluation. Possible underlying conditions include <med>psychotic disorder</med> with impaired insight, <med>severe depression</med> with anhedonia, or <med>cognitive impairment</med> impacting comprehension.\"\n\nReasoning: The absence of responses could indicate a thought disorder (e.g., <med>schizophrenia</med> with delusions of surveillance or paranoia about the assessment), leading to avoidance. Alternatively, severe <sym>anhedonia</sym> or <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> from major depression. Cognitive impairment (e.g., <med>neurocognitive disorder</med>) could also hinder engagement.\n\nNext steps: 1. Structured clinical interview. 2. Collateral info from family. 3. Mental status exam. 4. Psychosocial assessment. 5. Physical work-up for neuro or metabolic causes.\n\nWait, need to ensure all sections are present and tags are used correctly. Also, check for empathy and proper tagging. Now, structure it step by step.\n</think>\n\n<sym>**Compassionate Summary:**</sym>  \nI\u2019m deeply concerned about the significant barriers you\u2019re facing in engaging with this assessment. It seems like there may be challenges with self-reporting, whether due to distress, confusion, or resistance to disclosure. Your struggle to answer these questions highlights the need for a more individualized approach to understand what you\u2019re experiencing. I want you to know this isn\u2019t a judgment of your situation\u2014my priority is to support you in clarifying your needs and risks.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional pending further evaluation. Non-response pattern suggestive of possible <med>psychotic disorder</med> (e.g., <med>schizophrenia</med> with impaired insight), <med>mood disorder with psychotic features</med>, or <med>cognitive impairment</med>).  \n\n**Reasoning:** The absence of responses across all items raises clinical concerns:  \n- **Non-response could reflect:**  \n  - <med>Psychosis</med> (e.g., delusions of being monitored, paranoia about the assessment, or inability to abstractly self-reflect due to disorganized thinking).  \n  - <med>Cognitive impairment</med> (e.g., <sym>difficulty comprehending questions</sym>, <sym>memory deficits</sym>, or <sym>attentional disruption</sym>.  \n  - <med>Depression/major depressive disorder</med> with <sym>anhedonia</sym> or <sym>apathy</sym>.  \n  - <med>Developmental disorder</med> (e.g., <med>autism spectrum disorder</med> with communication challenges).  \n- Without data, <sym>acute risks</sym> like <sym>suicidality</sym>, <sym>delusions of harm</sym>, or <sym>self-neglect</sym> cannot be ruled out.  \n- The pattern suggests a need for **alternative assessment methods** to bypass self-report biases.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Immediate clinical interview:** Use open-ended questions and observe non-verbal cues (e.g., eye contact, responsiveness, thought coherence).  \n2. **Collateral assessment:** Engage with family/caregivers to gather behavioral observations (e.g., reported hallucinations, withdrawal, or erratic behavior.  \n3. **Mental status exam:** Assess for <sym>thought disorganization</sym>, <sym>psychomotor changes</sym>, or <sym>flat affect</sym> in person.  \n4. **Screen for medical causes:** Rule out <med>neurological disorders</med> (e.g., <med>delirium</med>, <med>dementia</med>), or <med>substance intoxication/withdrawal</med>).  \n5. **Safety planning:** Prioritize evaluation for <sym>suicidal/self-harm behavior</sym> using direct behavioral observation (e.g., \"When you think about this, what happens next?\").  \n6. **Cultural/communication assessment:** Explore if language barriers, trauma, or neurodivergent processing (e.g., <med>autism spectrum disorder</med>) are affecting your responses.  \n\nThis structured approach ensures we don\u2019t miss critical risks or misinterpret non-response as symptom absence.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this. The user provided a list of questions from a patient questionnaire, and all answers are \"No response provided.\" The task is to create a clinical summary based on that. \n\nFirst, I need to address each part of the query step by step. The user wants me to identify main symptoms, note response patterns, list potential clinical areas, highlight risks, and summarize in clinical terms.\n\nStarting with main symptoms and concerns. Since there are no answers, the lack of responses itself is a key point. The absence of data makes it hard to assess symptoms like depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, etc. That's a huge red flag because the questionnaire is meant to evaluate these areas.\n\nNext, patterns in responses. All 23 questions are unanswered. That's a pattern of non-engagement. Maybe the patient refused to answer, couldn't answer, or didn't understand the questions. It's important to consider possible reasons like resistance, cognitive impairment, or lack of motivation.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Since all questions are skipped, every area the questionnaire covers is in question. The questions cover depression (Q1, Q2), mania (Q3-Q5), anxiety (Q6-Q8), somatic symptoms (Q21, Q22), substance use (Q19, Q20, Q23), self-harm (Q10), psychosis (Q11-Q12), and dissociation (Q16-Q17). Without responses, all these areas are unassessed. \n\nRisk factors: The inability to assess for suicide risk (Q10) or substance use (Q19, Q20, Q23) is a big issue. Also, not knowing about psychotic symptoms (Q11-Q12) or severe anxiety could mean underlying issues are hidden. The patient might be at risk but we can't tell because of non-response.\n\nIn the summary, I need to use clinical terms. Maybe mention \"non-response to structured assessment\" and \"inability to evaluate symptom severity.\" Also note that this non-engagement itself is a clinical concern, possibly indicating barriers like refusal, cognitive issues, or communication problems.\n\nWait, am I missing anything? The user wants to avoid speculation. So I can't assume why they didn't answer, just state that non-response exists. Also, note that without data, standard assessments can't proceed, which might necessitate further evaluation through other methods.\n\nI need to make sure each numbered section from 1-5 in the response is covered concisely. Use terms like \"absence of responses precludes symptom identification\" and \"global non-engagement with screening instrument.\"\n\nAlso, highlight that without responses, we can't determine if they have depression, anxiety, etc. But the non-response itself is a problem that needs attention. Maybe suggest that in the summary, the next steps should involve a face-to-face interview to explore reasons for non-response.\n\nOkay, I think that covers it. Let me structure it step by step as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**:  \n   - Complete absence of responses to all 23 structured assessment questions across domains of mood, anxiety, psychosis, trauma-related symptoms, substance use, self-harm, cognitive functioning, and somatic complaints.  \n\n2. **Patterns in Responses**:  \n   - Global non-engagement with the screening instrument, with no responses provided for all questions.  \n   - No differentiation between symptom severity, frequency, or impact across assessed domains.  \n\n3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**:  \n   - **Mood disorders** (depression, bipolar mania, irritability).  \n   - **Anxiety disorders** (generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety).  \n   - **Psychosis** (auditory/visual hallucinations, thought disorder).  \n   - **Trauma-related symptoms** (intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors.  \n   - **Substance use** (alcohol, tobacco, or other substance misuse.  \n   - **Cognitive impairment** (memory deficits, disorientation.  \n   - **Suicidality/self-harm** (ideation or plans.  \n   - **Somatic symptoms** (unexplained physical complaints.  \n\n4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**:  \n   - Inability to assess **suicidal ideation** (Q10) or **psychotic symptoms** (Q11\u2013Q12), which may indicate unreported risk.  \n   - Non-response may reflect **resistance to assessment**, **cognitive impairment**, **communication barriers**, or **lack of engagement in treatment**.  \n   - Unassessed **substance use** (Q19\u2013Q23) or **risky behaviors** (Q5) could obscure underlying pathology or comorbidity.  \n\n5. **Summary**:  \n   The patient\u2019s **complete omission of responses** precludes identification of symptom severity, diagnostic considerations, or risk stratification. Non-response patterns may indicate barriers to assessment (e.g., intentional refusal, communication challenges, cognitive deficits, or lack of insight). Clinical follow-up is urgently required to address engagement and clarify:  \n   - Reasons for non-engagement (e.g., mistrust, alexithymia, or acute distress).  \n   - Presence of unreported psychiatric, cognitive, or medical conditions.  \n   - Acute risk (e.g., suicide, self-harm, or psychosis).  \n   - Need for alternative assessment modalities (e.g., clinician-led interview, collateral information).  \n\n**Clinical Implications**: Further evaluation must prioritize establishing rapport, exploring barriers to self-report, and directly assessing for acute risks (e.g., suicidal/homicidal ideation, psychosis) through structured clinical interviews or observational methods.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The conversation barely addressed any of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure dimensions. The therapist did not attempt to ask any specific questions from the DSM-5 questionnaire. Instead, they provided a summary and reasoning based on the absence of patient responses, which does not constitute an assessment of the dimensions. All 23 questions were ignored in favor of a general statement about potential diagnoses.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions or approach did not reflect DSM-5 criteria. The conversation did not include any specific clinical inquiries related to the DSM-5 dimensions. The language used was general and did not precisely target clinical symptoms as defined by the DSM-5. The focus was on speculative reasoning about possible diagnoses rather than direct clinical assessment.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue appears highly disconnected and lacking in logical progression. The therapist jumps directly to a diagnosis and recommended next steps without any systematic assessment or patient input. There are no questions or patient responses to build upon, leading to a conversation that seems random and not patient-centered.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis provided is speculative and based on the absence of patient responses rather than specific symptoms or DSM-5 criteria. The reasoning mentions several possible conditions (e.g., psychotic disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, cognitive impairment) but does not directly link these to specific patient symptoms or responses. The justification is partially flawed as it relies on non-response patterns rather than clinical data.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses show empathy and a professional tone. They acknowledge the patient's struggle to engage with the assessment and express concern for their situation. The language used is compassionate, and there is an effort to prioritize the patient's needs and risks. However, the conversation could benefit from more direct engagement and personalized interaction to improve the empathic connection."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation provided does not demonstrate a systematic or comprehensive assessment based on the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. It lacks direct clinical inquiry and relies heavily on speculative reasoning about potential diagnoses based on patient non-response. While the therapist's approach is compassionate, it falls short in covering essential DSM-5 dimensions, clinical relevance, and logical flow. Significant improvement is needed in directly assessing patient symptoms and tailoring the conversation to their specific experiences.",

It seems like there may be challenges with self-reporting, whether due to distress, confusion, or resistance to disclosure. Your struggle to answer these questions highlights the need for a more individualized approach to understand what you\u2019re experiencing. I want you to know this isn\u2019t a judgment of your situation\u2014my priority is to support you in clarifying your needs and risks.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional pending further evaluation. Non-response pattern suggestive of possible <med>psychotic disorder</med> (e.g., <med>schizophrenia</med> with impaired insight), <med>mood disorder with psychotic features</med>, or <med>cognitive impairment</med>).  \n\n**Reasoning:** The absence of responses across all items raises clinical concerns:  \n- **Non-response could reflect:**  \n  - <med>Psychosis</med> (e.g., delusions of being monitored, paranoia about the assessment, or inability to abstractly self-reflect due to disorganized thinking).  \n  - <med>Cognitive impairment</med> (e.g., <sym>difficulty comprehending questions</sym>, <sym>memory deficits</sym>, or <sym>attentional disruption</sym>.  \n  - <med>Depression/major depressive disorder</med> with <sym>anhedonia</sym> or <sym>apathy</sym>.  \n  - <med>Developmental disorder</med> (e.g., <med>autism spectrum disorder</med> with communication challenges).  \n- Without data, <sym>acute risks</sym> like <sym>suicidality</sym>, <sym>delusions of harm</sym>, or <sym>self-neglect</sym> cannot be ruled out.  \n- The pattern suggests a need for **alternative assessment methods** to bypass self-report biases.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Immediate clinical interview:** Use open-ended questions and observe non-verbal cues (e.g., eye contact, responsiveness, thought coherence).  \n2. **Collateral assessment:** Engage with family/caregivers to gather behavioral observations (e.g., reported hallucinations, withdrawal, or erratic behavior.  \n3. **Mental status exam:** Assess for <sym>thought disorganization</sym>, <sym>psychomotor changes</sym>, or <sym>flat affect</sym> in person.  \n4. **Screen for medical causes:** Rule out <med>neurological disorders</med> (e.g., <med>delirium</med>, <med>dementia</med>), or <med>substance intoxication/withdrawal</med>).  \n5. **Safety planning:** Prioritize evaluation for <sym>suicidal/self-harm behavior</sym> using direct behavioral observation (e.g., \"When you think about this, what happens next?\").  \n6. **Cultural/communication assessment:** Explore if language barriers, trauma, or neurodivergent processing (e.g., <med>autism spectrum disorder</med>) are affecting your responses.  \n\nThis structured approach ensures we don\u2019t miss critical risks or misinterpret non-response as symptom absence. Let\u2019s move forward with these steps at your pace.",
