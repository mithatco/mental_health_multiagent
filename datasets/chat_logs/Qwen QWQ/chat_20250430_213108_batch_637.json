      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reviewing the user's responses in detail. The patient's answers clearly indicate significant distress in social situations. They mention feeling less interested in activities when others are around, which points to social anxiety. The panic attack during a party (Q7) is a big red flag for social anxiety disorder. Their avoidance of social events and the physical symptoms like sweating and racing heart support that. \n\nLooking at the DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder, they check off key points like fear of negative evaluation, avoidance behaviors, and physiological reactions. The somatic symptoms like headaches and stomach aches in social settings (Q9) align with the somatic symptoms often seen in anxiety disorders. \n\nThe patient also reported intrusive thoughts about embarrassing themselves (Q16) and repetitive mental rehearsals of social interactions (Q17). That's more obsessive-like behaviors, but the context makes it seem rooted in anxiety rather than OCD. The depersonalization (Q18) could be a dissociative response to extreme anxiety, which is common in severe cases. \n\nI need to rule out other possibilities. They denied psychosis (Q12\u201313), suicidal thoughts (Q11), and substance use (Q21\u201323). No signs of depression (Q2 is more frustration than sadness), so depression is less likely. The panic attacks are situation-specific, which fits into SAD rather than a standalone panic disorder. \n\nThe structured criteria in DSM-5 for SAD include fear of judgment, physiological symptoms, avoidance, and significant distress. The patient\u2019s avoidance clearly impacts their life, like skipping events or avoiding deeper relationships (Q20). Somatic symptoms (Q9) could be part of SAD or possibly Somatic Symptom Disorder, but since they\u2019re tied to anxiety, SAD is the primary driver. \n\nThe recommendations should focus on CBT for social anxiety, maybe SSRIs if appropriate. Also, addressing the somatic symptoms by linking them to the anxiety. Ensuring they understands their symptoms are anxiety-related is key. Regular follow-up to track progress and adjust treatment is necessary. \n\nNeed to structure the response with the specified headings, tags, and points. Make sure to highlight the key diagnosis and reasoning clearly, using the required formatting.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest or pleasure in social activities</sym>, <sym>avoidance of group interactions</sym>, and <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym> are central themes in your responses. You described <quote>\"wishing to hide better\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like an outsider\"</quote>, which reflect profound distress linked to social contexts. Your efforts to manage this through avoidance and mental rehearsal are clear, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge how exhausting and isolating this must feel. You\u2019re not alone in this struggle\u2014many people experience what you describe, and effective treatments exist.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), likely with <med>panic features</med>, and possible <med>mild dissociative detachment</med> during acute stress.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe <sym>avoidance of social interactions</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms (e.g., panic attacks, somatic complaints)</sym> align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The panic attack described (Q7), somatic symptoms tied to social exposure (Q9), and compulsive mental rehearsal (Q17) fulfill DSM-5 criteria for SAD. The dissociative sensations (Q18) likely represent <med>dissociation from acute anxiety</med>, not a separate disorder. No evidence supports <med>mood disorders</med> (Q2, Q11), <med>psychosis</med> (Q12), Q13), or <med>OCD</med> (Q16 content is anxiety-driven, not obsessive).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focused on exposure-based techniques for social anxiety**, starting with low-pressure social interactions.  \n2. **Monitor for somatic symptoms**: Address <sym>cardiac palpitations</sym> and <sym>GI distress</sym> through relaxation training and grounding techniques during anxiety triggers.  \n3. **Consider <med>sertraline</med> or <med>dapoxetine</med> for panic features, if tolerated. Start low-dose and track response.  \n4. **Psychoeducate on <sym>safety-seeking behaviors</sym> (e.g., overrehearsing lines) and replace them with gradual exposure exercises.  \n5. **Assess for <med>dissociative detachment</med> via the Peritraumatic Dissociation Scale if episodes increase in frequency/severity.  \n6. **Rule out <med>hyperthyroidism</med> or <med>mitral valve prolapse</med> for persistent somatic symptoms via primary care referral.  \n7. **Track <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) with sleep hygiene interventions (e.g., limiting screens before bed, scheduled relaxation routines).  \n\nNext steps should prioritize reducing avoidance while validating the intensity of your <sym>self-consciousness</sym>. You\u2019re responding to these challenges in ways that make sense given how overwhelmed you feel, and this is treatable.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a patient's answers to the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure, and I need to analyze them according to the specified points.\n\nFirst, I need to read through each question and answer carefully. The patient's responses seem to focus on social situations causing distress. Let's start with the main symptoms. The first question is about lack of interest or pleasure. The patient says they don't enjoy things as much when others are around. That's a key point for anhedonia, but specifically in social contexts. \n\nMoving to question 2, they mention frustration with self-consciousness rather than sadness. So maybe more anxiety than depression, but there's some overlap. The third question about irritability is linked to socializing, so again, social anxiety might be a factor. \n\nQuestion 4: They have trouble sleeping, lying awake worrying about social stuff. That's insomnia related to anxiety. \n\nQuestion 5: Not starting projects because they don't want attention. Avoidant behavior, which is a big sign. \n\nQuestion 6 and 7 are about anxiety and panic, with physical symptoms like sweating, racing heart, and panic attacks. They had a panic episode at a party. So panic disorder? Or social anxiety with panic features. \n\nAvoidance in question 8: skipping events, staying home. High avoidance behavior. \n\nQuestion 9: Physical symptoms like stomach aches before events and headaches in social interactions. Somatic symptoms linked to anxiety. \n\nQuestion 10: They don't feel their issues are taken seriously, but they try to ignore it. Maybe some sense of invalidation, but not sure if that's significant. \n\nQuestion 11: No self-harm thoughts, so that's a relief. \n\nQuestions 12-13: No psychosis symptoms. \n\nQuestion 14: Sleep problems due to rumination, so insomnia with cognitive intrusion. \n\nQuestion 15: Memory issues in social contexts, like forgetting words when being watched. Could be social anxiety impacting cognitive performance. \n\nQuestion 16-17: Intrusive thoughts about embarrassing moments and repetitive behaviors like rehearsing lines. That's obsessive-compulsive features, but more likely related to social anxiety. \n\nQuestion 18: Depersonalization sometimes when in groups. This could be a dissociative symptom, which sometimes occurs with anxiety. \n\nQuestion 19: Knows their goals but avoids due to fear. Avoidant behavior due to anxiety. \n\nQuestion 20: Difficulty forming close relationships, keeping conversations superficial. Avoidant personality traits? \n\nQuestions 21-23: No substance use, which is good, but they rely on avoidance. \n\nPatterns: All symptoms are exacerbated by social situations. The patient's anxiety, avoidance, physical symptoms, and cognitive issues all seem tied to social interactions. There's no suicidal or psychotic thoughts, so that's ruled out. \n\nPotential clinical areas: Social anxiety disorder is the most prominent. The panic attacks (Q7), somatic symptoms (Q9), avoidance (Q8, Q20), and the intrusive thoughts (Q16) all align with SAD. The depersonalization (Q18) might be a coping mechanism. \n\nRisk factors: The high levels of anxiety and avoidance could lead to social isolation. The panic episodes indicate moderate to severe anxiety. The rumination and cognitive issues could impact daily functioning. They don't report self-harm, but their avoidance might affect their quality of life.\n\nWait, are there any other disorders here? The intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors (rehearsing lines) might hint at OCD, but the content is all related to social anxiety, so maybe secondary. The depersonalization isn't severe but is a dissociative response. \n\nNeed to make sure I don't miss anything. The patient's main issues are clearly around social anxiety. The physical symptoms, avoidance, and emotional distress are all there. The key points are social anxiety with panic features, significant avoidance leading to impairment, and somatic symptoms. \n\nI should structure the answer according to the user's requirements: main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risks, and a summary. Make sure to use clinical terms like 'anhedonia in social contexts', 'social avoidance', 'panic attacks', 'somatic symptoms', etc. \n\nCheck if there's anything else. The patient doesn't report mania or psychosis, so bipolar or schizophrenia not indicated. The substance use is negative. The key is to focus on the anxiety-related responses. \n\nOkay, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n### 1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social Anxiety-Related Symptoms**:  \n  - Anhedonia in social contexts (Q1), frustration over self-consciousness (Q2), irritability in social situations (Q3), avoidance of social events (Q8, Q20), and panic episodes (Q7) with physical symptoms (sweaty hands, racing heart, chest tightness).  \n  - **Somatic Symptoms**: Gastrointestinal distress (stomach pain, headaches) in social settings (Q9).  \n- **Cognitive/Behavioral Features**:  \n  - Intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts about social performance (Q16), compulsive mental rehearsal of social interactions (Q17), and sleep disturbance due to rumination (Q14).  \n  - Avoidant coping strategies (e.g., skipping events, keeping superficial relationships).  \n- **Emotional Dysregulation**: Frustration, self-criticism, and anxiety (Q2, Q6).  \n\n### 2. **Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Social Situations as Trigger**: Symptoms (e.g., panic, avoidance, somatic complaints) consistently worsen in social or performance contexts (e.g., parties, group interactions, public speaking).  \n- **Avoidance as Primary Coping Mechanism**: Systematic withdrawal from anxiety-provoking situations (Q8, Q20), leading to functional impairment.  \n- **Self-Criticism and Performance Anxiety**: Overfocus on perceived social failures (e.g., fear of embarrassment, negative self-assessment).  \n\n### 3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Core features include fear of scrutiny, avoidance, physiological reactivity, and significant impairment in social functioning (Q1\u2013Q3, Q6\u2013Q8, Q16).  \n- **Panic Disorder with Social Context**: Panic attacks triggered by social exposure (Q7), though limited to one described episode.  \n- **Anxiety-Related Somatic Symptoms**: Gastrointestinal and autonomic arousal (Q6\u2013Q9).  \n- **Possible Obsessive-Compulsive Features**: Intrusive thoughts and mental rehearsal of social scenarios (Q16\u2013Q17), though likely secondary to anxiety rather than OCD.  \n- **Social Avoidance and Relationship Disturbances**: Shallow relationships due to fear of rejection (Q20, Q19).  \n\n### 4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Significant avoidance of social/occupational activities (Q8, Q20), suggesting moderate to severe SAD.  \n- **Physical Symptoms**: Panic episodes (Q7), autonomic hyperarousal (Q6), and somatic complaints (Q9) may warrant medical evaluation to rule out alternate etiologies (e.g., hyperthyroidism), though psychosocial stressors are primary.  \n- **Psychosocial Risk**: Pervasive self-consciousness and fear of judgment may perpetuate avoidance cycles, impairing interpersonal and occupational functioning.  \n\n### 5. **Summary (Clinical Language)**  \nThe patient exhibits **marked social anxiety disorder (SAD)** with physiological hyperarousal (elevated heart rate, diaphoresis), panic symptoms in social contexts (panic attack described in Q7), and avoidance behavior leading to functional impairment (Q8, Q20). Symptoms are exacerbated by perceived scrutiny, with cognitive features including intrusive self-critical thoughts (Q16) and anticipatory anxiety (e.g., rumination about social performance, Q14). Somatic symptoms (Q9) and mild dissociative episodes (Q18) during group interactions suggest secondary dissociation in response to anxiety. No suicidal ideation or psychotic features. The patient\u2019s avoidant coping strategies (Q5, Q8) and superficial social engagement (Q20) indicate a pattern of **social withdrawal** likely maintaining symptoms. A formal diagnosis of SAD is strongly supported, with possible comorbid **generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** given pervasive worry (Q6). Further evaluation for **avoidant personality disorder** traits (Q19, Q20) or **specific phobia** (social) may be warranted. Medical evaluation for somatic complaints should exclude alternate diagnoses, but psychosocial stressors are primary.  \n\n**Recommendations**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety, interoceptive exposure, and gradual social exposure. Consider SSRIs or SNRIs as adjuncts if tolerated. Assess for safety and reinforce engagement in evidence-based interventions.",
