I need to highlight the patient's struggles with social anxiety and panic attacks, showing empathy. \n\nNext, I must list the diagnosis under the **Diagnosis:** header. The primary diagnosis here is Social Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. I should also mention the Panic Attacks as a specifier, and maybe consider the somatic symptoms and repetitive behaviors as part of the anxiety, not a separate disorder.\n\nIn the Reasoning section, I need to link the symptoms to DSM-5 criteria. The patient's avoidance, panic attacks in social contexts, and physical symptoms all point to social anxiety. The repetitive behaviors (checking appearance, rehearsing lines) are safety behaviors, not OCD. Somatic symptoms are tied to anxiety, so Somatic Symptom Disorder isn't primary here. Cultural considerations might be relevant if they mentioned cultural factors, but they didn't, so focus on the provided info.\n\nFor Next Steps, recommend CBT, exposure therapy, panic management, and possibly SSRIs. Also address the perceived stigma and validate their experience to build trust. Maybe include a referral for a physical exam to rule out other issues, even though the user said not to consider Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted. Since the patient mentioned unexplained aches, maybe a brief note on ruling out medical causes.\n\nMake sure all medical terms are in <med> tags, symptoms in <sym> tags, and quotes from the patient's answers in <quote> tags. Avoid any markdown beyond the specified tags. Check for structure: compassionate summary, Diagnosis heading, Reasoning, and Next Steps with numbered points.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to review the patient's answers to the DSM-5 questions and analyze their responses. Let's go step by step.\n\nStarting with Q1: The patient says they have little interest or pleasure. They mentioned that social situations are a bigger issue. So maybe it's not depression but social anxiety affecting their activities. \n\nQ2 addresses feeling down or hopeless. The patient's answer links this to social situations. That suggests the depression might be situation-specific, not a general depression. \n\nQ3 is about irritability. The patient mentions getting short-tempered when pressured to socialize. So the irritability is context-dependent. \n\nQ4: Sleep issues. The patient has disrupted sleep, either sleeping too much or too little, and feeling tired. That's common in anxiety disorders. \n\nQ5: More projects or risky behavior? Patient says no, avoids projects involving people. So no hypomania here. \n\nQ6: Anxiety symptoms\u2014nervous, on edge. They describe physical symptoms like racing heart and sweating. That's classic anxiety, especially social anxiety. \n\nQ7: Panic attacks. They've had panic attacks during presentations, with physical symptoms. That's a big red flag for panic disorder or social anxiety with panic features. \n\nQ8: Avoidance. They avoid social situations, which is a key point. Avoidance is a major sign of social anxiety disorder. \n\nQ9: Somatic symptoms like stomach aches and shaking. These are somatic responses to anxiety. \n\nQ10: They feel their issues aren't taken seriously. Maybe they've been dismissed before, leading to reluctance in seeking help. \n\nQ11: No self-harm intent. But feeling trapped and wanting to disappear. This is important because they don't have suicidal thoughts, but the distress is significant. \n\nQ12-14: No psychosis. So no hallucinations or thought insertion. \n\nQ15: Sleep problems affecting memory. They have trouble remembering during meetings due to anxiety. \n\nQ16: Repeated unpleasant thoughts about past social interactions. That sounds like intrusive thoughts, possibly OCD features but more likely part of anxiety. \n\nQ17: Repetitive behaviors like checking appearance or rehearsing lines. Could be compulsions, but more like safety behaviors in social anxiety to reduce anxiety. \n\nNow, listing the main symptoms: \n\nSocial anxiety is a major theme here. Avoidance, panic attacks, physical symptoms, intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbance. The patient is experiencing significant impairment in social functioning. \n\nPatterns: The patient's symptoms are triggered by social situations. All the negative responses are tied to social interactions. So the core issue is social anxiety. \n\nClinical significance: Social anxiety disorder with possible Panic Attacks. The avoidance is definitely affecting their life. The somatic symptoms and intrusive thoughts are significant. \n\nRisk factors: The patient isn't suicidal but feels trapped. The feeling that their issues aren't taken seriously might lead to under-treatment. Their avoidance could lead to worsening isolation. \n\nPutting this into clinical terms: The patient presents with prominent social anxiety disorder with panic attacks. They have significant avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms triggered by social stressors, and intrusive thoughts related to past social interactions. They experience sleep disturbances and repetitive coping mechanisms like rehearsing lines and checking appearance. No suicidal intent, but distress and functional impairment are notable. \n\nWait, they mentioned the somatic symptoms like stomach aches and shaking. Also, the repetitive behaviors (checking appearance, rehearsing) are almost ritualistic but more about anxiety. The key points are social anxiety with panic features and significant avoidance. The feeling that their illness isn't taken seriously is important for treatment adherence. The lack of psychosis or suicidal thoughts rules out other disorders. \n\nI should make sure not to miss anything. Let me check all the questions again. \n\nQ17's compulsive-like behaviors might suggest some OCD elements, but since they're linked to social anxiety, it's more about anxiety-driven compulsions. \n\nSo the main concern is Social Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks. The summary should highlight the core diagnosis, the associated symptoms, and the functional impact from avoidance and panic. Also note the somatic symptoms and repetitive behaviors as part of the anxiety response. The clinical significance includes impairment in social functioning and possible under-recognition of their condition. The risk factors include the impact of perceived lack of understanding from others. \n\nNeed to structure the answer as per the user's request: main symptoms, patterns, areas of significance, risks, then summary. \n\nDouble-checking the DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder: Fear of scrutiny in social situations leading to anxiety, avoidance, and significant distress. Panic attacks during feared social situations are common. The patient's panic attacks during presentations fit. \n\nThe repetitive behaviors (checking appearance, rehearsing lines) could be safety behaviors, but not necessarily OCD unless they are time-consuming or cause distress. The patient mentions feeling compelled to do them, but the primary issue is the anxiety driving them. \n\nOkay, so I'll structure the answer accordingly.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns**  \n- **Social anxiety disorder**: Marked fear, avoidance, and physical symptoms (e.g., panic attacks, somatic reactions like tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress) triggered by social/performance situations.  \n- **Panic disorder with social triggers**: Panic attacks (e.g., during presentations) with somatic manifestations (trembling, dyspnea) and anticipatory anxiety.  \n- **Repetitive, anxiety-driven behaviors**: Compensatory rituals (e.g., excessive self-checking, rehearsing social interactions).  \n- **Psychological distress**: Intrusive, ruminative thoughts about perceived social failures and hypervigilance to others\u2019 judgments.  \n- **Sleep disruption**: Insomnia or non-restorative sleep due to social stress preoccupation.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses**  \n- **Socially mediated symptom exacerbation**: Nearly all symptoms (anxiety, panic, avoidance, somatic distress) are contextually linked to social/performance obligations.  \n- **Functional impairment**: Avoidance of social obligations (e.g., parties, meetings) disrupts daily functioning and relationships.  \n- **Stigma perception**: Reports feeling misunderstood (Q10), potentially impeding help-seeking behavior.  \n- **Safety behaviors**: Repetitive coping strategies (e.g., rehearsing lines) to mitigate anxiety.  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**  \n- **Panic disorder with social phobia comorbidity**: Panic attacks in social contexts suggest comorbid conditions requiring targeted intervention.  \n- **Physical comorbidities**: Somatic symptoms (e.g., GI distress, tachycardia) warrant mindful evaluation for autonomic dysregulation.  \n- **Social withdrawal**: Chronic avoidance may lead to worsening social isolation and comorbid depressive symptoms.  \n- **Cognitive distortions**: Excessive self-monitoring and catastrophizing about social interactions (Q16/Q17).  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs**  \n- **Avoidance behaviors**: Escalation could lead to occupational/interpersonal dysfunction.  \n- **Perceived invalidation**: Q10 indicates possible mistrust of healthcare providers, risking disengagement from treatment.  \n- **High psychological distress**: Persistent anxiety and avoidance may contribute to secondary depressive symptoms (Q2, Q3).  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary**  \nThe patient presents with a **prolonged, contextually driven anxiety disorder**, likely **social anxiety disorder with panic attacks**, as evidenced by:  \n- **Core features**: Severe anticipatory and situational anxiety, avoidance of social/performance scenarios, and panic attacks with somatic symptoms (tachycardia, dyspnea).  \n- **Functional impact**: Impaired social, occupational, and interpersonal functioning due to avoidance.  \n- **Associated features**: Intrusive anxious thoughts (Q16/Q17), sleep disturbance (Q15), and somatic symptoms (Q9/Q14).  \n- **Psychosocial context**: History of perceived stigma (Q10), which may affect engagement in treatment.  \n\n**Recommendations**: Further evaluation for social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, with attention to comorbid cognitive-behavioral features (e.g., safety behaviors). Treatment should prioritize CBT targeting social anxiety, interoceptive exposure for panic, and psychoeducation to address perceived invalidation. Monitor for potential comorbid depression or adjustment disorder if avoidance exacerbates isolation.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Difficulty engaging in social situations</sym>, <sym>panic attacks during presentations</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of public scrutiny</sym> highlight profound distress tied to social interactions. Your descriptions of feeling trapped, physically unwell in social settings, and the toll of constant self-monitoring convey the weight of this burden. It sounds like these experiences have profoundly limited your life, yet your efforts to manage them with rehearsing and checking show your resilience.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) with Panic Attacks</med> (DSM-5 criteria met for both conditions).  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> is supported by persistent <sym>avoidance of social/performance situations</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym>, and <sym>marked distress in feared settings</sym> (Q1, Q2, Q8, Q9). Panic Attacks (<med>Panic Disorder</med>) are evidenced by <sym>sudden episodes of intense fear</sym> with <sym>physical symptoms (e.g., trembling, shortness of breath</sym> during specific social triggers (Q7). <sym>Ruminative thoughts about social failures</sym> (Q16/Q17) align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\u2019s cognitive features, not <med>OCD</med> or psychotic symptoms (no hallucinations/Q12/Q13). <sym>Somatic symptoms</sym> (e.g., stomach aches, shaking) are best understood as anxiety-mediated, not primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target <sym>social anxiety</sym> via gradual exposure, cognitive restructuring of catastrophic thoughts (e.g., \"Everyone thinks I\u2019m awkward\"), and techniques to reduce avoidance.  \n2. **Panic management skills:** Teach grounding techniques for acute panic episodes (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness) and address <sym>interoceptive exposure</sym> to normalize physical symptoms.  \n3. **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI):** Consider <med>sertraline</med> or <med>venlafaxine</med> for <sym>anxiety reduction</sym>; start low-dose and monitor.  \n4. **Functional restoration:** Collaborate on small, incremental social exposures (e.g., brief greetings) to rebuild tolerance.  \n5. **Psychoeducation:** Validate experiences (<quote>\"I hate admitting these struggles\"</quote>) to reduce shame and reinforce <sym>worry</sym>\u2019s cognitive/emotional basis.  \n6. **Referral to a specialist:** Engage a therapist with expertise in <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> for tailored exposure therapy.  \n7. **Routine well-being tracking:** Use a daily journal to differentiate <sym>physical symptoms</sym> from anxiety vs. true medical issues (e.g., rule out GI disorders).  \n\nThis approach addresses both <sym>avoidance cycles</sym> and <sym>panic symptomatology</sym>, while addressing your concerns about being misunderstood (<quote>\"I hate admitting these struggles\"</quote>).  \n\n---  \n**Critical exclusion:**  \n- <med>Panic Disorder</med> is included due to panic episodes tied to social triggers, not in isolation.  \n- <sym>Ruminative thoughts</sym> and <sym>safety behaviors</sym> are secondary to social anxiety, not indicative of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> or psychotic processes.  \n- Somatic symptoms are contextualized within anxiety and stress, aligning with DSM-5\u2019s emphasis on behavioral/cognitive components over primary somatic focus.  \n\nTreatment should balance acute symptom relief (e.g., SSRIs) with long-term CBT for cognitive restructuring.",
