      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reviewing the user's responses to the 23 questions. The patient's answers point to significant anxiety, especially in social contexts. They mentioned avoiding promotions and social events, which is a big red flag for social anxiety disorder. The recurring thoughts about others judging them (Q16, Q17) and physical symptoms like shaking and headaches (Q6, Q9) support this. \n\nLooking at the diagnostic criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), now Social Anxiety Disorder in DSM-5), the patient's avoidance behaviors and distress fit. They also have panic attacks (Q7) which might suggest Panic Disorder, but those seem linked to social triggers, so it might be part of SAD. \n\nThe repetitive thoughts about humiliation (Q16) and checking behaviors (Q17) might hint at obsessive-compulsive traits, but they\u2019re clearly tied to anxiety about social evaluation. The depersonalization (Q18) during social interactions could be a dissociative response to extreme anxiety, which is common in severe cases. \n\nNo signs of psychotic symptoms (Q12, Q13), substance abuse (Q21\u201323), or suicidal intent (Q11), so I can rule those out. The sleep issues (Q14) and avoidance directly impact their work and relationships, indicating significant functional impairment. \n\nPutting this all together, Social Anxiety Disorder seems primary. The panic attacks and dissociation (depersonalization) could be part of the anxiety spectrum. GAD might also be present because of the constant worry. But since the anxiety is clearly tied to social evaluation, SAD is the main diagnosis.\n\nNext steps would involve CBT for social anxiety, sleep hygiene, and possibly medication like SSRIs. They might need behavioral experiments to face social situations gradually. The dissociation during panic could be addressed through grounding techniques. Need to check if the panic attacks meet criteria for Panic Disorder, but since they\u2019re context-specific, they might be part of SAD. \n\nMake sure to structure the answer exactly as specified, using the required tags and sections. Avoid extra diagnosis speculation beyond what's supported. Use the tags correctly for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. Ensure empathy in the first paragraph.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Symptoms of social anxiety and avoidance</sym> <sym>physical symptoms like shaking, headaches, and panic</sym> and <sym>repetitive, self-critical thoughts</sym> seem to dominate your experience.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this clinical assessment. The user provided the patient's answers to the 23 DSM-5 questions. My job is to break down the responses into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical significance, risk factors, and a summary.\n\nStarting with the main symptoms. The patient talks about little interest in activities (Q1) due to social anxiety. Then feeling down or hopeless (Q2), but not due to depression, more from social anxiety. They mentioned avoiding social situations (Q8) like turning down promotions, skipping dinners. The physical symptoms like shaking, stomach issues (Q6, Q9) are anxiety-related. They also had panic attacks (Q7) occasionally. The repetitive thoughts (Q16, Q17) might point to OCD traits, but the patient mentions checking texts or rehearsing conversations, which could be safety behaviors. The depersonalization (Q18) during social events is notable. They don't have suicidal thoughts (Q11) or substance abuse (Q21-23), which is good.\n\nPatterns: The responses consistently point to social anxiety as the core issue. The patient's avoidance behaviors (Q5, Q8) and physical symptoms in social contexts are recurring themes. They also have intrusive thoughts (Q16, Q17) which might be anxiety-driven.\n\nClinical significance areas: Social Anxiety Disorder is the main one. The avoidance is impairing their work (promotions) and relationships (Q20). The panic attacks and depersonalization (Q17, Q18) might add PTSD or a related disorder, but given the context, it's likely part of anxiety. The repetitive thoughts could be part of obsessive-compulsive symptoms but need more exploration.\n\nRisk factors: They don't mention self-harm or suicidal intent, so low risk there. The isolation due to avoidance could lead to worsening mental health. The insomnia (Q14) from rumination is another concern, affecting their overall functioning.\n\nSummary needs to be concise, using terms like Social Anxiety Disorder, possible comorbidities, and the impact on daily life. Avoid speculating beyond what's stated. Make sure to note the absence of psychotic symptoms (Q12, Q13) and substance use. Mention the functional impairment in social and occupational areas. Also, the depersonalization should be noted as it's a symptom they experience during anxiety.\n\nWait, in Q16 they have repetitive negative thoughts about social interactions. That could be linked to social anxiety's cognitive aspects. The checking behaviors (Q17) might be compulsions to manage anxiety. The depersonalization is part of the anxiety response. Need to ensure all key points are covered without overstepping the data. Also, note the patient's self-awareness and desire for connection (Q20), which is important for treatment planning but maybe not in the summary here. Focus on clinical aspects. The insomnia and physical symptoms are significant. Okay, structure all that into the required sections.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Social Anxiety/Phobia**: Marked avoidance of social interactions, diminished interest in activities, and significant anxiety in social situations (Q1, Q6, Q8, Q20).  \n- **Physical Somatic Symptoms**: Anxiety-related physiological responses (e.g., tremors, gastrointestinal distress, headaches) during social engagement (Q6, Q9).  \n- **Functional Impairment**: Avoidance of career advancement (e.g., refusing promotions requiring social interaction) and strained relationships due to withdrawal (Q5, Q8, Q20).  \n- **Recurrent Intrusive Thoughts**: Persistent self-critical or anticipatory worries about social judgment (Q16, Q17).  \n- **Sleep Disturbance**: Difficulty initiating sleep due to rumination about social interactions (Q14.  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Avoidance as Primary Coping Mechanism**: Systematic evasion of social/performative situations (e.g., declining promotions, isolating in quiet spaces).  \n- **Anxiety as Central Driver**: Physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms all tied to social anxiety (Q1, Q6, Q9, Q16, Q18).  \n- **Self-Reported Insight**: Acknowledgement of impairment but no psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse (Q12, Q13, Q11, Q21\u2013Q23).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**: Strongly indicated by persistent fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of social situations, and functional impairment.  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Widespread anxiety about social interactions, with physical symptoms and repetitive worry (Q6, Q16).  \n- **Panic Disorder**: History of panic attacks in social contexts (Q7.  \n- **Possible Comorbid Depersonalization/Derealization**: Transient episodes described during social stressors (Q18.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Occupational Impairment**: Avoidance of career opportunities due to social anxiety (Q5, Q8.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance**: Insomnia due to rumination, potentially exacerbating anxiety (Q14.  \n- **Social Isolation**: Self-reported desire for connection but inability to engage (Q20.  \n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with **clinically significant social anxiety disorder**, characterized by marked avoidance of social interactions, recurrent anticipatory anxiety, and physical symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, gastrointestinal distress). Comorbid features include generalized anxiety (Q6, Q16), transient depersonalization during anxiety (Q18), and sleep disturbance (Q14. No acute risk of self-harm or psychosis (Q11, Q12\u2013Q13. The patient\u2019s functioning is impaired in occupational and interpersonal domains due to avoidance behaviors (Q5, Q8, Q20. A structured clinical interview is recommended to confirm diagnostic criteria and evaluate for comorbid panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Q16\u2013Q17. Treatment focus should prioritize CBT for social anxiety, addressing safety behaviors (e.g., excessive preparation for social interactions), and sleep hygiene interventions.",
