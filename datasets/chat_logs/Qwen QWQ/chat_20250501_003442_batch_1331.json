      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through the patient's answers again to make sure I don't miss anything. The user provided a structured response to the DSM-5 questionnaire, and I need to analyze each question and answer carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Q1 and Q2, the patient mentions some days without pleasure and feeling down, but they downplay it as stress. That makes me think maybe mild depression symptoms, but not severe enough yet. The patient says they still get things done, so functional impairment isn't obvious, but the presence of some anhedonia and low mood is there.\n\nThen Q3: irritability. They acknowledge being snappier but dismiss it as normal. Could be part of a mood disorder. Q4 talks about sleeping less but having lots of energy. That's interesting because it's a mix of insomnia and high energy, which might point towards hypomanic episodes, especially when combined with the risky behaviors in Q5. The patient mentions risky projects and vague risky activities, which they avoid discussing directly. That plus the high energy could hint at bipolar II or substance-induced mania. \n\nSubstance use is a big red flag here. They use alcohol to manage anxiety (Q6, Q7) and mentions drinking late, which might indicate substance use disorder. The DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder require evaluating patterns of use leading to impairment. Their use of alcohol to self-medicate panic (Q6, Q7) is a concern, and avoiding situations when drinking (Q8) hints at possible social impairment. \n\nThe somatic symptoms (Q9, Q10) with back pain and feeling dismissed by doctors might suggest somatic symptom disorder, but the patient's dismissal of it and focus on stress makes me think it's more related to anxiety or depression. However, the DSM-5 requires excessive thoughts/behaviors around symptoms for SSD, and the patient's answers don't clearly meet that. So maybe that's less likely.\n\nThey denied self-harm (Q11) which is good, but the existential stress mentioned could still be part of a mood disorder.\n\nPutting this all together: The key points are the combination of depressive symptoms, possible hypomanic features, and substance use. The patient's use of alcohol to cope with anxiety and their risky behaviors point towards a potential bipolar spectrum disorder or a substance use disorder complicating an underlying mood disorder. The substance use might be masking or exacerbating symptoms, so it's important to assess for <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> and consider a mixed presentation.\n\nI need to make sure not to assume without evidence. Since they have some manic symptoms (insomnia+energy, risk-taking) and depressive symptoms, maybe a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with atypical features, or a <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> in partial remission. But without a full manic episode, it's tricky. Also, the alcohol use could be complicating things, so <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> is a strong contender here.\n\nWait, the DSM-5 combines substance abuse and dependence into <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, and they have at least two criteria (using to cope with anxiety, risky situations), so that's a possibility. The depressive symptoms are mild but present, so maybe a dual diagnosis.\n\nAlternatively, the patient's pattern of minimizing and externalizing could suggest some level of denial, common in substance use disorders. The somatic symptoms might be secondary to stress or anxiety rather than SSD, since they don't have excessive preoccupation with them beyond \"doctors said it's fine.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the primary concerns are:  \n- Possible <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood</med>, given the context of stress and transient symptoms.  \n- <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> with anxiolytic misuse and potential impairment.  \n- <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> given the nervousness and panic attacks managed via substance use.  \n- Risk for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> due to hypomania indicators (elevated energy with risk-taking, but not clearly meeting full criteria), warranting further assessment.  \n\nThe diagnosis should prioritize the most impairing conditions first. Since the substance use is impacting mood and anxiety, and the mood symptoms aren't severe enough for bipolar, maybe start with <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>, with monitoring for bipolar features. Also, the somatic symptoms don't meet SSD criteria yet, so maybe not needed here.\n\nWait, but the patient mentioned \"back aches\" and feeling like illnesses aren't taken seriously. The DSM-5 SSD requires excessive thoughts or behaviors related to symptoms, which they didn't state clearly. They say doctors said it's fine, so maybe not SSD. More likely, their somatic complaints are stress-related.\n\nSo the main issues: depression, anxiety, substance use.\n\n**Diagnosis:** The primary concerns are likely <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (alcohol) exacerbating symptoms, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>). The risk of <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> requires further evaluation due to elevated mood/risk-taking.\n\nBut need to check DSM-5 criteria. For Alcohol Use Disorder, two criteria would be: using in larger amounts/longer time (if applicable?), craving, continued use despite problems (like social avoidance?), but the answers mention using to cope, and avoiding crowds when drinking. Maybe meets 2+ criteria. \n\nThe depressive symptoms don't meet full MDD criteria yet (only 2 weeks, maybe not enough symptoms for full diagnosis). Since it's a two-week period, maybe <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Disturbance</med> is more accurate if triggered by stressors. But the answers don't specify stressors.\n\nAlternatively, the mood and substance use are intertwined. The key is to not overreach but note the possibilities.\n\nThe structured assessment requires a primary diagnosis. Since the patient's depressive symptoms are mild but present, along with substance use and anxiety, perhaps the leading diagnosis would be <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (mild) with co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>. But need to check if the symptoms align.\n\nAlternatively, the mixed symptoms of high energy with risk-taking (Q4, Q5) plus depressive elements could hint at <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> in a hypomanic phase, but without a full episode, it's a risk factor. \n\nWait, hypomania requires at least 4 days of elevated mood with 3 criteria, which they may not meet. So not sure yet. \n\nThe key points to include in the assessment are the substance use, possible mood dysregulation, and anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis should reflect the most prominent issues. Since they're using alcohol to cope, and there's some depressive and anxiety symptoms, the primary diagnosis might be <med>Substance-Induced Mood Disorder</med>, but that's if the symptoms are directly due to substance use. However, if the mood symptoms predate or are separate, it's comorbid.\n\nAlternatively, given the DSM-5 criteria, perhaps <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (mild) with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Mild Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> if symptoms have been there for a longer period. But since the time frame is two weeks, maybe adjustment disorder.\n\nHmm, tricky. The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure might not capture all criteria, so this is based on limited data. The primary diagnosis could be <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol) with <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety management</sym> as key factors. \n\nAlso, the irritability and energy with risk-taking might suggest a mixed mood state, but not enough for bipolar. \n\nThe final diagnosis should be: \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <sym>risk of bipolar spectrum features</sym>.  \n\nWait, but does the MDD criteria are met? The DSM-5 requires at least 5 symptoms for MDD. The patient has anhedonia (Q1) and depressed mood (Q2), \"feeling down\"), which is two symptoms. Not enough for full MDD, so maybe adjustment disorder? \n\nAlternatively, <med>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> as primary. \n\nAlternatively, if the alcohol use is the main driver, the primary diagnosis could be <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety</med> and depressive symptoms. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder requires at least 2-3 criteria. The patient's alcohol use to cope with anxiety (Q6, Q8) and continued use despite problems (e.g., avoiding situations when drinking) could meet 2+ criteria. \n\nSo the main diagnosis would be <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (mild to moderate severity based on responses), and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (maybe generalized) plus depressive symptoms not meeting full MDD criteria, so <med>Adjustment Disorder with Anxious-Mixed Disturbance</med>. But I need to structure this properly.\n\nAlternatively,",

The user wants me to act as a clinical mental health professional reviewing these patient responses. First, I need to go through each question and answer to identify the key points.\n\nStarting with Q1: Little interest or pleasure. The patient says \"not too much,\" but mentions being tired but still functional. Maybe some anhedonia, but they downplay it. \n\nQ2 is about feeling down or hopeless. They mention a couple of days and attribute it to stress, which might indicate mild depressive symptoms but they think it's temporary. \n\nQ3: Irritability. They acknowledge being snappier but dismiss it as normal. Could be a sign of underlying mood issues or stress. \n\nQ4: Sleeping less but still lots of energy. They mention staying up late with alcohol. This might be a mixed state or substance use affecting sleep. \n\nQ5: Starting more projects or risky behavior. The patient is vague but acknowledges taking risks. This could hint at hypomanic episodes or impulsive behavior linked to substance use. \n\nQ6 and Q7: Anxiety and panic. They report anxiety managed with alcohol, and occasional panic attacks. Using substances to cope is a concern. \n\nQ8: Avoiding situations due to anxiety, but only when drinking. Maybe social anxiety or substance-induced issues. \n\nQ9 and Q10: Physical aches and feeling illnesses aren't taken seriously. Back pain dismissed as posture, but possible somatic symptoms due to stress or anxiety. \n\nQ11: No suicidal thoughts, which is good, but they mention life is hard. Need to ensure that's consistent. \n\nMain symptoms: Anhedonia (Q1), mild depressive symptoms (Q2), irritability (Q3), possible substance use (alcohol in Q4,6,8), risky behavior (Q5), anxiety/panic (Q6,7), somatic symptoms (Q9,10). \n\nPatterns: Downplaying symptoms, externalizing (blaming stress, others), using alcohol to cope, defensive about risk-taking. \n\nClinical areas: Depressive features, anxiety, possible bipolar spectrum (mix of energy and risky behavior), substance use as a coping mechanism, somatic complaints. \n\nRisk factors: Alcohol use as a coping strategy (which can worsen mental health), risky behaviors mentioned in Q5, but no current suicide risk. \n\nNeed to note the substance use as a significant factor. The patient's minimization might indicate denial or protective stance. \n\nPutting this into clinical terms, avoid speculation. Focus on the direct answers given.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n   - **Mild anhedonia** (Q1) and **intermittent dysphoric mood** (Q2) reported with self-attenuated severity.  \n   - **Irritability** and **emotional lability** (Q3) with minimization of significance.  \n   - **Substance use (alcohol)** as a coping mechanism for anxiety (Q6, Q8) and potential **disrupted sleep hygiene** (Q4).  \n   - **Episodic anxiety/panic symptoms** (Q6, Q7) with self-reported effective avoidance strategies (Q8).  \n   - **Non-specific somatic complaints** (Q9, Q10) with perceived misalignment between patient experience and medical reassurance.  \n\n2. **Patterns in Responses:**  \n   - **Minimization of distress** (\"not a big deal,\" \"handling things,\" \"common sense\"), suggesting potential underreporting or protective self-presentation.  \n   - **External attribution** of symptoms to stress, environment, or others (e.g., \"everyone has bad days,\" \"doctors tell me to relax\").  \n   - **Defensive tone** regarding risks (Q5, Q8, Q10) and avoidance of elaboration on certain topics (Q5).  \n\n3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n   - **Mood dysregulation** with features of **depressive symptoms** and possible **subthreshold bipolar spectrum traits** (Q3, Q4, Q5: irritability, high energy, increased risk-taking).  \n   - **Substance use disorder** risk (alcohol misuse for anxiety management and possible impaired sleep regulation).  \n   - **Functional impairment** hinted at via fatigue and irritability impacting daily functioning (Q1, Q3, Q4.  \n\n4. **Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n   - **Alcohol dependence** as a maladaptive coping strategy, potentially exacerbating anxiety/mood symptoms (Q6, Q8.  \n   - **Risky behaviors** (Q5) warrant further exploration for impulsivity or disinhibition.  \n   - **Somatization** (Q9, Q10) may reflect unaddressed psychological distress.  \n   - **Lack of insight** into symptom severity despite functional impairment (e.g., \"still get things done\").  \n\n5. **Clinical Summary:**  \n   The patient exhibits **mild to moderate depressive symptoms** (anhedonia, intermittent hopelessness), **anxiety/panic** managed via alcohol, and **emerging risk behaviors** (Q5) suggestive of dysregulated affect. Patterns of **minimization, external attribution, and substance use** indicate potential underreported distress and an **avoidant coping style**. Concerns include **substance misuse** as a comorbidity, possible **bipolar disorder screening criteria** (e.g., elevated mood/risk-taking), and **somatization** linked to psychological stress. Further assessment is needed to evaluate **mood stability, substance use patterns, and suicidal ideation history** (Q11: no active intent but acknowledgment of existential distress).

The primary diagnosis could be <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol) with <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety management</sym> as key factors. \n\nAlso, the irritability and energy with risk-taking might suggest a mixed mood state, but not enough for bipolar. \n\nThe final diagnosis should be: \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <sym>risk of bipolar spectrum features</sym>.  \n\nWait, but does the MDD criteria are met? The DSM-5 requires at least 5 symptoms for MDD. The patient has anhedonia (Q1) and depressed mood (Q2), \"feeling down\"), which is two symptoms. Not enough for full MDD, so maybe adjustment disorder? \n\nAlternatively, <med>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> as primary. \n\nAlternatively, if the alcohol use is the main driver, the primary diagnosis could be <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety</med> and depressive symptoms. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder requires at least 2-3 criteria. The patient's alcohol use to cope with anxiety (Q6, Q8) and continued use despite problems (e.g., avoiding situations when drinking) could meet 2+ criteria. \n\nSo the main diagnosis would be <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (mild to moderate severity based on responses), and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (maybe generalized) plus depressive symptoms not meeting full MDD criteria, so <med>Adjustment Disorder with Anxious-Mixed Disturbance</med>. But I need to structure this properly.\n\nAlternatively,",

For instance, the patient's responses on substance use, risk-taking behaviors, and somatic symptoms were not thoroughly probed. The therapist covered depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep, and energy but could have asked more follow-up questions, especially regarding the patient's alcohol use and its impact on daily life. Questions about psychotic symptoms, dissociation, and personality functioning were not directly addressed.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were moments of slight inaccuracies or vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'risky things,' the term wasn't defined, which could lead to ambiguity. Additionally, the therapist could have used more precise language when discussing symptoms like 'feeling down' and 'stress.' Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise to ensure accurate symptom capture.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies. For instance, the therapist moved quickly from discussing depressive symptoms to substance use without fully exploring the connection between the two. Additionally, some patient disclosures (e.g., 'feeling down') were not immediately followed up on. The conversation mostly maintained coherence but had a few abrupt transitions.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a comprehensive analysis of the patient's symptoms and potential diagnoses. The justification for the primary diagnoses of Mild Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder was generally sound. However, there were moments of ambiguity, such as not fully ruling out Bipolar II Disorder or explicitly linking all diagnostic considerations to specific DSM-5 criteria. The differential diagnosis was considered but could have been more thoroughly discussed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses mostly conveyed empathy and a professional tone. The conversational style was natural, and the therapist acknowledged the patient's distress. However, there were moments where the interaction felt slightly impersonal or abrupt, such as when discussing sensitive topics like substance use and suicidal ideation. More personalized and warm responses could have enhanced the therapeutic rapport."

      "predicted": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by reading through the patient's answers again to make sure I don't miss anything. The user provided a structured response to the DSM-5 questionnaire, and I need to analyze each question and answer carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Q1 and Q2, the patient mentions some days without pleasure and feeling down, but they downplay it as stress. That makes me think maybe mild depression symptoms, but not severe enough yet. The patient says they still get things done, so functional impairment isn't obvious, but the presence of some anhedonia and low mood is there.\n\nThen Q3: irritability. They acknowledge being snappier but dismiss it as normal. Could be part of a mood disorder. Q4 talks about sleeping less but having lots of energy. That's interesting because it's a mix of insomnia and high energy, which might point towards hypomanic episodes, especially when combined with the risky behaviors in Q5. The patient mentions risky projects and vague risky activities, which they avoid discussing directly. That plus the high energy could hint at bipolar II or substance-induced mania. \n\nSubstance use is a big red flag here. They use alcohol to manage anxiety (Q6, Q7) and mentions drinking late, which might indicate substance use disorder. The DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder require evaluating patterns of use leading to impairment. Their use of alcohol to self-medicate panic (Q6, Q7) is a concern, and avoiding situations when drinking (Q8) hints at possible social impairment. \n\nThe somatic symptoms (Q9, Q10) with back pain and feeling dismissed by doctors might suggest somatic symptom disorder, but the patient's dismissal of it and focus on stress makes me think it's more related to anxiety or depression. However, the DSM-5 requires excessive thoughts/behaviors around symptoms for SSD, and the patient's answers don't clearly meet that. So maybe that's less likely.\n\nThey denied self-harm (Q11) which is good, but the existential stress mentioned could still be part of a mood disorder.\n\nPutting this all together: The key points are the combination of depressive symptoms, possible hypomanic features, and substance use. The patient's use of alcohol to cope with anxiety and their risky behaviors point towards a potential bipolar spectrum disorder or a substance use disorder complicating an underlying mood disorder. The substance use might be masking or exacerbating symptoms, so it's important to assess for <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> and consider a mixed presentation.\n\nI need to make sure not to assume without evidence. Since they have some manic symptoms (insomnia+energy, risk-taking) and depressive symptoms, maybe a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with atypical features, or a <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> in partial remission. But without a full manic episode, it's tricky. Also, the alcohol use could be complicating things, so <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> is a strong contender here.\n\nWait, the DSM-5 combines substance abuse and dependence into <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, and they have at least two criteria (using to cope with anxiety, risky situations), so that's a possibility. The depressive symptoms are mild but present, so maybe a dual diagnosis.\n\nAlternatively, the patient's pattern of minimizing and externalizing could suggest some level of denial, common in substance use disorders. The somatic symptoms might be secondary to stress or anxiety rather than SSD, since they don't have excessive preoccupation with them beyond \"doctors said it's fine.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the primary concerns are:  \n- Possible <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood</med>, given the context of stress and transient symptoms.  \n- <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> with anxiolytic misuse and potential impairment.  \n- <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> given the nervousness and panic attacks managed via substance use.  \n- Risk for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> due to hypomania indicators (elevated energy with risk-taking, but not clearly meeting full criteria), warranting further assessment.  \n\nThe diagnosis should prioritize the most impairing conditions first. Since the substance use is impacting mood and anxiety, and the mood symptoms aren't severe enough for bipolar, maybe start with <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>, with monitoring for bipolar features. Also, the somatic symptoms don't meet SSD criteria yet, so maybe not needed here.\n\nWait, but the patient mentioned \"back aches\" and feeling like illnesses aren't taken seriously. The DSM-5 SSD requires excessive thoughts or behaviors related to symptoms, which they didn't state clearly. They say doctors said it's fine, so maybe not SSD. More likely, their somatic complaints are stress-related.\n\nSo the main issues: depression, anxiety, substance use.\n\n**Diagnosis:** The primary concerns are likely <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (alcohol) exacerbating symptoms, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>). The risk of <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> requires further evaluation due to elevated mood/risk-taking.\n\nBut need to check DSM-5 criteria. For Alcohol Use Disorder, two criteria would be: using in larger amounts/longer time (if applicable?), craving, continued use despite problems (like social avoidance?), but the answers mention using to cope, and avoiding crowds when drinking. Maybe meets 2+ criteria. \n\nThe depressive symptoms don't meet full MDD criteria yet (only 2 weeks, maybe not enough symptoms for full diagnosis). Since it's a two-week period, maybe <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Disturbance</med> is more accurate if triggered by stressors. But the answers don't specify stressors.\n\nAlternatively, the mood and substance use are intertwined. The key is to not overreach but note the possibilities.\n\nThe structured assessment requires a primary diagnosis. Since the patient's depressive symptoms are mild but present, along with substance use and anxiety, perhaps the leading diagnosis would be <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (mild) with co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>. But need to check if the symptoms align.\n\nAlternatively, the mixed symptoms of high energy with risk-taking (Q4, Q5) plus depressive elements could hint at <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> in a hypomanic phase, but without a full episode, it's a risk factor. \n\nWait, hypomania requires at least 4 days of elevated mood with 3 criteria, which they may not meet. So not sure yet. \n\nThe key points to include in the assessment are the substance use, possible mood dysregulation, and anxiety. \n\nPutting it all together, the diagnosis should reflect the most prominent issues. Since they're using alcohol to cope, and there's some depressive and anxiety symptoms, the primary diagnosis might be <med>Substance-Induced Mood Disorder</med>, but that's if the symptoms are directly due to substance use. However, if the mood symptoms predate or are separate, it's comorbid.\n\nAlternatively, given the DSM-5 criteria, perhaps <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (mild) with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Mild Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> if symptoms have been there for a longer period. But since the time frame is two weeks, maybe adjustment disorder.\n\nHmm, tricky. The DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure might not capture all criteria, so this is based on limited data. The primary diagnosis could be <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol) with <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety management</sym> as key factors. \n\nAlso, the irritability and energy with risk-taking might suggest a mixed mood state, but not enough for bipolar. \n\nThe final diagnosis should be: \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mild Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <sym>risk of bipolar spectrum features</sym>.  \n\nWait, but does the MDD criteria are met? The DSM-5 requires at least 5 symptoms for MDD. The patient has anhedonia (Q1) and depressed mood (Q2), \"feeling down\"), which is two symptoms. Not enough for full MDD, so maybe adjustment disorder? \n\nAlternatively, <med>Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, with <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> as primary. \n\nAlternatively, if the alcohol use is the main driver, the primary diagnosis could be <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety</med> and depressive symptoms. \n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder requires at least 2-3 criteria. The patient's alcohol use to cope with anxiety (Q6, Q8) and continued use despite problems (e.g., avoiding situations when drinking) could meet 2+ criteria. \n\nSo the main diagnosis would be <med>Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (mild to moderate severity based on responses), and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (maybe generalized) plus depressive symptoms not meeting full MDD criteria, so <med>Adjustment Disorder with Anxious-Mixed Disturbance</med>.
