The patient mentioned feeling anxious in social situations, so I should acknowledge that with empathy. \n\nNext, the diagnosis. The symptoms align with social anxiety. Let me check the DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder. The patient's lack of interest in social activities, feeling down when facing social events, and the context-specific irritability and sleep issues all fit. Need to ensure I don't mention Somatic Symptom Disorder unless warranted, but the sleep issues are tied to anxiety, not somatic focus.\n\nFor the reasoning, I should connect each symptom to the diagnosis. The situational nature of symptoms points away from generalized disorders. The patient's self-reported anxiety as the root cause supports the social anxiety angle.\n\nTreatment steps: CBT is the first-line for social anxiety. Maybe recommend relaxation techniques for the insomnia. Screening for depression is important since they feel down in social contexts. Collaborative care with a therapist makes sense. I need to list these clearly.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? The patient's answers don't mention trauma, so trauma-related disorders are less likely. The somatic symptoms are tied to anxiety, so SSD doesn't fit. Adjustment disorder is possible, but the focus on social interactions leans more towards social anxiety. \n\nI need to ensure the structure is exactly as specified. Check the tags: medical terms like Social Anxiety Disorder in <med>, symptoms like insomnia in <sym>, and quotes. Make sure each section is properly formatted without extra spaces. Alright, putting it all together now.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Little interest in social activities</sym>, <sym>socially triggered dysphoria</sym>, and <sym>sleep disruption</sym> were described in the context of social anticipation. Your responses highlight a pattern of distress tied to interpersonal obligations, yet you continue to engage in solitary activities that bring you comfort. This courage to navigate these challenges while acknowledging the toll it takes is significant.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** Social Anxiety Disorder, Provisional  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s symptoms align closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> as per DSM-5 criteria:  \n- <sym>anhedonia</sym> in social contexts but preserved interest in solitary activities,  \n- <sym>negative affect</sym> (depressed mood, irritability) triggered by anticipated social interactions, and  \n- <sym>avoidance-related behaviors</sym> (e.g., reduced social engagement).  \nThere is no evidence of pervasive mood or trauma-related symptoms outside social contexts. The <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> correlate with anticipatory anxiety rather than primary sleep pathology.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety via exposure-based exercises and cognitive restructuring for social fears.  \n2. **Mindfulness-based stress reduction:** To address <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> and improve coping with <sym>sleep disruption</sym>.  \n3. **Collaborative care:**  \n   - Monitor for comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> if symptoms persist beyond social triggers.  \n   - Rule out <med>Adjustment Disorder</med> if stressors are time-limited.  \n4. **Sleep hygiene intervention:** Address <sym>insomnia</sym> tied to social anticipation through structured pre-sleep routines.  \n\nA provisional diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> is supported by the pattern of distress being reliably tied to social demands. Further assessment of functional impact and symptom triggers will refine this formulation.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided the patient's responses to the first five questions of the DSM-5 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. My job is to analyze these and structure the clinical summary as requested.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main symptoms from the answers. The patient mentions losing interest in social activities, feeling depressed when thinking about social situations, irritability related to changes in plans, and sleep disturbances before meetings. These all point towards possible depression or anxiety, maybe social anxiety?\n\nLooking for patterns, the patient's symptoms seem to be triggered by social interactions. They enjoy solitary activities but struggle with social scenarios. The responses also show a tendency to downplay the severity\u2014like saying \"not really angry\" but acknowledging irritability. They mention anxiety as the root, which might explain the irritability and depression in social contexts.\n\nPotential clinical areas: Social anxiety disorder comes to mind. The sleep issues linked to anticipation of social events could be part of an anxiety response. There's also a possible depressive component, but it's context-specific. Need to note that the depressive feelings aren't constant but tied to social stressors.\n\nRisk factors: The patient is nervous and might be avoiding social interactions, which could lead to isolation. The statement about pushing through the knot in the stomach suggests they're managing it, but maybe not effectively. There's no mention of suicidal ideation here, so maybe low risk there, but ongoing stress could be an issue.\n\nIn terms of clinical significance, the key points are the social anxiety triggers, context-specific depressive symptoms, and sleep disruption related to social stress. The pattern of symptoms tied to social situations is important, as well as their acknowledgment of anxiety as a root cause. The patient's self-report of managing through might indicate coping mechanisms that could be either adaptive or maladaptive, but we don't have enough info yet.\n\nI need to make sure not to speculate. Stick to what's reported. So in the summary, I'll list the symptoms, note the pattern of social triggers, possible anxiety and depressive symptoms, sleep issues tied to social events, and the patient's awareness of anxiety as a cause. Potential areas could include social anxiety, adjustment disorder, or maybe generalized anxiety with social triggers. Risk factors would be the social withdrawal and sleep disturbances as stress indicators.\n\nWait, the user specified avoiding speculation, so maybe stick to observed data. The summary should be concise, using clinical terms like anhedonia (though partial, since they do enjoy solitary activities), dysphoric mood, irritability, sleep disturbance. The context is crucial here\u2014symptoms are situationally bound to social interactions, which points to social anxiety rather than a general disorder.\n\nAlso, note that the patient is somewhat hesitant (their initial response shows nervousness) but trying to be honest. The answers are specific, so that's a good sign. Need to highlight that the symptoms are not pervasive but tied to social contexts. The lack of energy post-sleep issues might indicate some fatigue from anxiety.\n\nOkay, putting this all together into the required sections: main symptoms, patterns, clinical areas, risks, and the summary. Make sure it's in professional language without adding anything beyond the provided info.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n---\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anhedonia (social context):** Reduced interest/pleasure in social activities, but preserved interest in solitary hobbies.  \n- **Situational dysphoria:** Depressed mood and hopelessness specifically associated with anticipatory social interactions.  \n- **Irritability:** Mild, triggered by perceived disruptions to plans (e.g., last-minute changes).  \n- **Sleep disturbance:** Insomnia and next-day fatigue linked to anticipation of social obligations (e.g., meetings).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Symptoms are **socially context-bound**, intensifying when considering or engaging in interpersonal interactions.  \n- Patient distinguishes between internal distress (e.g., \"knot in stomach\") and external behavior (\"push through\"), suggesting effortful coping.  \n- Denies severe anger but acknowledges anxiety as a primary driver of irritability.  \n- Self-reported symptoms are **moderate in frequency** (e.g., \"a few days,\" \"a couple times\").  \n\n---\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms align with fear of social situations and avoidance (loss of interest in social activities).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Context-specific worry (e.g., social obligations) and somatic symptoms (anxiety described as a \"knot in the stomach\").  \n- **Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood:** Distress may be reactive to social stressors, though chronicity is unclear.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social withdrawal:** Reduced participation in social activities may contribute to isolation.  \n- **Functional impairment:** Sleep disruption and irritability could impact work/interpersonal functioning (e.g., meetings).  \n- **Coping mechanisms:** \"Pushing through\" distress without stated support may indicate maladaptive strategies.  \n- No acute self-harm/suicidality reported.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**  \nThe patient reports **moderate, socially triggered symptoms** consistent with anxiety-driven distress. Key themes include:  \n- **Socially mediated anhedonia and dysphoria**, with intact interest in solitary activities.  \n- **Irritability** linked to perceived loss of control (e.g., sudden plan changes), framed as anxiety-mediated.  \n- **Insomnia and fatigue** secondary to anticipatory anxiety about social obligations.  \nSymptoms are situationally bounded, suggesting **social anxiety** as a primary focus. Further assessment is needed to evaluate anxiety severity, functional impact, and potential comorbid adjustment or mood disorders. Monitoring for escalation of avoidance or withdrawal is advised.  \n\n---  \n*Note: Observations are based on self-reported, non-pervasive symptoms. Cultural, contextual, and longitudinal factors require deeper exploration.*",

The <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> correlate with anticipatory anxiety rather than primary sleep pathology.  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Target social anxiety via exposure-based exercises and cognitive restructuring for social fears.  \n2. **Mindfulness-based stress reduction:** To address <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> and improve coping with <sym>sleep disruption</sym>.  \n3. **Collaborative care:**  \n   - Monitor for comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> if symptoms persist beyond social triggers.  \n   - Rule out <med>Adjustment Disorder</med> if stressors are time-limited.  \n4. **Sleep hygiene intervention:** Address <sym>insomnia</sym> tied to social anticipation through structured pre-sleep routines.  \n\nA provisional diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> is supported by the pattern of distress being reliably tied to social demands. Further assessment of functional impact and symptom triggers will refine this formulation.",
