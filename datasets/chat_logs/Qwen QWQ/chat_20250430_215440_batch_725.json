      "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to go through the user's responses again. Let me start by summarizing what they said.\n\nFirst, the patient mentioned fluctuating moods\u2014sometimes no interest in activities, other times feeling driven. That mix could point to bipolar. The hypomanic symptoms like reduced sleep without feeling tired, taking on too many projects, and irritability are big red flags. They also reported some days of feeling really low and hopeless, which is the depressive side. \n\nThe key points here are the swings between high and low moods. They mentioned antidepressants not working, which is important because antidepressants alone can worsen bipolar. The 36-hour work period and starting projects that fail could be hypomanic episodes with poor follow-through. \n\nI should check the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar II. Bipolar II requires at least one hypomanic and one depressive episode. The two-week timeframe might be too short for a full hypomanic episode, which needs at least four days. But maybe it's a mixed episode? The patient's answers suggest both depressive and hypomanic symptoms at the same time. \n\nWait, the patient's symptoms in the past two weeks include both low moods and hypomanic symptoms. A mixed episode could apply here. Alternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms alone meet criteria for a hypomanic episode with the depressive symptoms, that might fit Bipolar II. \n\nBut the duration might be an issue. Hypomania requires at least four days. The patient mentioned a day or two of decreased sleep but high energy. That's too short for a hypomanic episode. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, could it be Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder? But that's usually diagnosed in children. The patient is an adult. \n\nWhat else? Cyclothymia? That requires at least two years of fluctuating moods. But the two weeks here show fluctuations, so maybe it's part of a longer pattern. \n\nThe key symptoms here are the mix of depressive and hypomanic features. Since the duration might not meet full hypomanic episode criteria, maybe a Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? But they also have clear hypomanic symptoms. \n\nThe main issue is that the patient has symptoms that suggest bipolar, but the duration might not fully meet criteria. However, the pattern of symptoms is strongly pointing towards Bipolar II or Mixed Episode. \n\nThe patient's mention of ineffective antidepressant treatment without mood stabilizers is critical. That's a sign of possible misdiagnosis. \n\nPutting it all together, the most likely diagnosis here is **Bipolar II Disorder, currently in a mixed or hypomanic episode with depressive features**, though the duration might need further clarification. Alternatively, **Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder** if criteria for hypomania aren't met. Wait, but Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder is in the DSM-5 as a specifier. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 has Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (depressive episode with 3+ manic symptoms). The patient has several manic/hypomanic symptoms. So maybe Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? \n\nWait, hypomanic symptoms: reduced need for sleep, increased activity, grandiosity (starting projects), and irritability. That's four symptoms. The duration for hypomanic episode is 4 days. The patient reported \"a day or two\" of decreased sleep but energy. If those two days were part of a longer pattern in the two weeks, maybe. \n\nAlternatively, a hypomanic episode might be in partial remission but still present. \n\nThe clinician's job is to note the symptoms and suggest further evaluation for Bipolar II or Depressive with Mixed Features. \n\nI need to structure the answer as per the user's strict formatting. \n\nFirst paragraph: compassionate summary. \n\nThen Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder? Or Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? \n\nWait, the user's answers include: \n- Depressive symptoms (little interest, low mood, hopelessness)\n- Hypomanic symptoms (decreased sleep but high energy, increased activity, irritability, grandiosity (starting projects)\n- The patient's history of antidepressant non-response, which is common in bipolar. \n\nThe question is whether the hypomanic symptoms meet the 4-day criteria. The patient mentions \"a couple days\" but also a 36-hour work period (which might have been part of a longer hypomanic phase). \n\nIf the hypomanic symptoms last at least 4 days with 3+ symptoms (they have 4: sleep, activity, irritability, grandiosity), then it's hypomanic. The depressive symptoms are present too, so possibly Bipolar II with a current mixed episode. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic phase is too short, then Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nBut given the user's instruction to follow DSM-5, I'll go with Bipolar II Disorder, possibly with a Mixed Features specifier. \n\nWait, but the patient might not yet meet full criteria. Maybe a provisional diagnosis. \n\nThe user also mentioned the DSM info about DMDD vs ODD and Bipolar. The question mentioned that DMDD is a childhood disorder, so not applicable here. \n\n**Final Diagnosis Decision:**  \nProvisional diagnosis is **Bipolar II Disorder** with **Mixed Features Specifier**, pending further evaluation. Alternatively, if hypomania duration is insufficient, **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nBut the key symptoms align more with bipolar. \n\nNow, structuring the answer according to the user's format. Need to ensure tags are correct. \n\nDouble-checking DSM-5: Hypomanic episode requires at least four days with three or more symptoms (including elevated mood, increased activity, etc.). The patient's answers include: decreased need for sleep, more activity, irritability, and grandiosity (starting projects). That's four symptoms but only a couple days. So maybe it's a subthreshold hypomanic episode but with depressive features. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best call here is Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (DSM-5) if the hypomanic symptoms don't reach the duration. But the user's instruction says to base it on the given data. \n\nAlternatively, the symptoms described may meet the criteria for a mixed episode. \n\nWait, in Bipolar II, the patient must have had a hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode. If the hypomanic episode hasn't been fully met in the past two weeks but there's a history of such episodes. \n\nThe user's data is only for two weeks. Maybe the patient has a history of hypomania, but the current episode is mixed. \n\nGiven the data provided, the best fit is **Bipolar II Disorder with Current Mixed Episode**. But duration needs to be clarified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a provisional diagnosis of **Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS)** pending more data. \n\nAlternatively, **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nThe key is aligning with DSM-5. \n\nThe user's instructions say not to include raw references, but the provided info on DMDD and Bipolar says that DMDD is a childhood disorder, so not applicable here. The key is that the patient's symptoms include both depressive and hypomanic features, so the mixed features specifier is applicable. \n\nFinal decision: **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features** as the primary diagnosis, with further evaluation for Bipolar II. \n\nWait, but the hypomanic symptoms are present. If they meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode, then Bipolar II. The patient's sleep disturbances and increased activity might meet hypomanic criteria even if duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms are less than 4 days, but the depressive episode meets criteria, then the mixed features specifier applies. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe DSM-5's Mixed Features Specifier for depressive episodes requires 3 or more manic/hypomanic symptoms (not meeting full hypomanic criteria). The patient has at least 3: decreased need for sleep, increased activity, grandiosity (starting projects), and irritability (another). So that could qualify for the mixed feature specifier. \n\nThus, the diagnosis would be **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms meet the full criteria, then Bipolar II. \n\nSince the duration for hypomania is 4 days, the patient mentions only a couple days. But the 36-hour work period might have been part of a longer hypomanic phase. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest provisional diagnosis here would be **Bipolar II Disorder** but note the uncertainty about duration. Alternatively, \"Mixed Features\" specifier on the depression. \n\nThe user's instructions say to base it on the info given. Since the patient mentions periods of high energy and starting projects, which are classic hypomanic symptoms, perhaps the diagnosis is **Bipolar II Disorder**, with the understanding that a full evaluation is needed. \n\nThe key is to note the mixed features and the potential for bipolar. \n\nOkay, structuring the response now as per the user's format. \n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar II Disorder with Mixed Features (provisional pending duration verification)  \nWait, no, the official terms. \n\nWait, in DSM-5, \"Mixed Features\" can be added as a specifier to depressive or manic episodes. So if the patient has a current depressive episode with hypomanic features, it's Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nAlternatively, if they meet hypomanic criteria, then Bipolar II with a mixed episode. \n\nGiven the data, the safest provisional is: \n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar II Disorder (provisional) with Mixed Features Specifier  \n\nBut the exact terms are important. \n\nAlternatively, the official terms would be: \n\nEither: \n\n- **Diagnosis:**",

        "stats": {
          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through the patient's answers question by question to pick up on the main symptoms they're reporting. \n\nFirst, for question 2 about little interest or pleasure, the patient says it's mixed, with some days not feeling motivated but others having energy. That seems inconsistent, which might be important. \n\nThen question 3 on feeling down, they mention low days worse in the morning but with some high days. The mention of mornings makes me think about possible morning low mood, which sometimes is seen in depression, but the variability is notable. \n\nQuestion 4 asks about sleeping less but still having energy. The patient mentions a 36-hour work period but in the last two weeks, maybe a day or two. Also, they mention sleeping only 4 hours and feeling fine. That could be a sign of hypomania, especially if they have increased energy without needing sleep.\n\nQuestion 5 is about starting lots of projects or risky behaviors. They talk about a new fitness routine and a side hustle that failed. They downplay it as ambitious, but starting multiple projects and taking on too much might indicate hypomanic symptoms.\n\nQuestion 6 on anxiety: they report 3-4 days of feeling nervous, anxious, with physical symptoms like heart racing. So some days of anxiety, which could be part of an anxiety disorder or related to mood fluctuations.\n\nQuestion 8 about avoiding anxiety-inducing situations: they don't usually avoid, which is a point, but when they're down, they might avoid social events. That could link to depressive episodes.\n\nQuestion 10: physical aches and pains when stressed, which is common in anxiety or depression. They associate it with work stress, so maybe somatic symptoms related to stress.\n\nQuestion 11 is important: the patient feels their previous doctor only addressed the depressive aspects (prescribed antidepressants) but missed the energetic or hypomanic episodes. This suggests a possible misdiagnosis, perhaps bipolar disorder instead of unipolar depression.\n\nLooking at patterns, there's fluctuation between low and high moods. The mix of depressive symptoms (low energy, loss of interest) with periods of high energy, decreased sleep without fatigue, increased goal-directed activity (starting projects), and irritability might point towards a Bipolar II or Cyclothymic disorder. The patient also mentions that the previous treatment (antidepressants) didn't work, which is a red flag because antidepressants can sometimes exacerbate bipolar symptoms if not properly managed.\n\nPotential clinical areas: depressive episodes, possible hypomanic episodes, anxiety symptoms, and somatic complaints. The key here is the mixed presentation of both depressive and hypomanic symptoms. They might be experiencing episodes that fit the criteria for bipolar disorder. Also, the lack of avoidance behavior except during low days is a pattern to note.\n\nRisk factors include the initial misdiagnosis and treatment with antidepressants without mood stabilizers, which could be risky if they have bipolar disorder. The patient's history of starting projects that fizzle out might indicate poor follow-through during hypomanic phases. The mention of not feeling heard by their previous doctor is a concern regarding treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other symptoms. The anxiety symptoms are present but intermittent, maybe linked to the stress of high-energy periods. The sleep disturbances on fewer hours without feeling tired is a classic hypomanic symptom. The irritability and anger outbursts (like snapping at the boss) could be part of the hypomanic episodes too. \n\nPutting this together, the main concern is the possibility of a bipolar spectrum disorder. The DSM-5 criteria for hypomanic episodes include elevated mood, increased activity, racing thoughts, but some of these might be present here. The patient's symptoms cross into both depressive and hypomanic symptoms, so a mixed episode or rapid cycling might be a consideration, though the timeframe is only two weeks. However, the patient's history might have longer periods. \n\nAlso, the patient's self-reported energy despite little sleep and high activity levels with decreased need for sleep are key indicators. The previous antidepressant treatment not working could be linked to the bipolar aspect, as monotherapy with antidepressants can be problematic here. \n\nClinical significance points would include mood swings between depressive and hypomanic symptoms, possible misdiagnosis leading to ineffective treatment, and the need for a thorough bipolar disorder evaluation. The patient's mention of feeling their issues were not fully addressed before is critical for current treatment planning.\n\nI should also note the anxiety symptoms but make sure to connect the main concern to the mood fluctuations. The physical symptoms are likely stress-related but could be part of the anxiety or mood episodes. \n\nRisk factors include the potential for mood episodes to worsen without proper treatment, possible misuse of substances (they didn't mention that, though), or development of a full manic episode. The irritability and anger might also point to potential interpersonal issues or other stressors.\n\nSo summarizing, the main symptoms are mixed depressive and hypomanic features, fluctuating over the two weeks. The pattern is cyclical, with periods of low and high moods. The key areas to address are bipolar disorder evaluation, possible treatment adjustment, and addressing any anxiety symptoms that are present. The patient's history of ineffective treatment due to misdiagnosis is a significant clinical concern. Need to highlight these points in the summary without assuming but pointing out the indicators.\n</think>\n\n**Clinical Observation Summary**  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Mixed affective symptoms**: Fluctuating self-reported mood states (low energy/apathy alternating with elevated drive, increased goal-directed activity, and decreased need for sleep).  \n- **Hypomanic features**: Reduced sleep without fatigue, increased activity (e.g., starting projects, side hustles), irritability, and grandiosity (e.g., \"ambitious\" undertakings).  \n- **Depressive symptoms**: Episodic anhedonia, low mood, and morning worsening.  \n- **Anxiety symptoms**: Intermittent nervousness, physiological arousal (elevated heart rate), and somatic complaints (aches/pains linked to stress).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Biphasic mood fluctuations**: Alternation between low-energy/anhedonic days and high-energy, goal-driven days over the past two weeks.  \n- **Inconsistent symptom reporting**: Qualified answers (e.g., \"maybe a couple days,\" \"not like I used to\"), suggesting potential underreporting or uncertainty about symptom severity.  \n- **Cognitive dissonance**: Downplaying risky behaviors (e.g., 36-hour work binges, failed projects) as \"ambition,\" possibly masking hypomanic behavior.  \n\n**3. Potential Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Bipolar Spectrum Disorder**: Symptoms align with hypomanic episodes (elevated mood, increased activity, reduced need for sleep) alongside depressive symptoms, raising concern for **Bipolar II Disorder** or **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder**.  \n- **Inadequate prior treatment**: Previous antidepressant prescription without mood stabilizers may have exacerbated cyclical symptoms.  \n- **Somatization**: Physical symptoms (aches, headaches) appear stress- or mood-related, warranting further assessment.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Unrecognized hypomania**: History of untreated hypomanic episodes may increase risk for progression to full manic episodes or treatment-resistant depression.  \n- **Impulsivity/risk-taking**: Unplanned projects and working 36-hour shifts suggest potential for impaired judgment during elevated phases.  \n- **Medication non-response**: Ineffective prior antidepressant treatment may reflect misdiagnosis.  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient presents with a mixed clinical picture of fluctuating mood states, including episodic anhedonia, low energy, and morning dysphoria, alongside hypomanic features (e.g., reduced sleep need, increased goal-directed activity, irritability). Reports of episodic anxiety and somatic symptoms linked to stress suggest comorbid anxiety or somatic symptom disorder. The patient\u2019s history of ineffective antidepressant treatment (without mood stabilizers) and underreported hypomanic symptoms raise diagnostic concerns for a **Bipolar II Disorder** or **Mixed Features specifier**. Risk factors include potential treatment misalignment and impaired functioning during hypomanic phases. A thorough mood disorder evaluation, including mood charting, longitudinal symptom pattern review, and differential diagnosis for bipolar spectrum disorders, is clinically indicated.",

Or Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? \n\nWait, the user's answers include: \n- Depressive symptoms (little interest, low mood, hopelessness)\n- Hypomanic symptoms (decreased sleep but high energy, increased activity, irritability, grandiosity (starting projects)\n- The patient's history of antidepressant non-response, which is common in bipolar. \n\nThe question is whether the hypomanic symptoms meet the 4-day criteria. The patient mentions \"a couple days\" but also a 36-hour work period (which might have been part of a longer hypomanic phase). \n\nIf the hypomanic symptoms last at least 4 days with 3+ symptoms (they have 4: sleep, activity, irritability, grandiosity), then it's hypomanic. The depressive symptoms are present too, so possibly Bipolar II with a current mixed episode. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic phase is too short, then Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nBut given the user's instruction to follow DSM-5, I'll go with Bipolar II Disorder, possibly with a Mixed Features specifier. \n\nWait, but the patient might not yet meet full criteria. Maybe a provisional diagnosis. \n\nThe user also mentioned the DSM info about DMDD vs ODD and Bipolar. The question mentioned that DMDD is a childhood disorder, so not applicable here. \n\n**Final Diagnosis Decision:**  \nProvisional diagnosis is **Bipolar II Disorder** with **Mixed Features Specifier**, pending further evaluation. Alternatively, if hypomania duration is insufficient, **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nBut the key symptoms align more with bipolar. \n\nNow, structuring the answer according to the user's format. Need to ensure tags are correct. \n\nDouble-checking DSM-5: Hypomanic episode requires at least four days with three or more symptoms (including elevated mood, increased activity, etc.). The patient's answers include: decreased need for sleep, more activity, irritability, and grandiosity (starting projects). That's four symptoms but only a couple days. So maybe it's a subthreshold hypomanic episode but with depressive features. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best call here is Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (DSM-5) if the hypomanic symptoms don't reach the duration. But the user's instruction says to base it on the given data. \n\nAlternatively, the symptoms described may meet the criteria for a mixed episode. \n\nWait, in Bipolar II, the patient must have had a hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode. If the hypomanic episode hasn't been fully met in the past two weeks but there's a history of such episodes. \n\nThe user's data is only for two weeks. Maybe the patient has a history of hypomania, but the current episode is mixed. \n\nGiven the data provided, the best fit is **Bipolar II Disorder with Current Mixed Episode**. But duration needs to be clarified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a provisional diagnosis of **Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS)** pending more data. \n\nAlternatively, **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nThe key is aligning with DSM-5. \n\nThe user's instructions say not to include raw references, but the provided info on DMDD and Bipolar says that DMDD is a childhood disorder, so not applicable here. The key is that the patient's symptoms include both depressive and hypomanic features, so the mixed features specifier is applicable. \n\nFinal decision: **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features** as the primary diagnosis, with further evaluation for Bipolar II. \n\nWait, but the hypomanic symptoms are present. If they meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode, then Bipolar II. The patient's sleep disturbances and increased activity might meet hypomanic criteria even if duration is short. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms are less than 4 days, but the depressive episode meets criteria, then the mixed features specifier applies. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe DSM-5's Mixed Features Specifier for depressive episodes requires 3 or more manic/hypomanic symptoms (not meeting full hypomanic criteria). The patient has at least 3: decreased need for sleep, increased activity, grandiosity (starting projects), and irritability (another). So that could qualify for the mixed feature specifier. \n\nThus, the diagnosis would be **Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features**. \n\nAlternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms meet the full criteria, then Bipolar II. \n\nSince the duration for hypomania is 4 days, the patient mentions only a couple days. But the 36-hour work period might have been part of a longer hypomanic phase. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest provisional diagnosis here would be **Bipolar II Disorder** but note the uncertainty about duration. Alternatively, \"Mixed Features\" specifier on the depression. \n\nThe user's instructions say to base it on the info given. Since the patient mentions periods of high energy and starting projects, which are classic hypomanic symptoms, perhaps the diagnosis is **Bipolar II Disorder**, with the understanding that a full evaluation is needed. \n\nThe key is to note the mixed features and the potential for bipolar. \n\nOkay, structuring the response now as per the user's format. \n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar II Disorder with Mixed Features (provisional pending duration verification)  \nWait, no, the official terms. \n\nWait, in DSM-5, \"Mixed Features\" can be added as a specifier to depressive or manic episodes. So if the patient has a current depressive episode with hypomanic features, it's Major Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features. \n\nAlternatively, if they meet hypomanic criteria, then Bipolar II with a mixed episode. \n\nGiven the data, the safest provisional is: \n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar II Disorder (provisional) with Mixed Features Specifier  \n\nBut the exact terms are important. \n\nAlternatively, the official terms would be: \n\nEither: \n\n- **Diagnosis:**",

Let me start by summarizing what they said.\n\nFirst, the patient mentioned fluctuating moods\u2014sometimes no interest in activities, other times feeling driven. That mix could point to bipolar. The hypomanic symptoms like reduced sleep without feeling tired, taking on too many projects, and irritability are big red flags. They also reported some days of feeling really low and hopeless, which is the depressive side. \n\nThe key points here are the swings between high and low moods. They mentioned antidepressants not working, which is important because antidepressants alone can worsen bipolar. The 36-hour work period and starting projects that fail could be hypomanic episodes with poor follow-through. \n\nI should check the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar II. Bipolar II requires at least one hypomanic and one depressive episode. The two-week timeframe might be too short for a full hypomanic episode, which needs at least four days. But maybe it's a mixed episode? The patient's answers suggest both depressive and hypomanic symptoms at the same time. \n\nWait, the patient's symptoms in the past two weeks include both low moods and hypomanic symptoms. A mixed episode could apply here. Alternatively, if the hypomanic symptoms alone meet criteria for a hypomanic episode with the depressive symptoms, that might fit Bipolar II. \n\nBut the duration might be an issue. Hypomania requires at least four days. The patient mentioned a day or two of decreased sleep but high energy. That's too short for a hypomanic episode. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, could it be Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder? But that's usually diagnosed in children. The patient is an adult. \n\nWhat else? Cyclothymia? That requires at least two years of fluctuating moods. But the two weeks here show fluctuations, so maybe it's part of a longer pattern. \n\nThe key symptoms here are the mix of depressive and hypomanic features. Since the duration might not meet full hypomanic episode criteria, maybe a Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? But they also have clear hypomanic symptoms. \n\nThe main issue is that the patient has symptoms that suggest bipolar, but the duration might not fully meet criteria. However, the pattern of symptoms is strongly pointing towards Bipolar II or Mixed Episode. \n\nThe patient's mention of ineffective antidepressant treatment without mood stabilizers is critical. That's a sign of possible misdiagnosis. \n\nPutting it all together, the most likely diagnosis here is **Bipolar II Disorder, currently in a mixed or hypomanic episode with depressive features**, though the duration might need further clarification. Alternatively, **Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder** if criteria for hypomania aren't met. Wait, but Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder is in the DSM-5 as a specifier. \n\nWait, the DSM-5 has Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features (depressive episode with 3+ manic symptoms). The patient has several manic/hypomanic symptoms. So maybe Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? \n\nWait, hypomanic symptoms: reduced need for sleep, increased activity, grandiosity (starting projects), and irritability. That's four symptoms. The duration for hypomanic episode is 4 days. The patient reported \"a day or two\" of decreased sleep but energy. If those two days were part of a longer pattern in the two weeks, maybe. \n\nAlternatively, a hypomanic episode might be in partial remission but still present. \n\nThe clinician's job is to note the symptoms and suggest further evaluation for Bipolar II or Depressive with Mixed Features. \n\nI need to structure the answer as per the user's strict formatting. \n\nFirst paragraph: compassionate summary. \n\nThen Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder? Or Depressive Disorder with Mixed Features? \n\nWait, the user's answers include: \n- Depressive symptoms (little interest, low mood, hopelessness)\n- Hypomanic symptoms (decreased sleep but high energy, increased activity, irritability, grandiosity (starting projects)\n- The patient's history of antidepressant non-response, which is common in bipolar. \n\nThe question is whether the hypomanic symptoms meet the 4-day criteria. The patient mentions \"a couple days\" but also a 36-hour work period (which might have been part of a longer hypomanic phase). \n\nIf the hypomanic symptoms last at least 4 days with 3+ symptoms (they have 4: sleep, activity, irritability, grandiosity), then it's hypomanic.
