      "content": "\n<think>\nAlright, let me start by addressing the user's request. They want a structured mental health assessment based on the provided questionnaire responses. The user emphasized following a strict format with specific sections and tags. \n\nFirst, I need to ensure the response starts with a compassionate summary. I must highlight empathy while summarizing the key points from the answers. The patient mentioned feeling numb in social situations, anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance. I should acknowledge their struggles without jargon, showing understanding.\n\nNext, the Diagnosis section requires a specific condition. Looking at the responses, the strong indicators are social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The panic symptoms in social contexts (panic attacks, avoidance) align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med>. The pervasive nervousness and worry suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood) aren't severe enough for MDD yet. Need to check if Somatic Symptom Disorder applies, but the aches seem stress-related, so maybe not the primary issue.\n\nFor the Reasoning section, I need to link symptoms to the diagnoses. The panic in social situations and avoidance point to SAD. The generalized anxiety and hyperarousal (nervousness, restlessness) fit GAD. The lack of bipolar features (no hypomania) and absence of psychotic symptoms rule those out. The somatic symptoms are secondary to anxiety, so no SCD. \n\nTreatment steps should be practical. CBT is first-line for anxiety disorders. SSRIs like sertraline are common. Addressing social isolation with support groups. Educate on panic management techniques. Validate their experiences to counter the feeling of being dismissed. Monitor for depressive symptoms progression. \n\nI must ensure all required formatting elements are present: the four sections in order, tags for medical terms, symptoms, and quotes. Avoid markdown, use the exact headings with asterisks. Check for proper spacing between sections and no extra line breaks. Make sure the tags are correctly applied. Also, confirm that the reasoning doesn't mention bipolar or SCD unless supported. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"social anxiety and GAD\" in the example, so align with that. Ensure the diagnosis section lists both disorders. The reasoning needs to connect each symptom to the diagnoses clearly. The treatment steps should be numbered and specific. \n\nDouble-check that the instructions are followed precisely\u2014no extra text, correct tags, and structure. Make sure the summary is empathetic but concise. Alright, time to structure all that into the response without missing any elements.\n</think>\n\n<sym>Feeling overwhelmed</sym> is palpable in your responses, marked by a <sym>constant sense of dread in social situations</sym> and the exhausting cycle of avoiding what you need most: meaningful connection. Your description of <sym>panic attacks</sym> during gatherings and <sym>physical tension</sym> (like stomachaches before events) underscores how deeply your anxiety is shaping your life. The loneliness of feeling <quote>\"like my struggles aren\u2019t taken seriously\"</quote> resonates, as does the toll of sleepless nights spent ruminating.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Sual Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, provisional pending further assessment.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **SAD Diagnostic Alignment:**  \n  - <sym>Panic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, rapid heartbeat in social settings)</sym>, avoidance of social interactions, and fear of judgment meet SAD criteria (DSM-5, 300.22).  \n  - <sym>Psychological distress disrupts social/occupational function</sym> (e.g., skipping events, strained relationships).  \n- **GAD Features:**  \n  - Persistent <sym>nervousness, worry, and hyperarousal</sym> (e.g., daily restlessness, sleep disturbance) align with GAD (DSM-5, 300.02.  \n  - Anxiety is not better explained by panic disorder alone, as it extends to broader contexts like work/study demands.  \n- **Excluded Conditions:**  \n  - <med>Major Depression</med> criteria not fully met (anhedonia/hopelessness are mild and intermittent).  \n  - No <sym>psychotic features</sym> (denies hallucinations/paranoia), ruling out <med>Schizophrenia spectrum</med>. Somatic symptoms appear anxiety-mediated rather than primary focus (e.g., no excessive preoccupation with illness).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for <med>SAD</med>:** Target social anxiety via exposure therapy (gradual social reengagement) and cognitive restructuring of self-critical thoughts.  \n2. **SSRI Augmentation:** Trial of low-dose sertraline (50\u2013100 mg/day) to address both <med>SAD</med> and <med>GAD</med> symptoms, with 4\u20136 weeks to assess efficacy.  \n3. **Social Skills Training:** Group therapy to rebuild confidence in navigating social interactions.  \n4. **Panic Management Training:** Breathing techniques and grounding exercises to mitigate <sym>panic attacks</sym> during anxiety triggers.  \n5. **Collateral Validation:** Address perceptions of <quote>\"not being taken seriously\"</quote> by validating symptoms in session and discussing strategies to communicate needs to loved ones.  \n6. **Monitoring:** Track depressive symptom severity weekly to rule out progression to <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.  \n\nAvoid <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> labeling unless follow-up confirms disproportionate illness-related preoccupation. Prioritize addressingsing the anxiety cycle first.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: \n<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the patient's responses to the DSM-5 self-assessment questions. Let me start by reading through all the answers again to get a clear picture.\n\nFirst, the patient mentioned little interest or pleasure in things, feeling numb or detached even in social situations. That's a classic sign of anhedonia, which is common in depression. But then, when asked about feeling down, they said it's several days a week. So there's some depressive symptoms, but maybe not every day. \n\nThe patient doesn't report much irritability, which is interesting because sometimes depression can come with irritability, but here the patient is more anxious. They denied having lots of energy despite not sleeping well, which is more like bipolar, but they actually feel exhausted, so that's more in line with anxiety or depression.\n\nThe key points here are the anxiety symptoms. The patient reports feeling nervous, anxious, on edge nearly every day (Q7) and panic symptoms like racing heart and dizziness in crowds (Q8). They also avoid situations that cause anxiety (Q9), which points to social anxiety disorder. The physical symptoms like stomach aches and headaches (Q10) are likely somatic symptoms of anxiety. \n\nThey also mention that others don't take their issues seriously (Q11), which could indicate a sense of invalidation, possibly leading to worsening symptoms. Sleep disturbances (Q15) are present, which is common in anxiety and depression, but the patient's main issue seems to be the anxiety-related avoidance and panic.\n\nThere's no mention of self-harm (Q12) or psychosis (Q13, Q14), so that's a relief. The patient isn't at risk in that aspect. \n\nLooking at patterns, the patient's responses consistently highlight social anxiety and generalized anxiety, with physical manifestations. The avoidance behaviors are significant, affecting their daily life. \n\nPotential clinical areas would be social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and possibly major depressive disorder (MDD) but the depressive symptoms aren't as severe as the anxiety. The avoidance and panic attacks align more with social anxiety. \n\nRisk factors? Well, the avoidance is impacting their life, leading to social withdrawal. The unaddressed anxiety might lead to increased isolation. The patient's concern that their condition isn't taken seriously by others could exacerbate their symptoms.\n\nPutting this into clinical terms: The main symptoms are anhedonia, low mood, significant anxiety with somatic symptoms, panic attacks in social situations, and avoidance behaviors. The patterns show a clear pattern of social anxiety and GAD. The clinical significance points to possible social anxiety disorder and GAD. No immediate risk factors like self-harm, but the impact on functioning is notable.\n</think>\n\n### Clinical Observation Summary  \n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \n- **Anhedonia/Depressed Mood:** Reports diminished interest/pleasure in activities (Q2) and intermittent feelings of sadness/hopelessness (Q3).  \n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Marked nervousness, worry, and feeling \"on edge\" daily (Q7), panic attacks (e.g., dizziness, heart palpitations in social settings; Q8).  \n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** Systematic avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (e.g., social events, meetings; Q9), leading to significant impairment in social functioning.  \n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained aches/pains (e.g., stomachaches, headaches; Q10) linked to stress.  \n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Insomnia with poor sleep quality due to racing thoughts (Q15).  \n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**  \n- **Dominance of Anxiety:** Symptoms cluster around generalized anxiety (Q7, Q8, Q10) and social anxiety (Q8, Q9, Q14).  \n- **Functional Impairment:** Avoidance behaviors and somatic symptoms significantly disrupt daily functioning and social engagement.  \n- **Validation Concerns:** Reports perceived invalidation of symptoms by others (Q11), suggesting potential under-recognition of distress.  \n- **Lack of Bipolar Features:** Denies hypomanic symptoms (e.g., increased energy, excessive goal-directed activity; Q5, Q6).  \n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD):** Pronounced social phobia with physiological panic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, heart palpitations) and avoidance (Q8\u2013Q9).  \n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent restlessness, feeling \"on edge,\" and excessive worry (Q7).  \n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Mild anhedonia and low mood (Q2\u2013Q3), though symptom severity may not yet meet full criteria.  \n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Somatic complaints (Q10) may reflect anxiety exacerbation rather than primary somatic focus.  \n\n**4. Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- **Social Withdrawal:** Avoidance behaviors risk further isolation and functional decline.  \n- **Perceived Stigma:** Reports of invalidation by others (Q11) may worsen coping efforts.  \n- **No Acute Risk:** No suicidal ideation (Q12) or psychotic symptoms (Q13\u2013Q14).  \n\n**5. Summary (Clinical Language):**  \nThe patient demonstrates clinically significant symptoms of **generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** and **social anxiety disorder (SAD)**, with prominent features of physiological hyperarousal (e.g., panic symptoms in social contexts, somatic complaints), avoidance behaviors, and impaired social functioning. Mild depressive symptoms (anhedonia, low mood) are present but may not yet meet full criteria for a major depressive disorder. No psychosis or self-harm risk detected. The patient\u2019s perceived invalidation by others (Q11) may contribute to treatment resistance or under-treatment. Further assessment is warranted to evaluate diagnostic thresholds for GAD/SAD, comorbid depression, and to explore the impact of avoidance on quality of life. A stepped care approach including CBT for anxiety and social support reinforcement is indicated.",

      "predicted": "<sym>Feeling overwhelmed</sym> is palpable in your responses, marked by a <sym>constant sense of dread in social situations</sym> and the exhausting cycle of avoiding what you need most: meaningful connection. Your description of <sym>panic attacks</sym> during gatherings and <sym>physical tension</sym> (like stomachaches before events) underscores how deeply your anxiety is shaping your life. The loneliness of feeling <quote>\"like my struggles aren\u2019t taken seriously\"</quote> resonates, as does the toll of sleepless nights spent ruminating.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Sual Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, provisional pending further assessment.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **SAD Diagnostic Alignment:**  \n  - <sym>Panic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, rapid heartbeat in social settings)</sym>, avoidance of social interactions, and fear of judgment meet SAD criteria (DSM-5, 300.22).  \n  - <sym>Psychological distress disrupts social/occupational function</sym> (e.g., skipping events, strained relationships).  \n- **GAD Features:**  \n  - Persistent <sym>nervousness, worry, and hyperarousal</sym> (e.g., daily restlessness, sleep disturbance) align with GAD (DSM-5, 300.02.  \n  - Anxiety is not better explained by panic disorder alone, as it extends to broader contexts like work/study demands.  \n- **Excluded Conditions:**  \n  - <med>Major Depression</med> criteria not fully met (anhedonia/hopelessness are mild and intermittent).  \n  - No <sym>psychotic features</sym> (denies hallucinations/paranoia), ruling out <med>Schizophrenia spectrum</med>. Somatic symptoms appear anxiety-mediated rather than primary focus (e.g., no excessive preoccupation with illness).  \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for <med>SAD</med>:** Target social anxiety via exposure therapy (gradual social reengagement) and cognitive restructuring of self-critical thoughts.  \n2. **SSRI Augmentation:** Trial of low-dose sertraline (50\u2013100 mg/day) to address both <med>SAD</med> and <med>GAD</med> symptoms, with 4\u20136 weeks to assess efficacy.  \n3. **Social Skills Training:** Group therapy to rebuild confidence in navigating social interactions.  \n4. **Panic Management Training:** Breathing techniques and grounding exercises to mitigate <sym>panic attacks</sym> during anxiety triggers.  \n5. **Collateral Validation:** Address perceptions of <quote>\"not being taken seriously\"</quote> by validating symptoms in session and discussing strategies to communicate needs to loved ones.  \n6. **Monitoring:** Track depressive symptom severity weekly to rule out progression to <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.  \n\nAvoid <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> labeling unless follow-up confirms disproportionate illness-related preoccupation. Prioritize addressingsing the anxiety cycle first.",
