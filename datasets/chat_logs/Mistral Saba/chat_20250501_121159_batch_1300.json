The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of detachment are significant, suggesting a dissociative component. The use of alcohol for sleep management is a concerning pattern that requires monitoring. Further diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning should focus on addressing the trauma, managing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and addressing sleep disturbances. Referral to a trauma-focused therapist and potential pharmacotherapy for PTSD and depression may be necessary. The patient\u2019s history of an accident and the anniversary of that event indicate a clear precipitating factor for the current symptoms.",

You've also shared that you feel disconnected from yourself and others, and you've been using <sym>alcohol</sym> to help you sleep. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> related to a traumatic event. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The use of <sym>alcohol</sym> to manage <sym>sleep</sym> is a notable concern but does not yet meet criteria for a <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <med>Trauma-focused therapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)</med>, to address the <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to manage <med>depression</med> symptoms and improve coping strategies.\n3. <med>Pharmacotherapy</med> consultation to discuss the possibility of <med>anti-depressants</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medications</med> to help manage symptoms.\n4. Referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>insomnia</sym> and provide evidence-based treatment options.\n5.
