You've mentioned a profound loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and a notable lack of energy and motivation. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've expressed worries about the future and withdrawn from your usual social interactions. You've also mentioned occasional thoughts of harming yourself, which is deeply concerning. It's clear that you're experiencing significant emotional and cognitive challenges, and I'm here to help you navigate through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation is marked by persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, all of which are key symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of hurting oneself</sym> further support this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>mania or hypomania</sym> symptoms and the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> for more than two weeks align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's <sym>withdrawal from social activities</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support a depressive presentation. While the patient reports some <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, they do not meet the criteria for a separate <med>anxiety disorder</med> diagnosis given the predominance of <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, intent, and plan to ensure the patient's immediate safety. This may involve referring the patient to a higher level of care if necessary.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. <med>Interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> or <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> may also be beneficial.\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> if symptoms are severe or if the patient has a history of <med>depressive episodes</med> that responded to medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often a first-line treatment.\n4. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym>, treatment adherence, and safety. Adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress.\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient and their support system with information about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, its treatment options, and coping strategies to empower them in managing the condition.\n6. **Collaborative Care:** Involve the patient's primary care provider and any other relevant healthcare professionals to ensure a coordinated approach to treatment. This may include addressing any <sym>medical issues</sym> that could be contributing to or exacerbating <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n7. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep schedule to support overall mental health.",

Key symptoms include persistent sadness, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and thoughts of self-harm. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of detachment further support a depressive presentation. Immediate attention is required to assess the severity of suicidal ideation and to develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Further diagnostic evaluation, including a clinical interview and possibly additional assessments, is recommended to clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of suicidal ideation, intent, and plan.\n- **Therapeutic Intervention:** Initiate evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and, if indicated, pharmacological intervention.\n- **Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment adherence, and safety.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "I hear that you've been feeling quite distressed lately. You've mentioned a profound loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and a notable lack of energy and motivation. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've expressed worries about the future and withdrawn from your usual social interactions. You've also mentioned occasional thoughts of harming yourself, which is deeply concerning. It's clear that you're experiencing significant emotional and cognitive challenges, and I'm here to help you navigate through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation is marked by persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, all of which are key symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of hurting oneself</sym> further support this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>mania or hypomania</sym> symptoms and the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> for more than two weeks align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's <sym>withdrawal from social activities</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support a depressive presentation. While the patient reports some <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, they do not meet the criteria for a separate <med>anxiety disorder</med> diagnosis given the predominance of <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, intent, and plan to ensure the patient's immediate safety. This may involve referring the patient to a higher level of care if necessary.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. <med>Interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> or <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> may also be beneficial.\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> if symptoms are severe or if the patient has a history of <med>depressive episodes</med> that responded to medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often a first-line treatment.\n4. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym>, treatment adherence, and safety. Adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress.\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient and their support system with information about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, its treatment options, and coping strategies to empower them in managing the condition.\n6. **Collaborative Care:** Involve the patient's primary care provider and any other relevant healthcare professionals to ensure a coordinated approach to treatment. This may include addressing any <sym>medical issues</sym> that could be contributing to or exacerbating <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n7. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep schedule to support overall mental health.",
