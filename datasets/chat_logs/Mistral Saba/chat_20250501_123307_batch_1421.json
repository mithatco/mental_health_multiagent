I'm here to support you and explore these feelings together.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The patient reports feeling down or hopeless almost every day and has lost interest in previously enjoyed activities. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive decline</sym> (memory problems), <sym>somatoform symptoms</sym> (headaches, stomach pain), and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. The patient's occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not acted upon, further supports the diagnosis. The criteria for MDD are met based on the patient's report of five or more symptoms over the past two weeks, with at least one of the symptoms being either <sym>depressed mood</sym> or <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) to address depressive symptoms and develop coping strategies.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss the potential benefits of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce early morning awakenings.\n4. **Cognitive Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to evaluate the extent of memory problems and rule out other potential causes.\n5. **Suicide Safety Plan:** Develop a <med>suicide safety plan</med> with the patient to ensure their immediate safety and provide resources for support in case of crisis.\n6. **Follow-up Appointments:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n7. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social supports, such as friends and family, and consider support groups for individuals with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n8. **Health Education:** Provide education on <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> to help the patient understand their condition and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.",

It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, feeling persistently sad and losing interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned difficulties with sleep, memory, and feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're taking the first step to seek help. I'm here to support you and explore these feelings together.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The patient reports feeling down or hopeless almost every day and has lost interest in previously enjoyed activities. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive decline</sym> (memory problems), <sym>somatoform symptoms</sym> (headaches, stomach pain), and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. The patient's occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not acted upon, further supports the diagnosis. The criteria for MDD are met based on the patient's report of five or more symptoms over the past two weeks, with at least one of the symptoms being either <sym>depressed mood</sym> or <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) to address depressive symptoms and develop coping strategies.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss the potential benefits of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce early morning awakenings.\n4. **Cognitive Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to evaluate the extent of memory problems and rule out other potential causes.\n5. **Suicide Safety Plan:** Develop a <med>suicide safety plan</med> with the patient to ensure their immediate safety and provide resources for support in case of crisis.\n6. **Follow-up Appointments:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n7. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social supports, such as friends and family, and consider support groups for individuals with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n8. **Health Education:** Provide education on <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> to help the patient understand their condition and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.",
