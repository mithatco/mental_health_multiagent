      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a difficult time recently, feeling a sense of emptiness and hopelessness, which can be truly draining. You've mentioned experiencing <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that make it hard for you to feel truly rested. Additionally, you've expressed feeling anxious and on edge, avoiding situations that make you feel overwhelmed, and even having <sym>panic attacks</sym>. You also mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, as well as feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's clear that these experiences are impacting your daily life and overall well-being. I'm here to listen and help you navigate through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (e.g., washing hands, checking things) are consistent with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation.\n2. Consider starting <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depression</med>. This can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. Explore medication options with your psychiatrist, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, and specific OCD medications if needed.\n4. Engage in regular self-care activities such as exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve mood.\n5. Consider joining a support group or seeking therapy to address feelings of isolation and improve social connections.\n6. If <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> of self-harm persist, ensure you have a safety plan in place and contact a mental health professional immediately if needed.",
