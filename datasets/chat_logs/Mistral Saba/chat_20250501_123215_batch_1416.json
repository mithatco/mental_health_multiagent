This questionnaire will help us assess various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Your answers will be kept confidential, and this will help us create a safe and comfortable space for you to share your experiences. We will go through 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. Let's start with the first question: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two weeks? If so, could you describe how often this has happened?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n**Patient Responses and Main Symptoms:**\n\n1. **Depressed Mood and Anhedonia:**\n   - The patient reports feeling less interest or pleasure in activities they usually enjoy (Q1) and experiencing moments of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2). These symptoms are indicative of depressive symptoms.\n\n2. **Irritability and Sleep Disturbances:**\n   - Increased irritability (Q3) and difficulties with sleep (Q4, Q14) are noted, which are common symptoms in depressive disorders but can also be associated with anxiety.\n\n3. **Anxiety:**\n   - The patient describes feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, or worried (Q6) and experiencing panic or fear, particularly in social situations and in anticipation of presentations (Q7). These symptoms suggest the presence of anxiety, possibly with a social anxiety component.\n\n4. **Avoidance Behaviors:**\n   - The patient avoids situations that make them anxious (Q8), which is a common coping mechanism in anxiety disorders.\n\n5. **Physical Symptoms:**\n   - The patient reports unexplained aches and pains, including stomach aches and headaches (Q9), which could be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\n6. **Suicidal Ideation:**\n   - The patient has had thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), which is a significant risk factor for self-harm and requires immediate attention.\n\n7. **Relationship Issues:**\n   - The patient feels distant from friends and family (Q20), indicating potential social withdrawal or interpersonal difficulties.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\n\n- The patient's responses suggest a pattern of depressive symptoms with a significant anxiety component, particularly in social situations.\n- There is a recurring theme of avoidance and withdrawal from social and potentially stressful situations.\n- The patient reports physical symptoms that may be related to stress or anxiety.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n1. **Mood Disorders:**\n   - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a primary consideration given the reported symptoms of anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation.\n\n2. **Anxiety Disorders:**\n   - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are also significant areas to explore, given the patient's reports of excessive worry, panic symptoms, and avoidance behaviors.\n\n3. **Suicidal Ideation:**\n   - The presence of suicidal ideation is a critical concern that necessitates immediate risk assessment and management.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11) is a severe risk factor that requires immediate attention and intervention.\n- The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal (Q8, Q20) may indicate a deteriorating social support system, which could exacerbate psychological distress.\n\n**Summary in Clinical Language:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with a mood disorder, specifically Major Depressive Disorder, with significant comorbid anxiety, particularly social anxiety. Key symptoms include anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation. The patient also exhibits avoidance behaviors and reports physical symptoms that may be related to psychological distress. The presence of suicidal ideation necessitates an immediate risk assessment and intervention. Further evaluation is required to explore the patient's relationship issues and the extent of their social withdrawal. The patient does not report substance use disorders or significant cognitive impairments. The overall clinical picture suggests a need for a comprehensive mental health assessment and a tailored treatment plan addressing both depressive and anxiety symptoms.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed 20 out of 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Most domains were thoroughly explored, including mood, anger, anxiety, sleep problems, and suicidal ideation. However, the therapist could have probed deeper into some areas, such as cognitive function and repetitive thoughts/behaviors, which were somewhat addressed but not as thoroughly as others. The domains of psychotic symptoms and substance use were directly asked but could have been explored with more follow-up questions. Overall, the coverage was comprehensive but not exhaustive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria and were clinically relevant. The questions were phrased in a way that targeted specific clinical symptoms, such as anhedonia, depressed mood, and anxiety. However, there were a few instances where the language could have been more precise or where follow-up questions could have further clarified the patient's experiences. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have explored the frequency and intensity of these thoughts more deeply.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. The therapist effectively navigated transitions between different DSM-5 domains. However, there were a few moments where the conversation could have benefited from more probing or where tangential topics were briefly touched upon. For instance, when discussing sleep disturbances, the therapist could have explored the impact on daily functioning more thoroughly.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Provisional Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which included anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation. The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to the DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety disorders. The reasoning provided was comprehensive, and the differential diagnosis was considered, ruling out other potential diagnoses such as Somatic Symptom Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style throughout the interaction. Responses were personalized, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. The therapist effectively balanced clinical inquiry with emotional support, creating a safe and non-judgmental space for the patient to share their concerns."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the conversation demonstrated a strong clinical approach, effectively covering most DSM-5 domains and justifying the diagnosis with clear links to patient symptoms. The therapist showed empathy and maintained a professional tone. Areas for improvement include deeper exploration of a few domains and more precise follow-up questions in certain areas. The conversation was well-structured, and the therapist provided a clear plan for next steps and treatment options.",

      "predicted": "I want to acknowledge the <sym>challenges</sym> you've been facing. It sounds like you've been feeling <sym>less interested</sym> in activities you usually enjoy, experiencing moments of feeling <sym>down</sym>, and having <sym>troubles with sleep</sym>. You've also shared that you've been feeling <sym>more irritable</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and even had <sym>thoughts of hurting yourself</sym>, which must be incredibly difficult to manage. It's clear that you've been <sym>avoiding</sym> situations that make you <sym>anxious</sym>, and you've felt <sym>distant from friends and family</sym>. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences, and I'm here to support you in finding a path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis: Provisional Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is particularly concerning and warrants immediate attention. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support the diagnosis of an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> could be considered due to the presence of <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, the primary symptoms and functional impairment point more towards <med>MDD</med> with comorbid <med>anxiety</med>. The patient does not report <sym>psychotic features</sym> or <sym>substance use</sym> that would warrant a different diagnosis. The diagnosis is provisional due to the potential for symptoms to evolve or change over time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Risk Assessment:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough <med>risk assessment</med> to determine the immediate risk of self-harm and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n3. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic medication</med> to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies for improving <med>sleep hygiene</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family and consider <med>support groups</med> or <med>group therapy</med> to reduce <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve social functioning.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and any <med>adverse effects</med> of medication.",
