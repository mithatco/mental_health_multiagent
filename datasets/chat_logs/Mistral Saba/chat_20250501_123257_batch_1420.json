      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time, feeling <sym>down and hopeless</sym> most of the day, with little to no interest in things you used to enjoy. It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance behaviors, which can be incredibly frightening and isolating. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, which can be a very disorienting experience. Your <sym>sleep</sym> has been affected, with both <sym>excessive sleep</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, and you've also mentioned some <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches. Additionally, you've withdrawn from social relationships, which can make these feelings even more intense. It's understandable that you're feeling <quote>like a burden</quote> and that your symptoms aren't being taken seriously. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these feelings, and I'm here to help you navigate this together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with potential comorbid <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>excessive sleep</sym>. These symptoms align with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sever anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's description of feeling <sym>detached from themselves and their surroundings</sym> suggests potential <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can be comorbid with anxiety and depressive disorders. The patient's symptoms are not better explained by another medical condition, and there is no evidence of <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> or <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Given the severity and complexity of these symptoms, a provisional diagnosis is warranted to guide treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Mental Health Evaluation:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with a mental health professional for a thorough assessment, including a clinical interview and possible use of standardized assessment tools.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to help manage and treat <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. This approach can help the patient identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication. Medication can be a helpful adjunct to therapy in managing severe <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Teach and encourage the use of mindfulness and relaxation techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage reconnection with social support systems, such as friends and family. Support groups for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> can also be beneficial.\n6. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n7. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
