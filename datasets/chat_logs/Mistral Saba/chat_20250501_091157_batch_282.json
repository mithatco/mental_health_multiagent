Additionally, the patient exhibits depressive symptoms, such as anhedonia and depressed mood, and reports sleep disturbances, which are likely exacerbated by anxiety. The patient's intrusive thoughts and repetitive mental checking behaviors suggest cognitive distortions that may contribute to their overall distress. The patient's avoidance of social situations and sleep disturbances pose potential risks for further exacerbation of symptoms and social isolation. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on addressing social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and cognitive distortions, with an emphasis on improving sleep quality and social engagement.",

It's clear that social situations have been particularly difficult for you, leading to avoidance behaviors and a sense of detachment. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and it's important to recognize that seeking support is a significant step towards improvement.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (with depressive features)\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of significant <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, <sym>avoidance behavior</sym>, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> during social events are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about being judged, <sym>repetitive mental checking</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> exacerbated by anxiety suggest a comorbid component of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym> indicate the presence of depressive features, which may warrant further evaluation for a potential <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Implement CBT techniques to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> related to social situations. This can include exposure therapy, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation techniques.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient for an evaluation with a psychiatrist or primary care physician to discuss the possibility of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and depressive symptoms.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This can include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Teach mindfulness practices, such as <med>mindfulness meditation</med> or <med>deep breathing exercises</med>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>detachment feelings</sym>.\n5. **Gradual Exposure to Social Situations:** Develop a structured plan to gradually expose the patient to social situations in a controlled manner, with a focus on building confidence and reducing avoidance behaviors.\n6. **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and improve <sym>social connections</sym>.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
