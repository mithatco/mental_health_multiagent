This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and identify any areas that might need further exploration. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and you'll let me know how much each issue has bothered you in the past two weeks. Let's begin with the first question."

You've described a significant loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, persistent feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, and a noticeable increase in irritability. <Sym>Sleep disturbances</sym> have been challenging, with early morning awakenings and trouble falling back asleep. You've also mentioned <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> throughout your body, which seem to add to your overall discomfort. Additionally, you've had thoughts of harming yourself, though you've clarified that you don't have a specific plan. <Sym>Memory issues</sym> and feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings have also been troubling you. You've pulled away from friends and family, feeling a sense of loss and uncertainty about your identity and life goals.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent, Severe) with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms such as <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which suggest the presence of <med>Anxious Distress</med>. The patient's <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> could be related to the <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, and do not necessarily warrant a separate <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> diagnosis at this time. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> are likely manifestations of the underlying <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a psychiatrist for a thorough evaluation and consideration of <med>medication</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>.\n2. Referral to a <med>psychotherapist</med> for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n4. Collaborative care with the patient's primary care physician to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may contribute to <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or meditation.\n6. Establish a <med>safety plan</med> with the patient to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety.",
