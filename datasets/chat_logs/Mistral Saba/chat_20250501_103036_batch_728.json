The patient's report of suicidal ideation warrants careful monitoring and immediate intervention. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of detachment further underscore the need for comprehensive support and intervention. A thorough clinical evaluation, including a mental status examination and possibly a neuropsychological assessment, is recommended to develop an appropriate treatment plan. This plan should address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a focus on improving sleep quality, cognitive function, and social reintegration.",
