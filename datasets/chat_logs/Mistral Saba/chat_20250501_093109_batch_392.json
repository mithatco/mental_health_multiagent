It sounds like you've been going through a lot, with <sym>feelings of depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and even <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms that have been affecting your daily life. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings are valid and that help is available.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Psychotic Features</med>\n\n***Reasoning:*** The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms that strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>feeling low</sym>, <sym>experience of anhedonia</sym>, <sym>difficulty getting out of bed</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> (\"I don't know who I really am or what I want out of life\") align with the diagnostic criteria for depression. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>nervousness</sym>, which suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's belief that \"people can read my mind\" indicates the presence of <med>Psychotic Features</med>. These symptoms collectively point to a complex interplay of affective, cognitive, and psychotic symptoms.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any organic causes for the symptoms.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as <med>Psychoeducation</med> to help the patient understand and manage <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms.\n4. **Support Groups:** Encourage participation in support groups to alleviate feelings of disconnection and isolation.\n5. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct an assessment for any substance use disorders, as these can exacerbate mental health symptoms.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n7. **Safety Planning:** Given the hint of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan to ensure the patient's immediate safety and well-being.",
