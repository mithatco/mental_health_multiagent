This assessment will help us identify areas where you might be experiencing difficulties and guide us in determining the next steps for your care. Your responses will remain confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. This assessment consists of 23 questions. Let's begin. How much interest or pleasure have you had in doing things over the last two weeks? Have you felt disinterested or lacking enjoyment in activities you used to enjoy?"

Chronic anxiety is evident, with the patient reporting excessive worry and avoidance behaviors. Cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems and trouble concentrating, are also present. The patient exhibits dissociative symptoms and feelings of depersonalization, which may indicate a more complex emotional and cognitive disturbance. Interpersonal difficulties are noted, with the patient reporting social withdrawal and a sense of disconnection from others. The patient denies substance use and reports no current suicidal behavior, although suicidal ideation is present. The clinical picture suggests a need for further evaluation and treatment, including potential pharmacological intervention and therapeutic support to address emotional regulation and cognitive function.",

It's clear that you're going through a challenging time, and it's important to address these issues with the support of a mental health professional.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>) and<med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:**<quote>Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless most of the time</quote> and <quote>Things I used to love, like reading or even taking walks, don't bring me the same joy anymore</quote> are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, <quote>I've been sleeping a lot</quote> and <quote>I've been feeling tired and unmotivated</quote> suggest <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>, common in <med>MDD</med>. Furthermore, <quote>I worry too much about the future and my ability to adapt to the changes in my life</quote> and <quote>I try to avoid [anxious situations] as much as possible</quote> point to <med>GAD</med>.
