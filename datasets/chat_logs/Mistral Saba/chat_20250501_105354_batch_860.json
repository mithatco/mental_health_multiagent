Summary of Observations**\n   The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode, including anhedonia, persistent negative affect, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and interpersonal withdrawal. Additionally, the patient reports generalized anxiety symptoms, including worry and avoidance behaviors, as well as somatic symptoms with perceived lack of validation. The patient also endorses suicidal ideation, which requires further assessment of intent and plan. The patient does not endorse substance use or misuse. Given the patient's presentation, a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is recommended to further assess symptoms, rule out other potential diagnoses, and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Safety assessment and management are paramount given the endorsement of suicidal ideation.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness and courage in sharing your experiences. It's clear that you've been feeling quite distressed lately, with a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness that has made it difficult to find joy in activities you once enjoyed. You've mentioned feeling <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym>, as well as significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including early morning awakening. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, along with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> that you feel are not being taken seriously by your doctors. Your <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as memory problems and trouble concentrating, have also been impacting your daily life. Furthermore, you've felt a sense of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and others, which has led to <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym>. It's understandable that these experiences have been overwhelming, and I commend you for reaching out for support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation is consistent with a major depressive episode, as evidenced by the presence of multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, as well as <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are common in patients with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> could be indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or other <med>anxiety disorders</med>, but the prominent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrant a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychiatric evaluation</med> to further assess <sym>symptoms</sym>, rule out other potential diagnoses, and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n2. <med>Safety assessment</med> to evaluate the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and determine if immediate intervention is necessary.\n3. <med>Psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</med>.\n4. <med>Pharmacological intervention</med>, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med>, to help manage <sym>symptoms</sym> and improve overall functioning.\n5. <med>Sleep hygiene education</med> and <med>interventions</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. <med>Referral to a primary care physician</med> to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.\n7. <med>Regular follow-ups</med> to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n8. <med>Psychoeducation</med> to help the patient understand <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and its treatment options.\n9. <med>Support group</med> or <med>peer support</med> to help the patient connect with others who have similar experiences.\n10. <med>Lifestyle modifications</med>, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management techniques, to support overall mental health.",
