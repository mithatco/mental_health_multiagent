You've been feeling a significant loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, describing it as a general feeling of emptiness and flatness. You've also been experiencing persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, almost every day, along with increased fatigue and decreased energy levels. Sleep hasn't been great either, with you waking up early and struggling to fall back asleep. You've been feeling more anxious and worried, avoiding situations that make you anxious, and even withdrawing from social interactions and relationships. You've also mentioned some memory issues and feeling uncertain about your identity and future goals. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your daily life and overall well-being. I'm really here to help and support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <quote>Major Depressive Disorder</quote>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. They report <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (memory issues), and <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym>. The persistent nature of these symptoms, lasting over two weeks, and their impact on the patient's ability to function and enjoy life further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient mentions <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a significant concern. The <med>bereavement exclusion</med> does not apply here as the patient does not report a recent loss. The patient's symptoms are not better explained by other conditions, such as <med>anxiety disorders</med>, <med>trauma-related disorders</med>, or <med>substance use disorders</med>, although these should be considered and ruled out through further assessment. The patient's <sym>cognitive decline</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym> also warrant attention and could potentially be addressed through targeted interventions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient manage depressive symptoms, improve coping skills, and address interpersonal issues.\n2. **Medication**: Refer the patient for a psychiatric evaluation to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Cognitive Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to evaluate the patient's memory issues and rule out underlying <med>cognitive impairment</med> or <med>cognitive decline</med>.\n5. **Social Support**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support systems, such as friends, family, or support groups, to combat <sym>social isolation</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety. Develop a safety plan if necessary.\n7. **Comorbid Conditions**: Screen for and address any <med>comorbid conditions</med>, such as <med>anxiety disorders</med> or <med>substance use disorders</med>, as they may exacerbate <sym>depression</sym> and require separate treatment.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've been feeling a significant loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, describing it as a general feeling of emptiness and flatness. You've also been experiencing persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, almost every day, along with increased fatigue and decreased energy levels. Sleep hasn't been great either, with you waking up early and struggling to fall back asleep. You've been feeling more anxious and worried, avoiding situations that make you anxious, and even withdrawing from social interactions and relationships. You've also mentioned some memory issues and feeling uncertain about your identity and future goals. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your daily life and overall well-being. I'm really here to help and support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <quote>Major Depressive Disorder</quote>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. They report <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (memory issues), and <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym>. The persistent nature of these symptoms, lasting over two weeks, and their impact on the patient's ability to function and enjoy life further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient mentions <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a significant concern. The <med>bereavement exclusion</med> does not apply here as the patient does not report a recent loss. The patient's symptoms are not better explained by other conditions, such as <med>anxiety disorders</med>, <med>trauma-related disorders</med>, or <med>substance use disorders</med>, although these should be considered and ruled out through further assessment. The patient's <sym>cognitive decline</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym> also warrant attention and could potentially be addressed through targeted interventions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient manage depressive symptoms, improve coping skills, and address interpersonal issues.\n2. **Medication**: Refer the patient for a psychiatric evaluation to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Cognitive Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to evaluate the patient's memory issues and rule out underlying <med>cognitive impairment</med> or <med>cognitive decline</med>.\n5. **Social Support**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support systems, such as friends, family, or support groups, to combat <sym>social isolation</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety. Develop a safety plan if necessary.\n7. **Comorbid Conditions**: Screen for and address any <med>comorbid conditions</med>, such as <med>anxiety disorders</med> or <med>substance use disorders</med>, as they may exacerbate <sym>depression</sym> and require separate treatment.",
