You mentioned that you don't get the same joy from activities you used to enjoy, and you've been feeling down and irritable. You've also been sleeping a lot and feeling anxious and on edge, especially when you run out of whatever you're using. You've had some thoughts of hurting yourself, which is really concerning, and you've been feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including feeling on edge, experiencing panic, and avoiding situations that make them anxious, suggest a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The patient's misuse of painkillers for stress and sleep management indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support the diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, as these can be associated with severe depressive episodes. The patient's reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behavior</sym> also align with these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a Psychiatrist:** To conduct a comprehensive evaluation and consider <med>pharmacological treatment</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med>, to manage the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To address the <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, as well as to develop healthier <sym>coping mechanisms</sym> instead of relying on painkillers.\n3. **Substance Use Evaluation:** To assess the extent of painkiller misuse and develop a <med>substance use disorder treatment plan</med>.\n4. **Suicide Prevention Plan:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to develop a <med>safety plan</med> and ensure the patient has a support system in place. This may include regular check-ins, emergency contact numbers, and identifying a safe person to reach out to in times of crisis.\n5. **Referral to a Sleep Specialist:** To address the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and improve overall <sym>sleep quality</sym>, which is important for managing both <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage reconnecting with friends and family, or joining support groups to combat feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.",

You mentioned that you don't get the same joy from activities you used to enjoy, and you've been feeling down and irritable. You've also been sleeping a lot and feeling anxious and on edge, especially when you run out of whatever you're using. You've had some thoughts of hurting yourself, which is really concerning, and you've been feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including feeling on edge, experiencing panic, and avoiding situations that make them anxious, suggest a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The patient's misuse of painkillers for stress and sleep management indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support the diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, as these can be associated with severe depressive episodes. The patient's reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behavior</sym> also align with these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a Psychiatrist:** To conduct a comprehensive evaluation and consider <med>pharmacological treatment</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med>, to manage the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To address the <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, as well as to develop healthier <sym>coping mechanisms</sym> instead of relying on painkillers.\n3. **Substance Use Evaluation:** To assess the extent of painkiller misuse and develop a <med>substance use disorder treatment plan</med>.\n4. **Suicide Prevention Plan:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to develop a <med>safety plan</med> and ensure the patient has a support system in place. This may include regular check-ins, emergency contact numbers, and identifying a safe person to reach out to in times of crisis.\n5. **Referral to a Sleep Specialist:** To address the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and improve overall <sym>sleep quality</sym>, which is important for managing both <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage reconnecting with friends and family, or joining support groups to combat feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.",
