You've also mentioned feeling anxious and on edge, with several panic attacks that have made you avoid certain situations. Additionally, you've been experiencing unexplained physical symptoms like headaches and stomach pain, along with sleep disturbances that are impacting your daily life. It's understandable that these experiences have also strained your relationships, making you feel distant from others. It's commendable that you've been open about these experiences, and I appreciate your honesty.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent feelings of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's avoidance behaviors and the impact on daily functioning further support these diagnoses. The somatic symptoms of headaches and stomach pain, along with sleep disturbances, may be related to the emotional distress. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is a consideration, the symptoms do not meet the criteria of excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors regarding physical symptoms. The patient's history of substance use is negative, ruling out <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>CBT</med> can help identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that trigger <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n2. **Medication Review:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial for managing both <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Address the strain in relationships through <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to help rebuild social connections and improve communication skills.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. If these <sym>symptoms</sym> worsen, immediate intervention is necessary.\n6. **Referral to a Sleep Specialist:** If <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> persist despite <med>sleep hygiene</med> improvements, consider a referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> for further evaluation.\n7. **Support Groups:** Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> to share experiences and coping strategies.",

      "predicted": "It is clear that you've been going through a challenging time. You've expressed feeling down and hopeless, with a noticeable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned feeling anxious and on edge, with several panic attacks that have made you avoid certain situations. Additionally, you've been experiencing unexplained physical symptoms like headaches and stomach pain, along with sleep disturbances that are impacting your daily life. It's understandable that these experiences have also strained your relationships, making you feel distant from others. It's commendable that you've been open about these experiences, and I appreciate your honesty.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent feelings of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's avoidance behaviors and the impact on daily functioning further support these diagnoses. The somatic symptoms of headaches and stomach pain, along with sleep disturbances, may be related to the emotional distress. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is a consideration, the symptoms do not meet the criteria of excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors regarding physical symptoms. The patient's history of substance use is negative, ruling out <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>CBT</med> can help identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that trigger <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n2. **Medication Review:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial for managing both <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Address the strain in relationships through <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to help rebuild social connections and improve communication skills.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. If these <sym>symptoms</sym> worsen, immediate intervention is necessary.\n6. **Referral to a Sleep Specialist:** If <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> persist despite <med>sleep hygiene</med> improvements, consider a referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> for further evaluation.\n7. **Support Groups:** Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> to share experiences and coping strategies.",
