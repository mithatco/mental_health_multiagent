Additionally, the patient reports significant anxiety, cognitive difficulties, and impulsive behaviors. The patient's occasional suicidal ideation, impulsivity, and social withdrawal require immediate attention and intervention.

While it mentions increased irritability and impulsive behavior, which could be associated with bipolar disorder, it does not explicitly identify or align with the expected profile of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and reasoning provided primarily support Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) without considering a manic or hypomanic episode, which is crucial for a bipolar diagnosis.",

The patient\u2019s increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsive behavior</sym> further support this diagnosis. While the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> with intent, the presence of any <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> is a concerning warning sign that requires careful monitoring.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. **Comprehensive Assessment:** Conduct a thorough evaluation to gather more detailed information about the patient\u2019s symptoms, medical history, and any family history of <med>mental health</med> conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with <med>MDD</med>.\n3. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n4. **Monitoring for Suicidal Ideation:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess the patient\u2019s <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety. Implement a safety plan if necessary.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive relationships and consider joining a support group for individuals experiencing <med>MDD</med>.\n6. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommend lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to support overall mental health.\n7. **Educational Resources:** Provide the patient with educational materials about <med>MDD</med> to help them understand their condition and the available treatment options.",
