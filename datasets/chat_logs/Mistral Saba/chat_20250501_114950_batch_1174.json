      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've shared that you've been feeling <sym>down and hopeless</sym> most days, and you've lost interest in things you used to enjoy. You're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> on a daily basis and having <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are quite intense. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> like feeling detached from yourself. It's clear that these struggles have taken a toll on your relationships and your sense of self. You're not alone in this, and it's important to seek help to manage these difficult <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports significant <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> are consistent with <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>wish for life to end</sym> indicates a potential risk factor. There are no clear indications of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as the <sym>physical symptoms</sym> are related to anxiety and panic attacks.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the provisional diagnosis and rule out other possible <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n\n2. Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n\n3. Consider medication management, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>, to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n4. Recommend <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>relationship difficulties</sym>.\n\n5. Provide education on <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety management techniques</sym> to empower the patient to take an active role in their treatment.\n\n6. Monitor the patient closely for any signs of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure a safety plan is in place.",
