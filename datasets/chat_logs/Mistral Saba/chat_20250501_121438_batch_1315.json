These symptoms are associated with significant impairment in functioning and distress. The patient's avoidance behaviors and somatic focus suggest a need for a multimodal treatment approach, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression, and possibly medication management. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of the cognitive and sleep disturbances and to rule out any underlying medical conditions.",
