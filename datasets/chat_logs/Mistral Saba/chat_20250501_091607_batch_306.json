You've been feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> for some time now, and it's taking a toll on your daily life. You've described a heavy feeling of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and a lack of <sym>interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritated</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, which seems to be affecting your relationships. Additionally, you're experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. It's understandable that all of this would be overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Provisional Impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with several <med>mental health conditions</med>. The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> strongly suggest a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, the <sym>constant anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> causing significant distress and the <sym>concern about not being taken seriously</sym> suggest <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> further support the complexity of the patient's mental state. The <med>provisional impression</med> is based on the <sym>symptoms</sym> presented and requires further evaluation for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</med>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and modify negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and provide recommendations for improving <med>sleep hygiene</med>.\n4. **Medical Evaluation:** Ensure a comprehensive <med>medical evaluation</med> to rule out any underlying physical conditions that may be contributing to the <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family and consider support groups for individuals experiencing similar challenges.\n6. **Safety Planning:** Develop a <med>safety plan</med> with the patient to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their immediate safety.",
