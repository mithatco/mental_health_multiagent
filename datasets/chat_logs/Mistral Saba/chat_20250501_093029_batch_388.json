It's clear that you've been dealing with significant fluctuations in your mood, ranging from periods of deep <sym>depression</sym> to times of intense <sym>mania</sym>. You've described feeling utterly hopeless during depressive episodes, which is incredibly difficult to endure. Additionally, your experiences with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, as well as the physical pain and discomfort you've been feeling, must be very taxing. It's also notable that these <sym>mood swings</sym> have impacted your sleep patterns, relationships, and overall quality of life. Your insight into these patterns and your commitment to seeking help are commendable steps towards improving your well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar Disorder (BPAD), <med>Severe</med> with <med>Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your description of alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. During depressive episodes, you experience <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, while during manic episodes, you report increased energy, <sym>irritability</sym>, and impulsive behaviors, such as starting multiple projects and making risky investments. These mood swings are accompanied by significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including <sym>hypersomnia</sym> during depression and <sym>insomnia</sym> during mania. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including persistent worry and panic attacks, are also notable and may indicate a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The severity of your symptoms, as evidenced by the impact on your daily functioning and relationships, warrants a <med>Severe</med> specifier. While you haven't reported any <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms, hallucinations, or <sym>delusional</sym> thoughts, ongoing monitoring is essential. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>bodily</sym> <sym>discomfort</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym> during depressive episodes could be related to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed to rule out underlying medical conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Psychotherapy: Consider engaging in <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med> to help manage <sym>mood swings</sym>, improve <sym>mood regulation</sym>, and address <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n2. Mood stabilizers: Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>mood stabilizer</med> medications, such as <med>lithium</med> or <med>valproic acid</med>, to help manage <sym>bipolar</sym> symptoms.\n3. Sleep hygiene: Work with a healthcare provider to develop strategies for improving <sym>sleep quality</sym> and addressing <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>hypersomnia</sym>.\n4. Anxiety management: Explore <med>anxiety management techniques</med>, such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, or additional CBT-focused interventions, to address <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n5. Interpersonal support: Engage in <med>interpersonal therapy</med> or join support groups to improve <sym>relationships</sym> and social functioning.\n6. <med>Routine physical examinations</med>: Schedule regular check-ups with a primary care physician to evaluate and monitor any <sym>physical</sym> <sym>symptoms</sym> and rule out underlying medical conditions.\n7. <med>Psychoeducation</med>: Participate in <med>psychoeducation</med> programs to learn more about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and develop coping strategies.\n8. <med>Suicide prevention planning</med>: Work with your mental health provider to develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</med> and ensure your safety.",
