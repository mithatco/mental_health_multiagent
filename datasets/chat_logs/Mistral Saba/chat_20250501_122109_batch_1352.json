      "predicted": "I appreciate your honesty and bravery in sharing your struggles. It's clear that you're experiencing significant challenges with <sym>mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep</sym> that are impacting your daily life. You've been feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a noticeable lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You're also dealing with persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are interfering with your ability to function and connect with others. It's understandable that these feelings can make you want to avoid situations that trigger your <sym>anxiety</sym>, and it's important to acknowledge the support you need to manage these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> considerations\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> point to a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> is indicated by the patient's <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>restless sleep</sym> warrant consideration of a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> in tandem with <sym>anxiety</sym> raise considerations for a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>Detachment</sym> and <sym>feelings of being lost</sym> can be considered as part of the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapeutic Interventions:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>OCD</sym> symptoms. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. Additionally, <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (ERP) can be beneficial for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n\n2. **Pharmacological Interventions:** Consider a psychiatric evaluation to discuss the potential benefits of <med>antidepressant</med> medication to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for these conditions. For <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, a <med>sleep hygiene</med> program and possibly a short-term <med>hypnotic</med> or <med>melatonin</med> supplement may be considered.\n\n3. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends and family. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> could help address <sym>interpersonal distress</sym> and improve <sym>relationship satisfaction</sym>. <med>Support groups</med> for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> can also provide a safe space to share experiences and learn coping strategies.\n\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Recommend practices such as <med>mindfulness meditation</med>, <med>deep breathing</med>, and <med>progressive muscle relaxation</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Ensure the patient feels comfortable discussing any new or worsening <sym>symptoms</sym>.",
