You've shared that you've been feeling down and hopeless most days, and you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also been struggling with <sym>sleep</sym> disturbances, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms, which have led you to avoid social situations. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>. It's also evident that you've been feeling disconnected from your relationships and your sense of self. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (unspecified), <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (OCD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, <sym>sleep</sym> disturbances, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym> attacks, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> that have been present for the past two weeks. These symptoms meet the criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym> attacks, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, also suggests an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (unspecified). The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> are consistent with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</sym>. CBT can provide strategies to manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n2. **Medication:** Consult a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications, which may help alleviate <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used for both <sym>depression</sym> and <med>OCD</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement good <sym>sleep</sym> hygiene practices to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Stress Management:** Explore stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and seek support from friends and family. Social connection can be beneficial for mental health and emotional well-being.\n6. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging concerns.",
