      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing some significant emotional challenges recently. You've mentioned feeling a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, as well as increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>. You've also expressed <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be incredibly isolating and exhausting. It's understandable that these feelings may be causing you to avoid social situations and question your identity and relationships. It's commendable that you've reached out for help, as this is an important step towards managing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are key symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> may also be related to the depressive episode. <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> could be considered, but the prominent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for evidence-based therapies such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med>. Discuss the potential benefits and side effects of different options.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Cognitive and Behavioral Strategies:** Teach the patient <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. **Substance Use Assessment:** Given the patient's report of occasional <med>alcohol use</med>, assess the level of use and provide appropriate interventions if necessary.\n6. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
