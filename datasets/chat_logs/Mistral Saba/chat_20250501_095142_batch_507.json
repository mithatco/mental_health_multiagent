These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve their mood and anxiety levels.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist for <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.

This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and addressing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through behavioral interventions.\n\n4. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to rebuild social connections and engage in previously enjoyed activities at their own pace. Support groups or individual therapy focusing on <med>interpersonal relationships</med> may be beneficial.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being. Assess for any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>psychotic features</sym> during these follow-ups.\n\n6. **Education:** Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>dissociative symptoms</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and reduce stigma.",

The therapist systematically addressed domains such as depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and others, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms.

The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, maintaining consistency with DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up appropriately on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's feelings of hopelessness and anxiety, ensuring a smooth and coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, providing a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration. The justification for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possible Dissociative Disorder was well-supported by the patient's symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You've shared some very challenging experiences lately. It's clear that you've been feeling a significant amount of <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which has been affecting your daily life and relationships. You've mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, and it sounds like you've been struggling with <sym>memory</sym> issues and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. It's also evident that you've been withdrawing from activities and people you used to enjoy, and you're feeling unsure about your identity and purpose. These feelings are valid and it's important to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD), and possible <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of <sym>generalized anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicates a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's description of feeling detached from themselves and their surroundings could suggest a <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>. The patient's symptoms significantly impact their daily functioning and quality of life, warranting further evaluation and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) to address the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve their mood and anxiety levels.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist for <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. The patient's <med>hypersomnia</med> might also benefit from a stimulant medication during the day.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and addressing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through behavioral interventions.\n\n4. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to rebuild social connections and engage in previously enjoyed activities at their own pace. Support groups or individual therapy focusing on <med>interpersonal relationships</med> may be beneficial.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being. Assess for any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>psychotic features</sym> during these follow-ups.\n\n6. **Education:** Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>dissociative symptoms</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and reduce stigma.",
