This assessment is designed to help us understand your symptoms better and ensure we're providing the best possible care. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible for you. Let's start with the first question: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

You've shared that you're experiencing a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, feeling down and hopeless, and having trouble sleeping. You've also mentioned increased irritability, anxiety, and even some psychotic-like experiences, such as hearing thoughts before they are spoken. It's clear that you've been struggling with a lot, and it's important to address these <sym>symptoms</sym> together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Anxiety Disorder (Generalized)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent lack of interest or pleasure in activities (<sym>anhedonia</sym>), feelings of depression and hopelessness (<sym>depressed mood</sym>), and increased irritability (<sym>irritability</sym>), which are all consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including racing thoughts, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's experiences of hearing thoughts before they are spoken and having intrusive thoughts warrant consideration of psychotic features, which are associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. The patient's history of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not acted upon, further supports the severity of the depressive episode and the need for careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of the depressive and psychotic symptoms, and to rule out other potential causes.\n2. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, to address both the depressive and psychotic symptoms.\n3. Refer to a therapist or counselor for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and depressive symptoms.\n4. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and the importance of adherence to treatment.\n5. Monitor the patient closely for any worsening of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or psychotic symptoms, and ensure a safety plan is in place.\n6. Consider referral to a sleep specialist if <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> persist, as they may be a symptom of an underlying sleep disorder or a side effect of medication.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. You've shared that you're experiencing a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, feeling down and hopeless, and having trouble sleeping. You've also mentioned increased irritability, anxiety, and even some psychotic-like experiences, such as hearing thoughts before they are spoken. It's clear that you've been struggling with a lot, and it's important to address these <sym>symptoms</sym> together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Anxiety Disorder (Generalized)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent lack of interest or pleasure in activities (<sym>anhedonia</sym>), feelings of depression and hopelessness (<sym>depressed mood</sym>), and increased irritability (<sym>irritability</sym>), which are all consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including racing thoughts, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's experiences of hearing thoughts before they are spoken and having intrusive thoughts warrant consideration of psychotic features, which are associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. The patient's history of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not acted upon, further supports the severity of the depressive episode and the need for careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of the depressive and psychotic symptoms, and to rule out other potential causes.\n2. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, to address both the depressive and psychotic symptoms.\n3. Refer to a therapist or counselor for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and depressive symptoms.\n4. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and the importance of adherence to treatment.\n5. Monitor the patient closely for any worsening of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or psychotic symptoms, and ensure a safety plan is in place.\n6. Consider referral to a sleep specialist if <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> persist, as they may be a symptom of an underlying sleep disorder or a side effect of medication.",
