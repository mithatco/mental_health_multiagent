You've mentioned feeling less interested in activities you once enjoyed, a persistent sense of emptiness and hopelessness, and a notable decrease in your energy levels. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life, including your sleep and social interactions. You've also noticed some cognitive changes, such as memory issues and difficulty concentrating. It's important to address these feelings and changes, and I'm here to help you find the support you need.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe patient presents with persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that have lasted for more than two weeks and have a significant impact on their daily life. These <sym>symptoms</sym> meet the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the DSM-5. The patient also reports <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, which are often associated with <med>depression</med>. While there are occasional <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, they are not the predominant features and do not meet the criteria for a primary <med>anxiety disorder</med> or <med>suicidal behavior disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>feeling numb</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> could also be indicative of a <med>dissociative disorder</med>, but the lack of other dissociative symptoms and the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> make <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> the more fitting diagnosis. Given that the symptoms have been persistent and impactful, a diagnosis of <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> (Dysthymia) is also considered, but the presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym> of sufficient severity and duration suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation to further assess the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address any risk of <med>suicidal behavior</med>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n3. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to help the patient manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n4. Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve sleep quality.\n5. Refer the patient for a <med>neuropsychological evaluation</med> to assess <sym>cognitive difficulties</med> and rule out any underlying <med>neurocognitive disorders</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep routine to support overall mental health.\n7. Monitor the patient's progress regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal outcomes.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time lately. You've mentioned feeling less interested in activities you once enjoyed, a persistent sense of emptiness and hopelessness, and a notable decrease in your energy levels. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life, including your sleep and social interactions. You've also noticed some cognitive changes, such as memory issues and difficulty concentrating. It's important to address these feelings and changes, and I'm here to help you find the support you need.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe patient presents with persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that have lasted for more than two weeks and have a significant impact on their daily life. These <sym>symptoms</sym> meet the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the DSM-5. The patient also reports <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, which are often associated with <med>depression</med>. While there are occasional <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, they are not the predominant features and do not meet the criteria for a primary <med>anxiety disorder</med> or <med>suicidal behavior disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>feeling numb</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> could also be indicative of a <med>dissociative disorder</med>, but the lack of other dissociative symptoms and the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> make <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> the more fitting diagnosis. Given that the symptoms have been persistent and impactful, a diagnosis of <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> (Dysthymia) is also considered, but the presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym> of sufficient severity and duration suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation to further assess the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address any risk of <med>suicidal behavior</med>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n3. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to help the patient manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n4. Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve sleep quality.\n5. Refer the patient for a <med>neuropsychological evaluation</med> to assess <sym>cognitive difficulties</med> and rule out any underlying <med>neurocognitive disorders</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep routine to support overall mental health.\n7. Monitor the patient's progress regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal outcomes.",
