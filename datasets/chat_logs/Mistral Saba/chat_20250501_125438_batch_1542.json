        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and others, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as thoughts of harming self, and ensured safety measures were discussed. The conversation had smooth transitions and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The diagnosis explicitly linked to DSM-5 criteria, and alternative diagnoses were considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

The therapist demonstrated a deep understanding of the patient's symptoms and effectively used this information to inform the diagnostic process. The conversation was well-structured, empathetic, and professional, making it a model for best practices in clinical assessment.",

The frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>unexplained physical discomfort</sym> and <sym>excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to somatic symptoms</sym> suggest a diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a trial of <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to manage <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, along with <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.

Provide contact information for crisis hotlines and local mental health services.\n7. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage involvement of family members or close friends in the treatment process to provide additional support and understanding.\n8. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging concerns.",
