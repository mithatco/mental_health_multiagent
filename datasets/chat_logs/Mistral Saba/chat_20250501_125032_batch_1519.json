      "predicted": "I understand that you're going through a really challenging time right now. You've been feeling a loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, and you're experiencing persistent feelings of anxiety and depression. It sounds like you're also dealing with sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and strained relationships. You've mentioned feelings of depersonalization and uncertainty about your identity, which must be very difficult to manage. It's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to share these experiences, and I'm here to support you in finding ways to cope.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and potential <obsessive-compulsive disorder>OCD</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a range of <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>cognitive disturbances</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> (quote: <quote>I\u2019ve definitely noticed that. Like, I used to love my hobbies, but now they just feel like a chore.</quote>).\nThe patient also exhibits <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms such as <sym>persistent worries</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (quote: <quote>I worry about everything\u2014work, health, you name it.</quote>), which aligns with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\nAdditionally, the patient describes <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> such as checking locks multiple times, which may indicate <med>OCD</med> features (quote: <quote>Yeah, like checking things. I check the locks on the doors a hundred times before I leave the house.</quote>).\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychoeducation**: Educate the patient about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help them understand their symptoms and the available treatments.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Refer the patient for CBT to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>OCD</sym> symptoms. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. **Medication Review**: Consult with a psychiatrist to review the patient's current medications and consider pharmacological interventions if appropriate. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> may be beneficial for both <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide guidance on improving sleep hygiene to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: Refer the patient for IPT to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and improve <sym>relationships</sym>. IPT can help the patient develop better communication skills and resolve conflicts.\n6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Teach the patient mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation, to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
