Your responses will be kept confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll be covering 23 questions, and I'll read each one aloud.

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time lately. You've described feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent depression, and increased irritability. It's clear that you've been struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which have led you to avoid certain situations. You've also mentioned some <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, <sym>perceptual distortions</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming and isolating.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with <med>psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>Things that used to interest me don't seem to bring me any joy anymore</quote>). They also exhibit <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I've been having a hard time sleeping at night</quote>), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (<quote>It's like my mind just won't shut off</quote>), and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> (<quote>I hear voices, but then again, maybe it's just my imagination</quote> and <quote>I can hear people's thoughts</quote>). These symptoms have been present for over two weeks and are causing significant distress and functional impairment, meeting the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> warrants the additional specifier of <med>psychotic features</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or another evidence-based therapy to address <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> or <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Close monitoring is essential to assess treatment response and manage potential side effects.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n5. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and implement a safety plan as needed.\n\n6. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to connect with supportive individuals and consider <med>interpersonal therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and improve social functioning.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
