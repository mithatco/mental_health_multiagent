        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were disclosed. No dimensions were skipped or superficially addressed.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. There were no instances of vague or imprecise language that could alter the clinical meaning of the questions.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation, and ensured a smooth conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria and considered alternative diagnoses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, which is affecting your daily life and relationships. You've shared that you're feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>irritable</med>, and it's concerning to hear that you've had <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. It's important to address these feelings and find ways to support your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a strong cluster of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> requires immediate attention and contributes to the clinical impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> may be related, but they do not fully meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> to determine the level of risk and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve their overall functioning.\n\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and support for improving <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include setting a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding stimulants before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n\n5. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, even if it feels challenging. <med>Supportive therapy</med> or <med>group therapy</med> can also be beneficial.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n\n7. **Education:** Educate the patient about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med> to help them understand their symptoms and the importance of treatment.\n\n8. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommend incorporating <med>regular exercise</med>, a <med>balanced diet</med>, and <med>mindfulness or relaxation techniques</med> to support overall mental health.\n\n9. **Assessment for Other Conditions:** Consider evaluating for other potential <med>mental health conditions</med> if symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment.",
