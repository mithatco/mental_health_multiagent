Co-occurring symptoms of generalized anxiety, including persistent worry and panic attacks, and dissociative experiences further complicate the clinical picture. The patient exhibits avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, which may be contributing to the overall distress. There are occasional thoughts of self-harm, indicating a need for ongoing assessment and monitoring of suicidal risk. The patient's cognitive difficulties and somatic symptoms require further evaluation to rule out potential underlying medical conditions. The patient denies substance use, which is a positive finding. Comprehensive psychological and medical evaluation is recommended to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
