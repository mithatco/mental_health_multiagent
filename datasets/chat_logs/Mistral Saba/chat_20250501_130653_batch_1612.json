This assessment is designed to help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks.

These symptoms suggest a core affective issue.\n- The patient experiences significant social anxiety (Q7) and avoidance behaviors (Q9), which are consistent with social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia.\n- There is a consistent theme of feeling detached from oneself and surroundings (Q19) and questioning one's identity and purpose (Q20).\n- Sleep disturbances, particularly difficulties falling back asleep, are reported (Q15).\n- There is a notable absence of psychotic symptoms (Q13, Q14) and compulsive behaviors (Q18), as well as substance use (Q22, Q23) and misuse of medications (Q24).\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Depression (Major Depressive Disorder)**: Symptoms of anhedonia, feelings of sadness, and sleep disturbances suggest a depressive episode.\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder**: High levels of anxiety in social situations, avoidance behaviors, and panic symptoms.\n- **Depersonalization**: Feeling detached from oneself, surroundings, and memories.\n- **Existential Crisis**: Feelings of detachment from personal identity and a lack of purpose in life.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- The patient does not report any current suicidal ideation (Q12), which is a positive sign.\n- The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance use is also reassuring.\n- The patient's avoidance behaviors and social anxiety could be contributing to social isolation and exacerbating depressive symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder, characterized by anhedonia, depressive mood, and sleep disturbances. There is also significant social anxiety with avoidance behaviors and panic-like symptoms, contributing to social isolation. The patient reports feelings of depersonalization and existential crisis, questioning their identity and purpose in life. These symptoms indicate a need for further psychological assessment and intervention to address the underlying affective and anxiety issues. Recommendations include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for both depression and anxiety, along with potential pharmacotherapy if indicated. Additionally, exploring existential and identity concerns through psychotherapy may be beneficial.",

The comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough understanding of the patient's symptoms.",

The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, ensuring a clear understanding of the patient's symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been feeling quite overwhelmed and disconnected lately. You've described a noticeable loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, a persistent sadness that's hard to shake off, and increased anxiety, particularly in social situations. You've also mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, as well as a sense of uncertainty about your identity and purpose. These feelings have been impacting your sleep and your relationships, making you feel more isolated. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life, and it's important to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your description matches the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with notable <sym>symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym> (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), depressive mood (\"feeling down more often than not\"), and sleep disturbances (\"trouble sleeping\"). Additionally, you reported significant <sym>social anxiety</sym> (\"felt nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge, especially in social situations\") and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (\"avoid social gatherings and sometimes even avoid going out in public\"), which align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>depersonalization</sym> (\"feeling like I'm watching myself from outside my body\") and existential concerns (\"wondering who I am and what I'm supposed to do with my life\") further suggest a complex interplay of affective and anxiety-related issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss these findings in more detail and explore treatment options.\n2. Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address both depressive and anxiety <sym>symptoms</sym>, focusing on challenging negative thought patterns and gradually exposing you to social situations.\n3. If indicated, discuss the possibility of <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with a psychiatrist to manage <sym>symptoms</sym> and improve overall functioning.\n4. Explore <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>existential therapy</med> approaches to help you reconnect with your sense of self and purpose.\n5. Encourage gradual re-engagement in social activities and hobbies, starting with low-stress environments to rebuild connections and interests.",
