          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n**Patient Presentation:**\n\nThe patient reports a range of symptoms indicative of significant psychological distress, likely related to a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder, possibly exacerbated by the recent divorce. The patient's responses suggest a prominent pattern of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with additional concerns related to cognitive functioning and interpersonal relationships.\n\n**Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n1. **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports a pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in activities (Q1), persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness (Q2), and anhedonia. The patient also mentions increased irritability (Q3), fatigue (Q4), and feelings of worthlessness or guilt (Q10).\n\n2. **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences frequent worry and anxiety (Q6), bodily sensations of panic (Q7), and avoidance of situations that trigger anxiety (Q8). The patient also reports intrusive thoughts (Q16) and feelings of detachment (Q18), which may be indicative of an anxiety disorder with dissociative features.\n\n3. **Cognitive Symptoms:** The patient reports memory problems (Q15) and feelings of disconnection from self and surroundings (Q18), which could suggest cognitive impairments related to their mental state.\n\n4. **Somatic Symptoms:** The patient mentions unexplained headaches and stomachaches (Q9), which may be somatic expressions of psychological distress.\n\n5. **Interpersonal Concerns:** The patient feels disconnected from family and friends (Q20), which may contribute to their overall distress and exacerbate feelings of isolation.\n\n**Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n- The patient consistently reports a pervasive sense of hopelessness and lack of energy.\n- There is a notable pattern of avoiding activities and social interactions due to feeling overwhelmed and anxious.\n- The patient's cognitive difficulties and feelings of disconnection suggest a broader impairment in their sense of self and reality.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n1. **Depressive Disorder:** The presence of depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness suggest a major depressive episode.\n2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's persistent worry, panic symptoms, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder.\n3. **Cognitive Impairment:** Cognitive difficulties and feelings of disconnection may require further assessment to rule out more severe cognitive impairments.\n4. **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained physical symptoms should be further evaluated to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n5. **Interpersonal Isolation:** The patient's disconnection from others may contribute to their depressive and anxious symptoms and should be addressed in therapy.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n\n- The patient reports suicidal ideation without intent to act (Q11), which necessitates careful monitoring.\n- The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of hopelessness may increase the risk of further social isolation and worsening symptoms.\n- The patient's confusion about self-identity and life purpose (Q19) could signal a deeper existential crisis.\n\n**Clinical Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder, with additional concerns related to cognitive functioning and interpersonal relationships. The patient's reports of anhedonia, depressed mood, anxiety symptoms, and interpersonal disconnection suggest a significant impairment in functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation warrants close monitoring and intervention. Further assessment is needed to evaluate the patient's cognitive symptoms and somatic complaints. Therapeutic intervention should focus on addressing depressive and anxiety symptoms, improving interpersonal connections, and enhancing the patient's sense of self and purpose.",

You've also mentioned feeling more irritable and anxious, with racing thoughts and moments of panic. It's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed and disconnected from yourself and others, and it's commendable that you're taking the step to seek help. Your honesty and openness are crucial in addressing these challenges together.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n<quote>I feel down most days. It's like a cloud is always hanging over my head, and I don't see much hope for the future</quote>. This, combined with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>, strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>.
