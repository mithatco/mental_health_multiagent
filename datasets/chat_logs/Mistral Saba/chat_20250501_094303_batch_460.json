It's clear that you've been going through significant emotional and psychological turmoil, with periods of intense energy and excitement followed by deep sadness and hopelessness. The rollercoaster of <sym>mood</sym> swings you described, along with the accompanying <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, has undoubtedly been overwhelming. It's important to recognize the strength it takes to seek help and the impact these experiences have had on your daily life and relationships.\n\n***\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar I Disorder, Severe, Without Psychotic Features\n\n***\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation aligns strongly with the criteria for <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The distinct periods of <sym>mania</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, described as <quote>a rollercoaster</quote>, are characteristic of this diagnosis. During manic episodes, the patient exhibits <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>grandiosity</sym>, as seen in the <quote>I can do anything</quote> attitude and purchasing a car they couldn't afford. Depressive episodes are marked by <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The patient's description of feeling <quote>super motivated and excited</quote> during manic episodes and <quote>this heavy weight</quote> during depressive episodes further supports this diagnosis. The absence of psychotic features, as indicated by the patient's responses, aligns with the specifier \"Without Psychotic Features.\"\n\n***\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the <med>bipolar disorder</med>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Initiate pharmacotherapy, focusing on mood stabilizers such as <med>lithium</med> or <med>valproic acid</med>, and possibly an <med>antidepressant</med> under close monitoring to manage both manic and depressive episodes.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <med>Psychotherapy</med> to address <sym>impulsivity</sym> and <sym>risky behavior</sym>.\n4. **Substance Use and Safety Planning:** Address the patient's history of <med>antidepressant</med> misuse and develop a safety plan to manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>impulsive behavior</sym>.\n5. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Encourage regular sleep, exercise, and a healthy diet to stabilize mood and energy levels.\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Involve family members or close friends in the treatment process to provide emotional support and help monitor mood fluctuations.\n7. **Educational Resources:** Provide resources and education about <med>bipolar disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system better understand the condition and its management.\n8. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust medication as needed, and ensure ongoing support.",
