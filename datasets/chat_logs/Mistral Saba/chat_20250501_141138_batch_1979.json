This assessment is designed to help us understand your overall mental health status by evaluating various symptoms over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to describe how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem. Let's begin."
