These <sym>symptoms</sym> are causing me a lot of distress.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n***Reasoning:*** The patient's report of persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, along with <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, strongly suggests <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym> <symptoms</sym> could be related to the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), to manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> by implementing good sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Monitoring of <sym>Suicidal Thoughts</sym>:** Given the patient's mention of <sym>thoughts of death</sym>, it is crucial to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely and ensure the patient's safety. Regular follow-ups and safety planning may be necessary.\n5. **Education on <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>:** Provide education about the connection between <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <med>mental health</med> conditions. Encourage the patient to communicate their <sym>physical discomfort</sym> to their primary care physician while emphasizing the psychological component.\n6. **Gradual Exposure Therapy:** Implement gradual exposure therapy to help the patient overcome <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> related to social situations and leaving the house.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
