You've shared that you've been feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym>, and you've lost interest in things you used to enjoy. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're reaching out for support. You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym>, especially when reminded of a past accident. Additionally, you've been struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>uneasy aches and pains</sym>, and a sense of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and others. It sounds like you've been going through a lot, and I'm here to help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**<med>Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>**\n\n**<med>Reasoning:</med>** The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms that align with both <med>major depressive disorder</med> and <med>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med>. Symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med> include <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The patient's anxiety and avoidance behaviors, particularly in relation to a past accident, suggest a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>. The patient's disconnection and questioning of identity may also be related to these conditions. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>occasional alcohol use</sym> to manage <sym>sleep issues</sym>, which is a concern for potential <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n**<med>Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:</med>**\n\n1. **<med>Psychoeducation</med>:** Provide the patient with information about <med>major depressive disorder</med> and <med>PTSD</med>, including their symptoms, causes, and treatment options.\n\n2. **<med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>:** Recommend CBT to help the patient manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> related to the past accident.\n\n3. **<med>Transtraumatic Therapy</med>:** Consider <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure Therapy</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n\n4. **<med>Medication Management</med>:** Discuss potential <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications with the patient's primary care physician or psychiatrist.\n\n5. **<med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med>:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce the need for alcohol to fall asleep.\n\n6. **<med>Substance Use Assessment</med>:** Assess the patient's alcohol use and provide appropriate interventions if necessary.\n\n7. **<med>Follow-up Appointments</med>:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n\n8. **<med>Cultural Considerations</med>:** As per the DSM, cultural factors may influence the patient's experience of distress and treatment options. Use the cultural formulation interview guide to assess and address these factors.",
