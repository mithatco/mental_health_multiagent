      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been experiencing significant shifts in your mood and energy levels, which can be quite challenging and overwhelming. You've described feelings of hopelessness and a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, which are common <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>depression</med>. You also mentioned periods of increased energy and impulsivity, which are characteristic of <med>manic</med> episodes. It's understandable that these fluctuations can be difficult to manage and may impact your relationships and daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar II Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pattern of alternating <sym>depressive</sym> and <med>hypomanic</med> episodes. During depressive phases, they experience <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as unexplained aches and pains, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>. During manic phases, they report <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> such as purchasing an unaffordable car. This oscillating pattern aligns with the criteria for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>, which is characterized by recurrent <med>depressive</med> episodes and <med>hypomanic</med> episodes. The patient's frustration with medical professionals not understanding the bipolar nature of their illness further supports this diagnosis, as it suggests a history of misdiagnosis or underrecognition of <med>bipolar</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a Psychiatrist:** Consultation with a psychiatrist can help confirm the diagnosis and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> such as <med>lithium</med> or <med>valproic acid</med>, and <med>antidepressants</med> if indicated. <med>Anti-anxiety</med> medication may also be considered if <sym>anxiety</sym> is a significant issue.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, while Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) can help stabilize mood swings.\n4. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Regular sleep hygiene, stress management techniques, and maintaining a consistent daily routine can help stabilize mood.\n5. **Education and Support:** Provide education about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and support groups can help the patient understand their condition better and connect with others who have similar experiences.\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regular follow-ups with both the psychiatrist and a primary care physician can help monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.",
