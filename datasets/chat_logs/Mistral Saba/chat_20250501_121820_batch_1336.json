You've also been experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry, which has led you to avoid certain situations. Additionally, you've been dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>physical aches and pains</sym>. You've also expressed <sym>feelings of depersonalization</sym> and <sym>identity disturbance</sym>, and have withdrawn from social interactions. Most concerning is that you've had thoughts of hurting yourself, which is a serious matter that needs to be addressed immediately.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. They also exhibit <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, which are common in <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>feelings of depersonalization</sym> and <sym>identity disturbance</sym> may suggest comorbid <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>, but the primary presentation is consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment and Plan:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to conduct a thorough assessment of their immediate safety risks and implement a safety plan.\n2. **Referral to Psychiatry:** The patient should be referred to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and consideration of <med>pharmacological treatment</med>, such as antidepressant medication.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** The patient should engage in evidence-based psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med>, to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide the patient with education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve their <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with their support system and engage in social activities to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
