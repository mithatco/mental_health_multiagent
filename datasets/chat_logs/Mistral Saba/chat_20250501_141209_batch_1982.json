        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was addressed with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, the patient was asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' and 'suicidal ideation,' demonstrating a comprehensive approach.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used aligned well with DSM-5 terminology, and the questions were phrased in clinically accurate ways. For instance, the therapist asked about 'persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness' and 'sleep disturbances,' which are key symptoms in the DSM-5.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and adequately followed up on concerning disclosures. For example, after the patient mentioned 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist addressed it with sensitivity and ensured the patient's safety.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder clearly aligns with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to the DSM-5 criteria, demonstrating a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses show consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, the therapist expressed understanding and support when the patient discussed their 'feelings of hopelessness and despair.'"

The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, asked clinically relevant questions, maintained a logical flow, provided a well-justified diagnosis, and interacted with empathy and professionalism.
