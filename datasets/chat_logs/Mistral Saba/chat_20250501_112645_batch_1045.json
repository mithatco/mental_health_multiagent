Focus on addressing negative thought patterns, enhancing coping skills, and improving self-esteem.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <sym>antidepressant</sym> medication, which can help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep</sym> habits, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Somatic Symptom Management:** Address <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> through a combination of <sym>pain management</sym> techniques, stress reduction strategies, and further medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical conditions.\n6. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Encourage the patient to engage in <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> to address feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and emotional distancing from others.",
