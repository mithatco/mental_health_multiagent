Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - **Depressed Mood:** Patient reports feelings of depression, hopelessness, and a general sense of apathy towards activities previously enjoyed (A1, A2).\n   - **Anxiety:** Frequent feelings of nervousness, anxiousness, and panic attacks (A6, A7). Avoidance of situations that trigger anxiety (A8).\n   - **Sleep Disturbance:** Increased sleep duration but reports of poor sleep quality and non-restorative sleep (A4, A14).\n   - **Derealization/Depersonalization:** Occasional feelings of detachment from oneself and the environment (A18).\n   - **Identity Disturbance:** Feelings of not knowing oneself or what one wants from life (A19).\n   - **Social Withdrawal:** Pulling away from social interactions and feeling like a burden to others (A20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n   - **Consistent Theme of Dysphoria:** Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and lack of pleasure in activities.\n   - **Avoidance Behaviors:** Avoidance of anxiety-inducing situations and social interactions.\n   - **Somatic Symptoms:** Physical manifestations of stress, such as constant tension in shoulders and back (A9).\n   - **Cognitive Distortions:** Intrusive thoughts and questioning of one's identity and purpose in life (A16, A19).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Major Depressive Disorder:** Based on the reported symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and feelings of hopelessness.\n   - **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** Given the pervasive anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n   - **Panic Disorder:** Due to frequent panic attacks and fear of crowded places.\n   - **Dissociative Symptoms:** Occasional feelings of detachment and derealization.\n   - **Possible Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Persistent somatic symptoms, although not specific to a particular organ system.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Patient denies suicidal thoughts (A11), but the presence of depressed mood and hopelessness warrants further exploration.\n   - **Panic Attacks:** Frequent panic attacks and avoidance behaviors suggest a risk of developing agoraphobia.\n   - **Social Isolation:** Increased risk of exacerbating depressive symptoms due to social withdrawal.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\n   The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of Major Depressive Disorder, including persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and feelings of hopelessness. Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder are also evident, with frequent panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and pervasive anxiety. Additionally, the patient exhibits dissociative symptoms and a sense of identity disturbance, which may be indicative of a dissociative disorder. The patient's increased sleep duration but poor sleep quality, along with constant somatic tension, suggests a possible Somatic Symptom Disorder. There are no immediate risk factors for self-harm, but the presence of suicidal ideation requires further assessment. The patient's social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors are concerning and may exacerbate depressive symptoms. Further evaluation and treatment planning are recommended to address the primary and comorbid mental health issues.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate you taking the time to share how you're feeling. It sounds like you've been experiencing a significant amount of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> recently. <quote>I've been feeling less interested in things I used to enjoy</quote> and <quote>I feel down a lot, and sometimes I wonder what the point of everything is</quote>. These feelings have been accompanied by <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and a sense of being overwhelmed. It's also concerning that you've been <sym>avoiding situations that make you anxious</sym> and feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. It's important to address these feelings together, as they often interrelate and can be challenging to manage alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>detachment from oneself and surroundings</sym> could indicate a <med>dissociative symptom</med>, but more information is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>identity disturbance</sym> may also be related to <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as <sym>tension</sym> in shoulders and back could be related to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Referral to a <med>mental health professional</med>** for a comprehensive evaluation and to confirm the provisional diagnosis.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** to address <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. CBT can help the patient manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> by identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to help manage <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Additionally, <med>benzodiazepines</med> may be prescribed for short-term management of <sym>panic attacks</med>, but should be used with caution due to the risk of dependence.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include strategies such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Supportive Therapy:** Offer <med>supportive therapy</med> to help the patient cope with <sym>identity disturbance</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. This can provide a safe space to explore feelings and gain insight into personal experiences.\n6. **Monitoring for Risk of Self-Harm:** Given the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, it is crucial to monitor the patient for any increase in <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety.",
