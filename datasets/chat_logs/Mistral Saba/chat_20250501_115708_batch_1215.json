The patient reports significant mood disturbances, including depressed mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness, along with recurrent panic and anxiety. Sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and somatic symptoms are also notable. The patient feels disconnected from self and others, and the use of alcohol to aid sleep raises concerns about potential substance use issues. The patient's feelings of not being taken seriously and recurrent intrusive thoughts related to a past accident warrant further exploration. The overall clinical picture suggests a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms. Further assessment and treatment planning should address these areas to provide comprehensive care.",

You've shared that you've been feeling <sym>down and hopeless</sym>, with little interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from yourself and others. It's understandable that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life and relationships. It's commendable that you've reached out for help, as this is an important step towards feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core <symptoms</sym> of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are also associated with <med>MDD</med>. The patient denies <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, making <med>MDD</med> a fitting provisional diagnosis. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to a past accident and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> may also suggest features of <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>), but the <symptoms</sym> presented are more indicative of <med>MDD</med>. The use of alcohol to aid sleep raises concerns about potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, but this should be explored further.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess the <sym>symptoms</sym> and their impact on the patient's life.\n2. Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>medication management</med> options, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>), to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> by implementing <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices and, if necessary, prescribing <med>sleep aids</med>.\n5. Assess for potential <med>PTSD</med> and refer to a trauma-informed therapist if warranted.\n6. Monitor <sym>alcohol use</sym> and, if necessary, refer to an <med>addiction specialist</med> for further evaluation and treatment.\n7. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>supportive relationships</med> and consider joining a <med>support group</med> for individuals with <med>MDD</med>.\n8. Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> and its treatment options to empower them in their journey towards recovery.",
