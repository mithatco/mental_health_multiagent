This questionnaire will help us understand how you've been feeling and any symptoms you're experiencing. All the information you share will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to express yourself. There are 23 questions in total, and we'll go through them one by one. Let's begin. First, do you feel that you have little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and increased alcohol use may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms to manage intrusive thoughts and anxiety. Notably, the patient expresses feelings of hopelessness and a wish for things to stop, which requires further exploration for potential suicidal ideation. The patient's social withdrawal and identity confusion further highlight the need for comprehensive mental health assessment and intervention.",

It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of <sym>challenging emotions</sym> and <sym>changes in behavior</sym> since the accident. It's clear that you've been feeling <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>irritable</sym>, and <sym>anxious</sym>, and that many of the activities and people you used to enjoy have lost their appeal. You've also been struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym>, which can be incredibly taxing. It's important to remember that it's okay to ask for help and that there are professionals here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with <med>alcohol use disorder</med> contributing to <med>sleep-wake disorders</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a history of a traumatic event (the accident), which has led to a persistent pattern of <sym>avoidance</sym>, <sym>re-experiencing</sym> (<sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>), and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> (<sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>), consistent with <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's increased <sym>alcohol use</sym> as a coping mechanism may be contributing to their <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and could develop into an <med>alcohol use disorder</med>\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **PSYCHOTHERAPY:** Refer the patient for <med>traumat-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>TF-CBT</med>) to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms. This may include <med>prolonged exposure therapy</med> (<med>PE</med>) and <med>cognitive processing therapy</med> (<med>CPT</med>).\n2. **MEDICATIONS:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss medications for <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>). Consider <med>prazosin</med> for <sym>nightmares</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> related to <med>PTSD</med>.\n3. **SUBSTANCE USE EVALUATION:** Assess the patient's <sym>alcohol use</sym> pattern and provide education on safe drinking limits or refer to a <med>substance use disorder</med> specialist if necessary.\n4. **SLEEP HYGIENE:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and limit <sym>alcohol</sym> consumption before bedtime.\n5. **SUPPORT GROUP:** Encourage the patient to join a support group for trauma survivors to share experiences, gain insights, and learn coping strategies.\n6. **REGULAR FOLLOW-UP:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
