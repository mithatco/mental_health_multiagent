Key symptoms include anhedonia, depressed mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, auditory hallucinations, thought insertion, derealization, identity disturbance, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms point to a possible diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possibly a Dissociative Disorder. The patient's avoidance behaviors and relationship distress further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms necessitates immediate attention and a thorough risk assessment. Further evaluation and intervention are warranted to manage these symptoms and ensure the patient's safety.",

These symptoms suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (<quote>sometimes I hear voices when there's no one around</quote>) and <sym>thought insertion</sym> (<quote>It's like my thoughts aren't private</quote>) indicates <med>Psychotic Features</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> (<quote>a lot</quote>), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (<quote>Sometimes I get these panic attacks</quote>), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (<quote>I stay home a lot</quote>), which are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the symptoms.\n2. **Medication:** Consider <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic</med> medications to manage <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. For <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>antianxiety medication</med> or <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> may be beneficial.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <med>psychotic symptoms</med>. <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> can also be helpful for managing <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>relationship distress</med>.\n4. **Support Group:** Join a support group for individuals with <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to share experiences and gain coping strategies.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Incorporate <med>lifestyle changes</med> such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to support overall mental health.\n6. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-ups with a mental health professional to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n8. **Explore Additional Therapies:** Consider <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or <med>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</med> to address <sym>trauma</sym> and <sym>anxiety</med>.",
