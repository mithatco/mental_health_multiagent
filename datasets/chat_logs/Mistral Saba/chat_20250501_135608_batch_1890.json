Although the patient denies suicidal thoughts, ongoing monitoring is necessary.\n- The presence of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors could escalate and impact the patient's ability to function in daily life.\n- The patient mentions intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, which, if not addressed, could worsen and impact overall quality of life.\n\n**Summary in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex symptom profile characterized by depressive symptoms, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive features, and depersonalization. The patient's subjective report indicates significant emotional distress, impaired functioning, and social withdrawal. The presence of anxiety and depression, coupled with avoidance behaviors and intrusive thoughts, necessitates further evaluation and intervention to prevent potential escalation and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.
