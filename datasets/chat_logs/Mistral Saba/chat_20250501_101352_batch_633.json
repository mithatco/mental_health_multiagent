This tool helps us understand various aspects of your well-being over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer by telling me how much or how often you've been bothered by each issue. Let's start with the first question: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Sleep disturbances and somatic complaints are also present, contributing to overall distress. The patient exhibits dissociative symptoms and reports interpersonal difficulties, which may further exacerbate their emotional state. The absence of substance use and non-prescribed medication use is noted. Further assessment and intervention are recommended to address these symptoms and improve the patient's overall well-being and functioning.",

      "predicted": "I truly appreciate your openness and the effort you've put into sharing your experiences. It sounds like you've been feeling quite overwhelmed and distressed lately. You've mentioned a significant decrease in interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. You've also been experiencing frequent <sym>nervousness</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with several <sym>panic attacks</sym> that leave you feeling frightened and overwhelmed. These <sym>panic attacks</sym> have led to avoidance behaviors, such as avoiding public transportation and crowded spaces, which has impacted your daily life. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling and staying asleep, as well as <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomach pain. You also mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings at times, and a sense of disconnection from others. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been causing you significant distress and disrupting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>) and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** <quote>Little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote>, <quote>Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</quote>, and <quote>Feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual</quote> align with the <med>MDD</med> criteria of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> (<quote>Unexplained aches and pains</quote>), and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> (<quote>Feeling detached or distant from yourself, your body, your physical surroundings, or your memories</quote>), which are common in <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> also indicates a <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider initiating <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. These evidence-based treatments can help you develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n2. **Medication Management**: Consultation with a psychiatrist or a primary care physician for a medication evaluation is recommended. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or other <med>antidepressants</med> may be beneficial for <med>MDD</med>, while <med>anxiolytics</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> with <sym>anxiolytic</sym> properties may help manage <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implementing good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices can help improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Support Network**: Encouraging the patient to reconnect with friends and family can help alleviate feelings of social isolation and provide additional support. Support groups for individuals with <med>MDD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> may also be beneficial.\n\n5. **Monitoring of Somatic Symptoms**: Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and ensure they are not indicative of an underlying physical health issue or <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n6. **Safety Planning**: Given the patient's <quote>Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> and <quote>Not knowing who you really are or what you want out of life</quote>, it is crucial to assess for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan if necessary. This may include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support persons to contact in times of crisis.",
