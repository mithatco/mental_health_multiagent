Key symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, persistent anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms, and intrusive thoughts. The patient also exhibits obsessive-compulsive behaviors and feelings of detachment, which may further impair social functioning. While there are no immediate suicidal ideations, the patient's feelings of hopelessness and helplessness necessitate close monitoring for any escalation in risk. Further assessment and possible psychological interventions are recommended to address these symptoms and improve overall mental health and functioning.",

The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>obsessive behaviors</sym> you've described also contribute to your distress. It must be challenging to navigate through these emotions and physical sensations daily.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> points to a <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The constant <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with a <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> are consistent with <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> might be stress-related, but they do not sufficiently meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider beginning with <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as obsessive-compulsive behaviors.\n2. **Medication**: Consult with a psychiatrist for potential <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to help manage symptoms.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement a structured sleep schedule, and consider <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve sleep quality.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Incorporate <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage anxiety and stress.\n5. **Support Network**: Encourage reconnecting with social supports and <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address feelings of detachment and improve relationships.\n6. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
