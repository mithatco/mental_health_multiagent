Antipsychotics may also be considered for severe manic symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <cognitive-behavioral therapy> (CBT) or <interpersonal and social rhythm therapy> (IPSRT) to develop coping strategies, improve mood regulation, and stabilize daily routines.\n3. **Education and Support:** Participate in psychoeducation programs to learn about <Bipolar Disorder>, its triggers, and management strategies. Join support groups to share experiences and gain insights from others facing similar challenges.\n4. **Lifestyle Management:** Establish a regular sleep schedule, engage in physical activity, and maintain a balanced diet to support overall mental health. Avoid <substance use>, as it can exacerbate mood swings and hinder recovery.\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups with your mental health provider to monitor symptoms, adjust medication as needed, and address any emerging concerns or <suicidal ideation>.\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Involve trusted friends and family in your treatment plan to provide a support system and help you manage stress and maintain stability.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been experiencing significant emotional ups and downs, including periods of intense energy and enthusiasm followed by profound sadness and hopelessness. These fluctuations have been affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. It's important to acknowledge the challenges you're facing and to remember that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar I Disorder, Severe\n\n**Reasoning:** Your description of alternating periods of <manic> episodes, characterized by decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, and impulsive behavior, along with <depressive> episodes marked by <anhedonia>, <hopelessness>, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating, aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <Bipolar I Disorder> as outlined in the DSM-5. The presence of both <mania> and <depression> indicates a severe form of the disorder. Additionally, your reports of <anxiety> and <sleep disturbances> are common comorbidities that further support this diagnosis. The absence of <psychotic> features and the presence of <mood-congruent> <psychotic> symptoms during manic episodes do not change the diagnosis. The <sym>fluctuating mood states> and <sym>impairment in functioning> are consistent with a severe presentation of <Bipolar I Disorder>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <mood stabilizers> such as lithium or anticonvulsants, and <antidepressants> if needed, to manage both manic and depressive episodes. Antipsychotics may also be considered for severe manic symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <cognitive-behavioral therapy> (CBT) or <interpersonal and social rhythm therapy> (IPSRT) to develop coping strategies, improve mood regulation, and stabilize daily routines.\n3. **Education and Support:** Participate in psychoeducation programs to learn about <Bipolar Disorder>, its triggers, and management strategies. Join support groups to share experiences and gain insights from others facing similar challenges.\n4. **Lifestyle Management:** Establish a regular sleep schedule, engage in physical activity, and maintain a balanced diet to support overall mental health. Avoid <substance use>, as it can exacerbate mood swings and hinder recovery.\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups with your mental health provider to monitor symptoms, adjust medication as needed, and address any emerging concerns or <suicidal ideation>.\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Involve trusted friends and family in your treatment plan to provide a support system and help you manage stress and maintain stability.",
