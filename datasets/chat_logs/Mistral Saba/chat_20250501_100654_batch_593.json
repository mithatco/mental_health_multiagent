You've also mentioned increased irritability, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and feeling disconnected from yourself and others. These feelings can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that help is available, and you don't have to go through this alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of major depressive disorder. Additional symptoms include <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym>, which meets the criteria for <med>anxious distress</med> specifier. The patient's report of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>identity concerns</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's mention of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent requires careful assessment and monitoring. The severity is rated as severe due to the marked impairment in functioning and the presence of suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Psychotherapy: Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. CBT can help the patient develop coping skills, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal relationships.\n2. Medication: Consider starting <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. Close monitoring for potential side effects and suicidality is essential.\n3. Sleep Hygiene: Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n4. Interpersonal Therapy: Address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> through interpersonal therapy, which can help improve communication, build social support, and resolve interpersonal conflicts.\n5. Psychiatric Evaluation: Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess for any co-occurring <med>mental health conditions</med> and to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n6. Psychoeducation: Provide the patient with information about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, its treatment, and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan. Encourage the patient's involvement in the decision-making process and collaboration in treatment planning.\n7. Follow-up: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging concerns or symptoms.",

Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Depression:** Symptoms of anhedonia, depressed mood, and hopelessness are indicative of depressive symptoms.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurrent thoughts, avoidance of certain situations, and panic attacks suggest potential anxiety disorders.\n- **Insomnia and Hypersomnia:** Sleep disturbances that may be related to mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- **Cognitive Impairment:** Issues with memory and concentration, indicating potential cognitive difficulties.\n- **Interpersonal Relationships:** Difficulty maintaining close relationships, which may be a contributing factor to depressive symptoms.\n- **Identity and Existential Concerns:** Reoccurring feelings of uncertainty about personal identity and life goals.\n\n**4.

Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of depression, anxiety, and potential cognitive difficulties, along with interpersonal strain and identity concerns. Key symptoms include anhedonia, depressed mood, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and feelings of detachment.

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a lot lately. You've expressed feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned increased irritability, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and feeling disconnected from yourself and others. These feelings can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that help is available, and you don't have to go through this alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of major depressive disorder. Additional symptoms include <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym>, which meets the criteria for <med>anxious distress</med> specifier. The patient's report of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>identity concerns</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's mention of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent requires careful assessment and monitoring. The severity is rated as severe due to the marked impairment in functioning and the presence of suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Psychotherapy: Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. CBT can help the patient develop coping skills, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal relationships.\n2. Medication: Consider starting <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. Close monitoring for potential side effects and suicidality is essential.\n3. Sleep Hygiene: Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n4. Interpersonal Therapy: Address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> through interpersonal therapy, which can help improve communication, build social support, and resolve interpersonal conflicts.\n5. Psychiatric Evaluation: Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess for any co-occurring <med>mental health conditions</med> and to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n6. Psychoeducation: Provide the patient with information about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, its treatment, and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan. Encourage the patient's involvement in the decision-making process and collaboration in treatment planning.\n7. Follow-up: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging concerns or symptoms.",
