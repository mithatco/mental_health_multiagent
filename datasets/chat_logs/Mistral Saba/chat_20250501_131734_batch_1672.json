      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a challenging time, marked by a significant loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and heightened irritability. You've also been struggling with sleep disturbances, anxiety, and a sense of disconnection from yourself and others.

Additionally, frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic symptoms</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms indicates a need for a comprehensive evaluation to determine the best course of treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnoses and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.

CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns, which are prevalent in all three conditions.\n\n3. **Medication Review:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss potential medication options. <med>Antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med> may be considered to manage <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRI</med> medications may also be beneficial for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Implement good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This includes establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime. Consider <med>sleep</med> therapy if necessary.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Strengthen your social network and consider joining a <med>support group</med> for individuals experiencing similar challenges. Engaging with others who understand your struggles can provide emotional support and practical advice.\n\n6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Practice mindfulness meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. These techniques can help you stay grounded and reduce stress.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed. Open communication with your healthcare provider is crucial for effective management of your conditions.",
