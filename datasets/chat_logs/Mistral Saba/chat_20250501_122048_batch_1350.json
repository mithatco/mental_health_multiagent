This assessment is designed to help us understand your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. Please know that your responses will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to share. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can take your time to respond. Let's start with the first question: How much have you lacked interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

Key symptoms include mood swings, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, impulsive behavior, anxiety, dissociation, and identity confusion. The patient's risk factors include a history of mood swings, impulsivity, and potential for social isolation.

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing significant <sym>mood swings</sym> over the past two weeks, with periods of feeling extremely <sym>low and hopeless</sym> followed by times of intense <sym>energy and motivation</sym>. It sounds like you've been struggling with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, especially during your <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, and have had difficulty maintaining interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your <sym>sleep patterns</sym> have also been disrupted, with <sym>hypersomnia</sym> during <sym>depressive episodes</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym> during <sym>manic episodes</sym>. Your behavior has oscillated between <sym>impulsivity</sym> and <sym>withdrawal</sym>, affecting your social interactions and decision-making. Additionally, you've mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, especially during your <sym>lower moods</sym>.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Mixed\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's description of alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Mixed</med>. The patient reports <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behavior</sym> during <sym>manic episodes</sym>, along with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. The patient's report of <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>mood-dependent symptoms</sym> further supports this diagnosis. There is no indication of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, which can be seen in <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to review and adjust <med>mood stabilizers</med> and <med>antipsychotics</med> to manage <sym>mood swings</sym> and prevent <sym>manic episodes</sym>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. <med>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)</med> can help stabilize <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>sleep patterns</sym>.\n3. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient and their support system about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to promote understanding and provide coping strategies.\n4. **Substance Use Monitoring:** Regularly assess for <med>substance use disorders</med> and provide support for maintaining abstinence, as <sym>substance use</sym> can exacerbate <sym>bipolar symptoms</sym>.\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to maintain a strong support network and engage in social activities during <sym>manic episodes</sym> to prevent <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule routine appointments to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym>, adjust <med>medications</med> as needed, and provide ongoing <med>psychotherapy</med>.",
