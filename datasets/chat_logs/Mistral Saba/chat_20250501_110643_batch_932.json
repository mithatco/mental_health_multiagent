You've also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about the future, as well as feeling disconnected from yourself and others.

The symptoms described, such as persistent depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, and somatic symptoms, are core symptoms of MDD, not adjustment disorder. While adjustment disorder often presents with emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to a stressor, the primary presentation here aligns more closely with MDD.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate you taking the time to share these feelings and experiences with me. It sounds like you've been going through a significant amount of distress lately. You've described feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> most of the time, with a notable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about the future, as well as feeling disconnected from yourself and others. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your ability to engage in daily activities and maintain social connections, which is causing you considerable distress. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches add to your discomfort, and it's understandable that you feel like your concerns aren't being taken seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, which are core <symptoms</sym> of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient also experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> without clear medical explanation, which are common accompanying <symptoms</sym> of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> further support this diagnosis. While the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> with intent, the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent is a risk factor that warrants careful monitoring. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could also indicate the presence of <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>, but the primary presentation is more consistent with <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychotherapy</med>: Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal relationships. These <med>therapies</med> have been shown to be effective in treating <med>MDD</med>.\n\n2. <med>Pharmacological treatment</med>: Discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant medication</med> as an option to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>MDD</med>.\n\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene education</med>: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help the patient improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n\n4. <med>Regular check-ins</med>: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, assess <med>treatment</med> effectiveness, and provide ongoing support.\n\n5. <med>Psychoeducation</med>: Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> to help them understand their <symptoms</sym> and the importance of <med>treatment</med> adherence.\n\n6. <med>Collaborative care</med>: Encourage the patient to involve trusted friends, family, or support groups in their <med>treatment</med> process, as <sym>social withdrawal</sym> can exacerbate <med>MDD</med>.\n\n7. <med>Monitoring of suicidal ideation</med>: Regularly assess the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure a safety plan is in place. If the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> increases, immediate psychiatric evaluation may be necessary.",
