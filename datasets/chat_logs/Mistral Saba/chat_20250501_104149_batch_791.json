Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Thoughts of death, though no active suicidal intent has been reported.\n- **Substance Use:** Though not currently an issue, the patient's impulsive behavior (e.g., buying a car they can't afford) could indicate a risk for potential substance use issues.\n- **Impulsivity:** High impulsivity and risk-taking behavior (e.g., starting multiple projects) could lead to harmful actions or decisions.\n\n#### 5.

There are indications of interpersonal disconnection and potential identity distress. The patient's sleep patterns are highly variable, and there are concerns about impulsive behavior and suicidal ideation.
