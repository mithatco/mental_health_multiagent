Although the patient exhibits some symptoms that could be associated with bipolar disorder, such as impulsivity and risky behaviors, the diagnosis focuses on depressive symptoms and anxiety. The mention of 'started lots more projects than usual' and 'made some risky financial decisions' could suggest hypomanic or manic symptoms, but these are not explicitly addressed or integrated into a bipolar diagnosis.",
