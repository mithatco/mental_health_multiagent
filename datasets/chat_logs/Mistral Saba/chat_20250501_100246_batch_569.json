      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time recently. You've shared that you've been feeling down and hopeless almost every day, and that things you used to enjoy no longer bring you the same pleasure. You've also mentioned feeling anxious and on edge frequently, and sometimes even panicked. These feelings have led you to avoid certain situations and people, causing you to feel isolated. Additionally, you've been experiencing intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, as well as feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your identity. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been persistent and are impacting your daily life. It's clear that you're struggling, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <med>anxiety</med> and <med>obsessive-compulsive</med> features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The frequent feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms, along with <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> indicates <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> features. The <sym>derealization/ depersonalization</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> could be related to these primary disorders or may indicate a need for further evaluation. The patient's <sym>interpersonal disconnection</sym> is likely a result of these <sym>symptoms</sym> and may benefit from targeted interventions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a thorough evaluation and potential <med>pharmacological</med> intervention, focusing on <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n2. Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <med>OCD</med> <sym>symptoms</sym>. This could include <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> techniques specifically for <med>OCD</med>.\n3. Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> to address <sym>interpersonal disconnection</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n4. Encourage regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Educate the patient on <sym>self-care</sym> strategies and lifestyle modifications to support overall mental health.\n6. Assess for <med>substance use</med> and <med>suicidal ideation</med> at each follow-up, given the patient's expressed feelings of being overwhelmed.",
