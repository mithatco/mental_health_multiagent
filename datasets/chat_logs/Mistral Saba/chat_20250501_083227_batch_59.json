Additionally, the patient exhibits constant worry and anxiety, though not to the extent of panic. The patient's passive suicidal ideation, sleep disturbances, and cognitive issues warrant careful monitoring and further evaluation. The overall presentation suggests a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and intervention to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It has been a challenging time for you lately, and I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences. You've been feeling down and hopeless, with a sense of emptiness that makes it hard to find enjoyment in anything. You've also been struggling with sleep disturbances, persistent worry, and cognitive difficulties. Additionally, you've withdrawn from social interactions, feeling detached and unsure about your identity. These feelings are significant and it's important to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with <med>Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>constant worry</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, though not rising to the level of panic, suggest the presence of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> are also consistent with MDD. While the patient does not endorse <sym>panic attacks</sym> or <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, the overall constellation of symptoms strongly suggests MDD with co-occurring <med>Anxiety</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation:</med> Conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. <med>Pharmacological Intervention:</med> Consider <med>antidepressant medications</med> to help manage symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used first-line treatments.\n3. <med>Psychotherapy:</med> Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and manage <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education:</med> Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep quality</sym> to address the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. <med>Regular Follow-ups:</med> Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety, particularly given the <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>.",
