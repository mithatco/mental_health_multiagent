This questionnaire will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and we're here to create a safe space for you. There are 23 questions in total. Let's start with the first one: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things lately?"

      "content": "Yeah, I have. I used to enjoy my hobbies and spending time with friends, but lately, it feels like nothing really interests me. It's like I'm going through the motions. I get this feeling like I should be able to snap out of it, but it's just not happening."

You describe feeling a persistent sadness and loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy, which has left you feeling disconnected from yourself and those around you. Your sleep is disrupted, and you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are making daily life challenging. You also mentioned <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and behaviors, as well as <sym>unexplained physical symptoms</sym> that are causing you concern. It's understandable that these experiences are overwhelming, and it's important to address them with care and attention to detail.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>persistent worry</sym>, <sym>physical tension</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, indicative of <med>generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</med>. The presence of <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> suggests <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</med> traits. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> further highlight the complexity of the patient's mental health situation. While <med>somatic symptom disorder</med> is a consideration, the prominent <med>anxiety</med> and <med>mood</med> symptoms warrant primary attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>OCD</med> traits. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies for managing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, as well as techniques to reduce <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>.\n\n2. **Medication Review:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss potential <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Consider <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for their dual action on <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and potential use of <med>sleep aids</med> under medical supervision. Encourage regular sleep patterns and a relaxing bedtime routine.\n\n4. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to seek support from family and friends, and consider <med>family therapy</med> to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and improve communication and connection within the family.\n\n5. **Somatic Symptom Management:** Educate the patient about <med>somatic symptom disorder</med> and ensure that <sym>physical symptoms</sym> are appropriately evaluated and managed. Refer to a <med>primary care physician</med> if necessary to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\n6. **Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's <sym>fleeting thoughts</sym> of not wanting to be here, conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> and develop a safety plan if necessary. Ensure the patient has access to supportive resources and a safety net in case of future crises.",
