This assessment will help us identify any symptoms you may be experiencing across various mental health domains. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and this space is safe for you to express your feelings. We will go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to rate how much each problem has bothered you in the past two weeks. Are you comfortable with that? Let's start with the first question. Do you have little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "content": "You've been enduring a significant amount of distress lately, and it's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed by various <sym>symptoms</sym> that have been affecting your daily life. You've expressed a persistent <sym>sense of hopelessness</sym>, accompanied by a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. This <sym>anhedonia</sym> is coupled with a heavy feeling of fatigue, despite sleeping for extended periods. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, with constant worries and occasional <sym>panic-like</sym> feelings. Cognitive struggles, such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and a general <sym>sense of detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, add to your burden. You've also whispered about feeling lost and uncertain about your identity and the value of your life. These feelings have led to a withdrawal from social interactions, leaving you feeling more isolated than ever.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major depressive disorder with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). The presence of <sym>anxious distress</sym> is evident through the patient's constant worries and occasional <sym>panic-like</sym> feelings. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as memory problems and a general <sym>sense of detachment</sym>, as well as <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, further support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms have been present for over three months, meeting the duration criterion for <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>. This type of therapy can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge distorted thoughts.\n\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or a primary care physician for an evaluation of medication options. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other <med>antidepressants</med> may be considered to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> to determine the patient's immediate safety and develop a safety plan. This may include removing access to lethal means, establishing a support network, and creating a crisis intervention plan.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help the patient improve their sleep quality. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. **Cognitive Assessment:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to rule out <med>minor neurocognitive disorder</med> or other potential underlying conditions. This assessment can help identify specific areas of <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and guide targeted interventions.\n\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social networks and consider <med>support groups</med> for individuals experiencing <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Social support can play a crucial role in recovery and maintaining mental well-being.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure their safety. This ongoing support can help the patient navigate their journey towards recovery.",

      "predicted": "You've been enduring a significant amount of distress lately, and it's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed by various <sym>symptoms</sym> that have been affecting your daily life. You've expressed a persistent <sym>sense of hopelessness</sym>, accompanied by a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. This <sym>anhedonia</sym> is coupled with a heavy feeling of fatigue, despite sleeping for extended periods. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, with constant worries and occasional <sym>panic-like</sym> feelings. Cognitive struggles, such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and a general <sym>sense of detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, add to your burden. You've also whispered about feeling lost and uncertain about your identity and the value of your life. These feelings have led to a withdrawal from social interactions, leaving you feeling more isolated than ever.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major depressive disorder with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). The presence of <sym>anxious distress</sym> is evident through the patient's constant worries and occasional <sym>panic-like</sym> feelings. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as memory problems and a general <sym>sense of detachment</sym>, as well as <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, further support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms have been present for over three months, meeting the duration criterion for <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>. This type of therapy can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge distorted thoughts.\n\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or a primary care physician for an evaluation of medication options. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other <med>antidepressants</med> may be considered to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> to determine the patient's immediate safety and develop a safety plan. This may include removing access to lethal means, establishing a support network, and creating a crisis intervention plan.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help the patient improve their sleep quality. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. **Cognitive Assessment:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to rule out <med>minor neurocognitive disorder</med> or other potential underlying conditions. This assessment can help identify specific areas of <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and guide targeted interventions.\n\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social networks and consider <med>support groups</med> for individuals experiencing <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Social support can play a crucial role in recovery and maintaining mental well-being.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure their safety. This ongoing support can help the patient navigate their journey towards recovery.",
