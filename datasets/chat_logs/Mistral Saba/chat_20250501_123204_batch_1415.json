This assessment will help us identify areas that may be impacting your well-being. All your responses will be kept confidential, and it's important to be as honest as possible. This questionnaire comprises 23 questions. I will be asking each question one at a time, and I want to assure you that we will take this at your pace. Let's start.

Additionally, the presence of anxiety symptoms, such as worry and avoidance behaviors, suggests a potential comorbid anxiety disorder. The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic symptoms, which may be interrelated with the primary mood disturbance. The patient's feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation require immediate attention and close monitoring. The patient's social withdrawal and identity confusion further underscore the need for comprehensive psychological evaluation and intervention. Further assessment is warranted to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. It's clear that you've been going through a challenging time. You've described feeling persistently sad and hopeless, with a noticeable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming and isolating. You've expressed that you sometimes feel like you're just going through the motions, and that's a tough place to be. You also mentioned having <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is concerning, and it's important to address these thoughts. It's also concerning that you feel like your physical symptoms are not being taken seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder</med> (likely <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>), with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Insomnia</med> as potential comorbidities\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits a persistent pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym>, which aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> suggests potential comorbidities of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>) and <med>Insomnia</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is particularly concerning and warrants immediate attention. The patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> could be interrelated with the primary mood disturbance or indicative of a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Pharmacological Intervention</med>: Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic medication</med> to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. <med>Psychotherapy</med>: <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> can be effective in treating <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and address underlying issues.\n3. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med>: Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. <med>Safety Planning</med>: Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. <med>Collaboration with Primary Care Physician</med>: Ensure that the patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym> are being adequately addressed and ruled out for any underlying <med>medical conditions</med>.\n6. <med>Regular Follow-ups</med>: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n7. <med>Support System</med>: Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive friends and family, as social connections can be crucial for mental health recovery.",
