Main Symptoms and Concerns\n- Significant levels of anxiety, particularly in social situations, including panic episodes and avoidance behaviors.\n- Feelings of depression, characterized by periods of feeling down, especially after social situations.\n- Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling back asleep and racing thoughts.\n- Depersonalization/derealization symptoms, feeling detached or distant from oneself, especially in social settings.\n- Difficulty enjoying activities and feeling disconnected from others.\n- Preoccupation with perceived social failures and self-criticism.\n- No reported thoughts of self-harm or psychosis.\n\n#### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses\n- The patient consistently reports heightened anxiety and avoidance behaviors related to social interactions.\n- Sleep disturbances are linked to anxiety, particularly difficulty falling back asleep due to racing thoughts about social situations.\n- Feelings of depression and disconnection from others are prominent, often triggered by social engagement.\n- The patient does not report any psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, or behavioral compulsions.\n\n#### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): The patient's persistent anxiety, racing thoughts, and avoidance behaviors suggest a possible diagnosis of GAD.\n- Social Anxiety Disorder: The patient's specific anxiety around social situations, avoidance behaviors, and depersonalization indicate potential social anxiety.\n- Major Depressive Disorder: While the patient does not report feeling hopeless, the feelings of depression and disconnection warrant further exploration.\n- Possible Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: The patient experiences feelings of detachment from oneself, especially in social settings.\n\n#### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n- Avoidance behaviors could limit the patient's ability to engage in everyday activities and maintain relationships.\n- While not currently reporting suicidal thoughts, the patient's feelings of depression and disconnection are concerning for potential future risk.\n- Social isolation and avoidance behaviors could exacerbate symptoms and reduce the patient's support system.\n\n#### 5. Summary in Clinical Language\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, with a notable focus on social anxiety. Significant concerns include persistent anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors in social situations. Sleep disturbances, characterized by difficulty falling back asleep and racing thoughts about social situations, are also present. The patient experiences depersonalization/derealization symptoms, particularly in social settings, which may indicate a co-occurring Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. Feelings of depression and disconnection from others are reported, warranting further exploration for potential Major Depressive Disorder. The patient does not report any psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, or behavioral compulsions. Avoidance behaviors and feelings of depression could increase the risk of social isolation and exacerbate symptoms. Further evaluation and treatment planning should focus on addressing anxiety, improving social engagement, and managing sleep disturbances.",

Medication Review: Consult with a psychiatrist to review your current medications and discuss the possibility of adding an <med>anxiolytic</med> or <med>antidepressant</med> to manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n5.
