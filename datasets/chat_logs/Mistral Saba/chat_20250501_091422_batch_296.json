You've also been experiencing significant sleep disturbances, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. You've shared that you feel detached from yourself and your surroundings, and that you've withdrawn from social interactions. It's understandable that these experiences feel overwhelming and impact your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> further supports this diagnosis. The <sym>anxiety</sym> is pervasive and impacts the patient's ability to engage in social situations, which is consistent with <med>Anxiety</med>. The <sym>insomnia</sym> is both persistent and non-restorative, indicating a possible <med>Insomnia</med>. The patient's <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of identity</sym> could be associated with the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, but they also warrant consideration for <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The patient's <sym>uneasiness about not being taken seriously regarding medical concerns</sym> may reflect a component of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this is not the primary concern at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms, as well as any maladaptive thought patterns. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) could also be beneficial to address the patient's withdrawal from social interactions.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider starting <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) are a common first-line treatment for <med>MDD</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess the patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure a safety plan is in place. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal ideation.\n\n5. **Collaboration:** Work closely with the patient's primary care physician to address any <sym>uneasiness</sym> about medical concerns and to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Provide information about <med>MDD</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>insomnia</med> to help the patient understand their symptoms and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",

Symptoms include persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, increased irritability, and cognitive difficulties. The patient exhibits avoidance behaviors related to anxiety and social withdrawal, which may contribute to feelings of detachment and loss of identity. There is a history of physical complaints and occasional thoughts of self-harm without a concrete plan, which necessitates ongoing risk assessment. The patient does not engage in substance use or misuse of medications. Further exploration of somatic symptoms and their relationship to psychological distress is warranted. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as any underlying cognitive and dissociative symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a challenging time. You mentioned feeling down and hopeless, with a notable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing significant sleep disturbances, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. You've shared that you feel detached from yourself and your surroundings, and that you've withdrawn from social interactions. It's understandable that these experiences feel overwhelming and impact your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> further supports this diagnosis. The <sym>anxiety</sym> is pervasive and impacts the patient's ability to engage in social situations, which is consistent with <med>Anxiety</med>. The <sym>insomnia</sym> is both persistent and non-restorative, indicating a possible <med>Insomnia</med>. The patient's <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of identity</sym> could be associated with the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, but they also warrant consideration for <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The patient's <sym>uneasiness about not being taken seriously regarding medical concerns</sym> may reflect a component of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this is not the primary concern at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms, as well as any maladaptive thought patterns. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) could also be beneficial to address the patient's withdrawal from social interactions.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider starting <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) are a common first-line treatment for <med>MDD</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess the patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure a safety plan is in place. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal ideation.\n\n5. **Collaboration:** Work closely with the patient's primary care physician to address any <sym>uneasiness</sym> about medical concerns and to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Provide information about <med>MDD</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>insomnia</med> to help the patient understand their symptoms and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
