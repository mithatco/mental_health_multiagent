      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've been feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent sadness and hopelessness, and increased irritability. Sleep has been disrupted, with early morning awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep. You've also been experiencing increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, avoidance behaviors, unexplained physical symptoms like headaches and back pain, and dissociative experiences that leave you feeling detached from yourself. It's clear that these experiences have been taking a toll on your daily functioning and relationships. It's important to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings, and I'm here to support you as we navigate this together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, which are core features of <med>major depressive disorder</med> (<MDD>). The patient also exhibits <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, which suggest a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>unexplained physical symptoms</sym> and belief that their illnesses are not taken seriously indicate a <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>. The patient's feelings of detachment and loss of self-identity are concerning for <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The combination of these symptoms and the significant impairment in daily functioning supports the diagnosis of <MDD> with <anxiety> and <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Thorough Risk Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of suicidal risk due to the patient's reported <sym>thoughts of death</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<CBT>) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<IPT>) to address <MDD> and <anxiety> symptoms, and improve coping skills.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider refering the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <MDD> and <anxiety> symptoms.\n4. **Somatic Symptom Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> to rule out any underlying medical conditions and provide appropriate care.\n5. **Interpersonal Support:** Assess the patient's <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and provide recommendations for improving relationships and social support.\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <MDD>, <anxiety>, and <somatic symptom disorder> to help them understand their symptoms and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n7. **Follow-up Appointments:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
