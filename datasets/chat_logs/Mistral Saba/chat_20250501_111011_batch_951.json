Additional symptoms suggestive of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, such as persistent feelings of anxiety and worry, are also present. The patient reports occasional dissociative symptoms and somatic complaints, which may indicate a Somatic Symptom Disorder. The patient's recent divorce appears to be a significant stressor, potentially contributing to an Adjustment Disorder. The patient exhibits avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, which may exacerbate feelings of isolation and further mental health deterioration. There are no immediate risk factors for self-harm, but the presence of depressed mood and hopelessness warrants continued monitoring. The patient denies substance use, which is a positive indicator but does not mitigate the need for comprehensive mental health intervention.",

      "predicted": "It appears you've been going through a significant emotional turmoil since your divorce. You've been experiencing a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness, a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and increased irritability, which has strained your relationships with loved ones. Sleeping more than usual and feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings further indicate the depth of your emotional distress. You've also been avoiding stressful situations and questioning your identity, which seems to be contributing to a sense of isolation. Additionally, you've noticed some physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, which might be related to the stress you're experiencing. It's clear that you're facing substantial challenges, and it's commendable that you're seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for over two weeks, consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The patient also exhibits <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about the future, indicating a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The recent divorce serves as a significant stressor, and the symptoms do not meet criteria for <med>Adjustment Disorder</med> because they are severe enough to impair functioning. The patient does not exhibit the full criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as the physical symptoms are not the primary focus of concern and do not cause significant distress or impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym>.\n2. <med>Mindfulness and relaxation techniques</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>insomnia</med>.\n3. Referral to a <med>primary care physician</med> for a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical conditions contributing to <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>.\n4. <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help navigate the emotional impact of the divorce and improve social functioning.\n5. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust treatment as necessary.\n6. Consideration of <med>medication</med> if <sym>symptom</sym> severity persists despite psychotherapy.",
