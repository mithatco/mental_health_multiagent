      "predicted": "I understand that you've been going through a challenging time. You've expressed feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, along with difficulty finding pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. You've also shared struggles with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>memory</sym>, and <sym>identity</sym>, as well as feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and others. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are causing you significant distress and impacting your daily life. You've also mentioned <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, both of which are concerning and warrant immediate attention.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxious distress</sym> and <sym>obsessive-compulsive traits</sym>\n\n***Reasoning:*** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxious distress</sym> is evident through <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worries</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Additionally, <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym> such as <sym>handwashing</sym> and <sym>repetitive checking</sym> suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits. The <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>identity disturbance</sym> could be related to the depressive episode, but further exploration is needed to rule out other <med>dissociative disorders</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>feelings of not being taken seriously</sym> do not sufficiently warrant a diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time, but should be monitored. The <sym>cognitive issues</sym> could be related to the depressive episode or may require further evaluation for potential <med>neurocognitive disorders</med>.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</med>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>. <med>CBT</med> has been shown to be effective in treating <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial for treating both <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough suicide risk assessment is essential. Develop a safety plan and ensure the patient has access to support resources.\n\n5. **Psychological Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive psychological evaluation to assess for any potential <med>neurocognitive disorders</med> or other underlying conditions that may be contributing to the <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with their support system, including friends, family, or support groups, to help them feel less <sym>isolated</sym> and more connected to others.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, reassess <sym>symptoms</sym>, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
