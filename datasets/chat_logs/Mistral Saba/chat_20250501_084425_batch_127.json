It's clear that you've been going through a lot, and it's important to address these feelings and behaviors to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (<med>MDD</med>) with <med>Anxiety</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>) traits, and <med>Insomnia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your reported <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> (<quote>I've been feeling a bit like I'm going through the motions...

Additionally, your descriptions of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors (<quote>I've felt like I'm always on edge...

Furthermore, your difficulty falling asleep (<quote>I have a hard time falling asleep</quote>) points to <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Engage in <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> traits. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Review**: Consult with a psychiatrist to review your current medications and consider the addition of <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. A <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SSRI</med>) could be beneficial for both <med>depression</med> and <med>OCD</med> traits.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement good sleep hygiene practices to improve your sleep quality. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment.\n4. **Support Groups**: Consider joining support groups for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to connect with others who share similar experiences and gain additional coping strategies.\n5. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.

      "predicted": "I understand how challenging it has been for you lately. You've shared that you've been feeling a bit disconnected from things you used to enjoy, experiencing moments of deep sadness and hopelessness, and feeling constantly on edge. You've also mentioned having intrusive thoughts, engaging in repetitive behaviors like excessive hand-washing, and struggling to connect with others. It's clear that you've been going through a lot, and it's important to address these feelings and behaviors to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (<med>MDD</med>) with <med>Anxiety</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>) traits, and <med>Insomnia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your reported <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> (<quote>I've been feeling a bit like I'm going through the motions... I've felt distant from people lately</quote>), you meet the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your descriptions of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors (<quote>I've felt like I'm always on edge... I try to, but it's hard</quote>) align with <med>Anxiety</med> symptoms. The repetitive behaviors, such as excessive hand-washing and checking, (<quote>I wash my hands a lot or check things repeatedly</quote>) suggest <med>OCD</med> traits. Furthermore, your difficulty falling asleep (<quote>I have a hard time falling asleep</quote>) points to <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Engage in <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> traits. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Review**: Consult with a psychiatrist to review your current medications and consider the addition of <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. A <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SSRI</med>) could be beneficial for both <med>depression</med> and <med>OCD</med> traits.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement good sleep hygiene practices to improve your sleep quality. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment.\n4. **Support Groups**: Consider joining support groups for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to connect with others who share similar experiences and gain additional coping strategies.\n5. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. This can help ensure you are receiving the appropriate level of care and support.",
