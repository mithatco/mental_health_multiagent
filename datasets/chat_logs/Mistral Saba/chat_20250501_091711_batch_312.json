      "predicted": "It is evident that you have been through a significant and distressing event, and the aftermath has left you feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from your former self. Your <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> suggest that you are struggling with the emotional impact of the accident. Furthermore, your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> indicate that you are grappling with <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>), <med>major depressive disorder</med>, and possibly <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, your reliance on alcohol to manage sleep highlights a potential <med>substance use disorder</med>. Your feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from social interactions and <sym>identity uncertainty</sym> further underscore the profound impact of your experiences. It's important to acknowledge the courage it takes to seek help and the strength it takes to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your reported <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym> align with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to the accident are consistent with <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med>. Your persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic symptoms</med> indicate a possible diagnosis of <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The use of alcohol to aid sleep, coupled with the reported amount, suggests a developing <med>substance use disorder</med>. Your feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity uncertainty</sym> are consistent with the emotional and cognitive disturbances often seen in these conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address symptoms of <med>PTSD</med>, <med>major depressive disorder</med>, and <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. Trauma-focused therapies, such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (<med>EMDR</med>), may also be beneficial.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to explore the use of <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med> and <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. For <med>PTSD</med>, <med>trauma-focused therapies</med> may be first-line treatment; however, a psychiatrist may also consider <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anti-anxiety medications</med> as part of the treatment plan.\n3. **Substance Use Intervention:** Work with an addiction specialist to address <med>alcohol use disorder</med>. This may include behavioral therapies and support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (<med>AA</med>).\n4. **Support Network:** Reconnect with friends and family, even if it feels difficult at first. Social support can be crucial in managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Consider joining a support group for individuals who have experienced trauma.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve sleep quality. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>caffeine</sym> close to bedtime.\n6. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments with a mental health professional to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
