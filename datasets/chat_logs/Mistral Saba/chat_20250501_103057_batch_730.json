      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness and honesty as we discussed your experiences over the past two weeks. It's clear that you've been struggling with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, which have significantly impacted your daily life. You've described feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, and you've been experiencing <sym>sleep difficulties</sym> and <sym>memory issues</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, as well as <sym>uneasiness</sym> about your physical health. It's understandable that these <symptoms> have led you to feel <quote>lost</quote> and disconnected from others.\n\n***Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features\n\n***Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> for over two weeks, which meets the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>feeling on edge</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, which support the diagnosis of <med>Anxiety</med> features. The patient's <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>detachment</sym> further support the diagnosis. The patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> also warrant attention, although they deny intent to act on them. There is no evidence of <med>Psychotic</med> features or <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health disorders</med>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n5. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> severity and treatment progress, and to adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym>.\n7. **Self-Care:** Recommend self-care strategies, such as gentle exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and improve overall well-being.",
