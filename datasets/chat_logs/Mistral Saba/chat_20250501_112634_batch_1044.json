Your responses will be kept confidential, and this assessment will help us understand what you're going through in more detail. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to rate how much you've been bothered by each problem over the past two weeks. Let's begin."

Co-occurring depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, depressed mood, and feelings of hopelessness, suggest a possible Major Depressive Disorder. Generalized anxiety is evident through constant worry and avoidance behaviors. The patient\u2019s sleep disturbances and use of alcohol as a sleep aid indicate potential sleep disorder and substance use concerns. The patient\u2019s functional impairment, increased substance use, and desire to return to normalcy highlight significant impairment in daily functioning and the need for comprehensive intervention.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a lot lately. You described feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> almost every day since a recent accident, and you mentioned having <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> you used to enjoy. You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> frequently, especially when reminded of the accident. Your <sym>sleep</sym> has been disrupted, with frequent awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, which you've been trying to manage with increased alcohol consumption. You mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, and avoiding certain places and activities that remind you of the accident. I appreciate your openness in sharing these challenges, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>), <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>), and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your responses, you exhibit several <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with <med>PTSD</med>, including intrusive thoughts about the accident, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, <sym>hyperarousal</sym>, and <sym>dissociative</sym> symptoms. Additionally, your report of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggests a co-occurring <med>MDD</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and use of alcohol to aid sleep indicate a possible <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>back pain</sym>, and <sym>tension</sym> you experience may be related to the stress and anxiety you've been dealing with, but they are not indicative of <med>Somatoform Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Referral to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.\n2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for <med>PTSD</med> (<med>Prolonged Exposure Therapy</med> or <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy</med>), which is effective in treating <sym>PTSD symptoms</sym>.\n3. Medication management for <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>), to help manage <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Sleep hygiene education and potential pharmacotherapy for <med>sleep disturbances</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia</med> (<med>CBT-I</med>).\n5. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.\n6. Encourage open communication about any <sym>substance use</sym> and provide education on the risks of self-medicating with alcohol.\n7. Support for family and friends to understand and cope with your <sym>symptoms</sym> and the changes in your behavior.",
