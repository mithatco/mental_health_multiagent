Further evaluation and follow-up are necessary to monitor and manage potential risks, particularly related to suicidal ideation and social withdrawal.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>physical discomfort</sym> lately. You've described feeling <quote>down, depressed, and hopeless</quote>, with a <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy. It's not easy to carry the weight of these feelings, and it's understandable that you might feel <quote>empty and like nothing really matters</quote>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> you're experiencing can also be quite challenging. It's important to recognize that these are valid concerns and deserve attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. These include <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>. The patient reports feeling <quote>down, depressed, and hopeless</quote>, describes a <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities, and experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as early morning awakenings and <sym>difficulty falling back asleep</sym>. Additionally, the patient mentions occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is a significant indicator of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>cognitive</sym> <sym>difficulties</sym>, such as <quote>memory problems</quote> and <quote>feeling foggy</quote>, further supports this diagnosis. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is a consideration due to the <sym>persistent physical discomfort</sym>, the current presentation is more indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve their mood and functioning.\n\n2. **Medication:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depression</sym>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Management:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices and consider referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> if necessary. This can help address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and improve overall <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n\n4. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Provide resources or referrals for <med>cognitive rehabilitation</med> to address <sym>cognitive difficulties</med>, such as memory problems and <sym>brain fog</sym>.\n\n5. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> to ensure the patient's safety. Develop a safety plan and monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely.\n\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support networks and consider <med>family therapy</med> or <med>group therapy</med> to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
