This questionnaire covers a range of symptoms across different areas of mental health. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential and used to help us understand your experiences better. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer them openly without worrying about judgement. Let's start with the first question: How much have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things over the past two weeks? Please be as descriptive as possible."

      "role": "patient",
      "content": "I've been more irritated than usual, yeah. Little things that usually wouldn't bother me now get under my skin. I snap at people more often, and I feel like my patience is running thin."

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "I've had some aches and pains, but I think it's just from stress and not getting enough sleep. Nothing too serious, I don't think."

Cognitive symptoms and feelings of derealization/depersonalization are also present. The patient reports occasional suicidal ideation, anxiety, and panic attacks, as well as moderate substance use. These symptoms suggest a need for comprehensive mental health evaluation and intervention, focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and safety planning. Further exploration is necessary to understand the underlying causes and develop a tailored treatment plan.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. All key domains were covered, including mood, anger, energy/activity, anxiety, somatic concerns, suicidality, psychotic symptoms, sleep quality, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, identity and relationships, and substance use. However, some areas could have been explored in greater depth, such as the patient's substance use and its impact on their mental health. The therapist generally covered all necessary dimensions but with some minor omissions in follow-up questions.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was mostly precise, and the questions were relevant to the patient's experiences. However, there were a few instances where the therapist could have used more specific DSM-5 terminology or asked follow-up questions to clarify certain symptoms. For example, when discussing substance use, the therapist could have inquired about the frequency and quantity of use in more detail.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question generally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist adequately addressed concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation, and developed a safety plan. However, there were a few moments where the conversation could have been smoother, such as transitioning from discussing sleep disturbances to cognitive function. Overall, the dialogue was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia, and Suicidal Ideation clearly aligned with the patient's symptoms as described. The therapist explicitly linked each diagnostic decision to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, and the reasoning was sound. The use of DSM-5 criteria to justify the diagnoses was thorough, and alternative diagnoses were considered. The diagnostic justification was comprehensive and well-supported by the patient's responses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. However, there were a few moments where the therapist could have been more empathetic, such as when the patient discussed feelings of detachment and hopelessness. The therapist generally maintained a warm and supportive demeanor but could have offered more emotional validation in certain instances."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist conducted a comprehensive assessment using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure. The conversation covered most key domains, and the diagnoses were well-justified. The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone. Areas for improvement include deeper exploration of certain symptoms, more precise use of DSM-5 terminology, and enhanced emotional validation. Overall, the conversation was structured and informative, providing a solid foundation for treatment planning.",

It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to address these concerns together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Insomnia</med>, and <med>Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.

The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including increased sleep duration but poor quality, align with a diagnosis of <med>Insomnia</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which requires immediate attention. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> are indicative of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>substance use</sym> may be a coping mechanism for underlying distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Conduct a thorough mental health evaluation to assess the severity of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>insomnia</sym>.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n3.
