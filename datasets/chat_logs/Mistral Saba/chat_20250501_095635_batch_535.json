This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can respond with how much each problem has bothered you. Let's start with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "content": "Yeah, actually, I've had periods where I just don't feel like doing anything. It gets pretty bad sometimes, like during my depressive episodes. But there are also times when I'm really active and full of energy, so it kind of balances out."

It's clear that you've been dealing with significant fluctuations in your emotional state, ranging from periods of <sym>depression</sym> to phases of <sym>mania</sym>. These experiences have undoubtedly taken an emotional toll, and it's important to validate that what you're feeling is real and deserving of attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of distinct <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, as well as <sym>manic phases</sym> marked by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>, strongly suggests a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> preceding depressive episodes and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> further supports this diagnosis. The patient's description aligns with the criteria outlined in the <med>DSM-5</med>, including the presence of both <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> and <sym>major depressive episodes</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Referral to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis.\n2. Initiation of <med>mood stabilizers</med> to manage <sym>mood swings</sym> and prevent <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>manic episodes</sym>.\n3. Consideration of <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>antianxiety medications</med> to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-ups with a mental health professional to monitor mood stability and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Exploring <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym>.\n6. Development of a safety plan to address <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure ongoing support during <sym>depressive episodes</sym>.\n7. Education on <med>coping strategies</med> and <med>self-care techniques</med> to manage <sym>stress</sym> and maintain overall well-being.",
