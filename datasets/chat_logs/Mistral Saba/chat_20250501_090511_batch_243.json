This measure is designed to help us identify areas that may be affecting your well-being. Your answers will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. We will go through 23 questions, and you can answer each one based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Let's begin with the first question."

The patient reports a lack of interest and pleasure in activities, feelings of depression, irritability, anxiety, intrusive thoughts related to a past accident, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances, feelings of dissociation, identity disturbance, and interpersonal isolation are also prominent. These symptoms indicate a complex interplay of emotional dysregulation, cognitive impairment, and interpersonal difficulties. The absence of current suicidal ideation is reassuring, but caution is warranted given the risk factors present. Further evaluation and treatment should focus on trauma-informed care, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and possibly medication management to address both the trauma and depressive symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through an incredibly challenging time since the accident. You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you once enjoyed, feel persistently down and hopeless, and have been experiencing significant irritability and anxiety, particularly around reminders of the traumatic event. The way you're describing these feelings, it seems like they've taken a toll on your sleep, your sense of self, and your relationships. It's understandable that you've been avoiding certain situations that trigger these feelings, and it's important to acknowledge the bravery it took to share all of this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> with symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of a traumatic event, along with symptoms of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, <sym>negative alterations in cognitions and mood</sym>, and <sym>arousal</sym> (re-experiencing the accident, irritability, avoidance of driving and cars, feelings of disconnection, and anxiety), strongly suggests a <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> indicates a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's description of <quote>feeling like I'm just going through the motions</quote> and <quote>nothing really interests me anymore</quote> supports this diagnosis. While the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, the severity of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> warrants consideration of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> focusing on <med>Trauma-Focused CBT</med> to address <sym>PTSD</sym> symptoms. This can help the patient process the trauma and develop coping strategies.\n\n2. <med>Pharmacological intervention</med> such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> to manage symptoms of both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene education</med> and potentially <med>sleep medication</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. Improving sleep can have a positive impact on both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n4. <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym>. This can help the patient reconnect with others and rebuild relationships.\n\n5. <med>Regular follow-up appointments</med> to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
