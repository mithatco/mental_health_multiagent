Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - Persistent depressive symptoms: Lack of interest in previously enjoyable activities (A1), feeling down and hopeless (A2), and difficulty initiating daily tasks (A5).\n   - Anxiety and panic: Frequent feelings of nervousness, worry, and panic (A6), with several panic attacks characterized by racing heart, sweating, and feelings of losing control (A7).\n   - Avoidance behaviors: Avoids situations that trigger anxiety, including crowded places and leaving the house (A8).\n   - Sleep disturbances: Excessive sleep with persistent feelings of exhaustion (A4), frequent night awakenings, and restless sleep (A14).\n   - Cognitive and emotional disruptions: Recurrent thoughts about panic attacks (A16), feelings of detachment during panic attacks (A18), and uncertainty about personal identity (A19).\n   - Social withdrawal: Withdrawal from friends and family, feeling disconnected from relationships (A20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n   - Consistent themes of difficulty engaging in daily activities and relationships.\n   - Recurrent physical symptoms, including stomachaches and headaches, though not constant.\n   - A clear association between anxiety symptoms and avoidance behaviors.\n   - Marked sleep disturbances, which may exacerbate other symptoms.\n   - A sense of disconnection or depersonalization during panic attacks.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - Major Depressive Disorder (recurrent thoughts of hopelessness, lack of pleasure, fatigue).\n   - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (constant worry, avoidance behaviors).\n   - Panic Disorder (recurrent panic attacks, avoidance of triggering situations).\n   - Possible Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (feelings of detachment, loss of control).\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n   - Frequent panic attacks, which can escalate into more severe mental health issues if not addressed.\n   - Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection, which may lead to further isolation and exacerbation of symptoms.\n   - Sleep disturbances, which can worsen both depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder, likely accompanied by Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal further emphasize the severity of the anxiety component. Cognitive and emotional disruptions, including recurrent thoughts about panic attacks and feelings of depersonalization, suggest a potentially debilitating impact on the patient's overall functioning. Sleep disturbances appear to be a significant factor in exacerbating the patient's condition. The patient denies substance use, which is a positive factor. Given the severity and complexity of the symptoms, a comprehensive treatment plan addressing both depressive and anxiety components, along with sleep hygiene interventions, is recommended.",

      "predicted": "It's clear from your responses that you've been navigating a very challenging time, feeling a profound lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed, persistent sadness, and a sense of hopelessness. You've shared that you're experiencing frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which have led to significant <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings have also affected your sleep and your ability to connect with others. You've also mentioned <sym>recurrent thoughts</sym> about these experiences, which can be quite distressing. It's important to acknowledge the courage it took to share these experiences, and I'm here to help you find a path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>Single Episode, Severe</med>), <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent lack of interest in activities, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequency and severity of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> suggest <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are a significant factor, warranting consideration of a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>recurrent thoughts</sym> about panic attacks and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> during these episodes further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. This approach can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Management:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and duration. This may include techniques such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>panic disorder</med> and <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n6. **Collaboration with Primary Care:** Collaborate with the patient's primary care physician to address <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and rule out any medical causes of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, or <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.",
