You've shared feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>disconnection</sym> from both activities you used to enjoy and the people around you. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>physical discomfort</sym>, and even <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, although you assure me these are not with intent to act on them. It's important to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>negative thoughts</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<MDD>). The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests co-occurring <med>anxiety</med> features. The patient's <sym>physical complaints</sym> may be <sym>somatoform</sym> in nature, potentially exacerbated by the psychological distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Initiate <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<CBT>), to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>medication management</med> with a psychiatrist to explore the use of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications.\n4. Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>daytime fatigue</sym>.\n5. Encourage engagement in social activities and support networks to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>.\n6. Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n7. Regularly monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's response to interventions.",
