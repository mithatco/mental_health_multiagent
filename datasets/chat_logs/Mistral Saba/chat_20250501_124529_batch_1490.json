Let's work together to find some ways to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxiety, with <sym>mild cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depression</sym>, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, including memory difficulties and intrusive thoughts, suggest a <med>mild neurocognitive disorder</med>. Additionally, the occasional use of alcohol, tobacco, and painkillers without a prescription indicates <med>substance use</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the severity of the patient's distress and the need for immediate intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. This evidence-based treatment can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. A thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist is recommended to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage.\n3. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's <med>substance use</med> to determine the extent of use and potential <med>substance use disorder</med>. Provide education on the risks of self-medication and offer support for cessation if warranted.\n4. **Cognitive Assessment:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to assess the severity of <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and rule out other potential causes.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive relationships and consider involving family or friends in the treatment process. Support groups for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> can also be beneficial.\n6. **Self-Care:** Recommend regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep to support overall well-being. Encourage the patient to engage in activities they used to enjoy, even if they don't feel motivated initially.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatments as needed, and ensure the patient's safety.",
