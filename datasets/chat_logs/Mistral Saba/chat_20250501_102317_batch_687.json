The patient's symptoms, such as excessive worry, restlessness, avoidance behaviors, panic attacks, and somatic symptoms, are also consistent with anxiety. However, it's worth noting that the diagnosis also includes Major Depressive Disorder and Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, which may complicate the primary presentation of anxiety.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. You've shared that you're experiencing a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness, and increased irritability. Sleep has been difficult for you, and you're constantly feeling nervous and on edge. You've also mentioned <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms like a racing heart and shortness of breath, as well as <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> due to anxiety. Additionally, you've felt detached from yourself and others, and you're struggling with <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like muscle tension and stomachaches. It sounds like you're going through a lot, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> for over two weeks, indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's feelings of detachment from oneself and surroundings align with the criteria for <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>. The patient does not report <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, making <med>Psychotic Disorder</med> less likely. While the patient reports <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, they are not the primary concern and do not meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as they do not cause disproportionate distress or impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Referral to a <med>Mental Health Professional</med>:** For a comprehensive evaluation and to establish a formal diagnosis.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive thoughts</sym>, and to develop coping strategies.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consideration of <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** To educate the patient about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>depersonalization</med>, and to normalize their experiences.\n5. **Regular Check-ins:** To monitor <sym>symptom</sym> severity and adjust treatment as needed.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a support network.",
