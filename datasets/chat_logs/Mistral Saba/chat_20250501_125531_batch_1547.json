      "predicted": "I've listened carefully to your experiences, and I want to acknowledge the challenges you've been facing. It sounds like you've been feeling a significant reduction in interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, particularly in social situations. You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with moments of intense anxiety and panic before social events. You've also mentioned avoiding social situations and feeling detached from yourself and others. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pattern of persistent and excessive fear in one or more situations involving social interaction or performance, leading to significant impairment or distress. The patient reports significant anxiety and avoidance in social situations, consistent with <sym>social anxiety</sym>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of depression</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, particularly in social contexts, which suggests a comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> further support the diagnosis. The patient's <quote>I just want to escape from everything</quote> and <quote>I feel like I don't fit in anywhere and I don't know what I want out of life</quote> indicate a need for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss treatment options.\n2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, focusing on cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy for <sym>social anxiety</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n4. Psychopharmacological evaluation to consider medications such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for <med>MDD</med> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.",
