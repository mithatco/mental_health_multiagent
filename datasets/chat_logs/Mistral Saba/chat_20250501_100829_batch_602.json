This assessment will help us identify areas that need further exploration and track changes in how you're feeling. Please be assured that everything you share will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll be asking one at a time. Let's begin. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

It's clear that you're struggling with these <sym>mood swings</sym>, and it's important to address them to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a clear pattern of oscillating between <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>decreased energy</sym>, and <sym>manic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive, risky behavior</sym>. These symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>, which are common in <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient denies <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, which, if present, could indicate a different diagnosis.

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been experiencing significant <sym>mood swings</sym> that have been affecting your daily life. You've described periods of <sym>depression</sym>, where you feel down, hopeless, and disconnected from yourself and others, as well as periods of <sym>mania</sym>, where you have increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and engage in risky behaviors. These fluctuations have been causing you distress and impacting your relationships. It's clear that you're struggling with these <sym>mood swings</sym>, and it's important to address them to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a clear pattern of oscillating between <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>decreased energy</sym>, and <sym>manic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive, risky behavior</sym>. These symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>, which are common in <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient denies <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, which, if present, could indicate a different diagnosis. The patient's <sym>fleetings thoughts of death</sym> during <sym>depressive episodes</sym> also warrant careful monitoring, although they do not currently indicate a severe risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med>, such as <med>lithium</med> or <med>valproic acid</med>, to manage <sym>mood swings</sym>. <med>Antidepressants</med> may also be prescribed during <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, but should be used cautiously to avoid triggering a <sym>manic episode</sym>.\n3. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with education about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help them understand their condition and develop coping strategies.\n4. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Refer the patient to a therapist for <med>CBT</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, medication effectiveness, and any potential side effects.\n6. **Substance Abuse Screening:** Continue to monitor the patient's substance use, as <sym>substance abuse</sym> can exacerbate <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> symptoms.\n7. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to build and maintain a strong support system, as social connections can help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>manic symptoms</sym>.\n8. **Educate About Triggers:** Help the patient identify <sym>triggers</sym> for <sym>manic</sym> and <sym>depressive episodes</sym> to develop an <med>early warning system</med> and <med>relapse prevention plan</med>.",
