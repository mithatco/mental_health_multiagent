This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and identify any areas that might need further exploration. Please know that our conversation is confidential, and I'm here to support you. We'll go through 23 questions, and you'll rate each based on how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question. Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Patient's symptoms significantly impact their daily functioning and interpersonal relationships. Further evaluation and treatment planning should focus on addressing these primary mental health concerns, as well as the patient's substance use, to improve overall functioning and well-being. A thorough assessment of the patient's suicidal ideation and risk factors is warranted.",

All critical domains such as depression, anxiety, and substance use were covered. However, the therapist could have explored the domains of 'mania' and 'repetitive thoughts and behaviors' more thoroughly. The conversation skipped directly to conclusions without fully detailing each dimension for the patient.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the language used was slightly vague or not precisely aligned with clinical terminology. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist did not specify the context of 'but still have a lot of energy,' which could have led to a more accurate assessment of mania symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few abrupt transitions, such as moving from discussing 'dissociative symptoms' to 'substance use' without a clear link. The therapist could have used more transitional phrases to connect the ideas.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided clear diagnostic justification, explicitly linking the patient's symptoms to DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Substance-related and Addictive Disorders. The reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was well-articulated and clinically sound.",
