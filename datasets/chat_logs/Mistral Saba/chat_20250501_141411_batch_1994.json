        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist systematically addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language. The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way that allowed for a clear understanding of the patient's symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's suicidal ideation and substance use. The conversation had a smooth transition and a coherent conversational arc, making it easy to follow and understand.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, GAD, and MDD. The diagnostic conclusions directly cite specific symptoms, and there is evidence of comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration. The justification for the diagnoses is transparent and based on the patient's reported symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses show consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. The interactions were warm, personalized, and supportive, creating a safe and non-judgmental space for the patient to share their experiences."
