This assessment will help us understand how you're feeling and any challenges you might be facing. Your responses will be kept confidential, and this session is a safe space for you to share openly. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll start with the first one. How have you been feeling about your interest in doing activities or hobbies you used to enjoy? Have you noticed any changes in the past two weeks?"
