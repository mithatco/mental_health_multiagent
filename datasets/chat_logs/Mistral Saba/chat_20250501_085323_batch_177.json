Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports significant periods of anhedonia (Q2), feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness (Q3), and difficulty with social relationships (Q20, Q21). These symptoms are associated with major depressive episodes.\n- **Manic Symptoms:** The patient experiences periods of decreased need for sleep with increased energy (Q5), increased goal-directed activity or agitation (Q6), and irritability (Q4), consistent with hypomanic or manic episodes.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient reports feelings of nervousness, worry, and anxiety (Q7), particularly in anticipation of depressive episodes.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient experiences both insomnia (Q5) and hypersomnia (Q15), which are common in bipolar disorder.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** The patient reports difficulties with memory and concentration (Q16) during depressive episodes.\n- **Deppersonalization/Derealization:** The patient feels detached or distant from themselves, their body, and their surroundings (Q19).\n- **Identity Disturbance:** The patient feels unsure about their identity and life goals (Q20).\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- **Bipolar Pattern:** The patient's responses indicate a cyclical pattern of depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms, consistent with a bipolar disorder.\n- **Intermittent Symptoms:** Symptoms fluctuate with periods of mania characterized by increased energy and irritability, and periods of depression marked by anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** The patient reports somatic symptoms such as headaches and back pain (Q10), which may be exacerbated during depressive episodes.\n- **Avoidant Behavior:** The patient tends to avoid social situations during depressive episodes (Q9).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Bipolar Disorder:** The patient's description of cycling between depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes is highly suggestive of bipolar disorder.\n- **Anxiety:** Persistent anxiety, particularly in anticipation of depressive episodes, may indicate co-occurring anxiety disorders.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient's discontinuation of prescribed antidepressants due to adverse effects (Q24) indicates a need for careful medication management.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports passive suicidal ideation, although not currently at imminent risk (Q12).\n- **Substance Use:** Although the patient does not report current substance use, the history of medication non-adherence due to adverse effects is concerning.\n- **Isolation:** The tendency to withdraw from social interactions during depressive episodes may exacerbate depressive symptoms and increase the risk of relapse.\n\n**5. Summary:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms consistent with bipolar disorder, including cycling between depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes. Depression is characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment. Manic episodes are marked by decreased need for sleep, increased energy, and irritability. The patient also reports anxiety, particularly in anticipation of depressive episodes, and has a history of antidepressant non-adherence due to adverse effects. The patient does not currently exhibit active suicidal intent but has passive suicidal ideation. There is a need for careful management of medications and monitoring of symptoms to prevent relapse and ensure adherence to treatment.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing significant fluctuations in your mood and energy levels, which has taken a toll on your daily life and relationships. You've described periods of intense <sym>depression</sym>, where you feel <sym>hopeless</sym>, struggle with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and find it difficult to connect with others. These episodes are punctuated by times of elevated mood and energy, during which you may engage in impulsive and risky behavior. You've also mentioned experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> during your depressive phases. It's understandable that these fluctuations can be exhausting and isolating.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> Type II, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n***Reasoning:*** The cyclical pattern of depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes reported by the patient is characteristic of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as decreased need for sleep, increased energy, and irritability, along with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal, strongly suggests a <med>Bipolar II</med> diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly in anticipation of depressive episodes, indicates a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's history of medication non-adherence due to adverse effects is also notable and may contribute to symptom management challenges.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mood disorders</med>.\n2. **Mood Stabilizer:** Consider a mood stabilizer such as <med>Lithium</med> or <med>Valproic Acid</med> to manage the bipolar symptoms. Monitor closely for adverse effects and ensure adherence.\n3. **Anti-Anxiety Medication:** A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) may be prescribed to manage <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, starting at a low dose to monitor for potential mood destabilization.\n4. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient develop coping strategies for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, as well as improve insight into their <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>.\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system understand the condition and its management.\n6. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Encourage regular sleep hygiene, a balanced diet, and gentle exercise to support overall mental health and mood stabilization.\n7. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptoms, medication effectiveness, and potential side effects, adjusting the treatment plan as needed.\n8. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the history of passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct regular assessments and implement a safety plan to mitigate risks.",
