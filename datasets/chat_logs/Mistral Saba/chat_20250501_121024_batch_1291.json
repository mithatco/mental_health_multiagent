      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've described feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. You've also been struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, which has led to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're seeking help. Let's work together to address these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent and excessive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about a variety of events or activities ( Generalized Anxiety Disorder), including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> indicates a Major Depressive Disorder. Additionally, the patient's <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> during panic attacks may suggest a dissociative component, which can accompany <med>anxiety disorders</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Engage in <med>CBT</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. This therapeutic approach can help you identify and change thought patterns and behaviors that are causing distress.\n\n2. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Incorporate mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</med>.\n\n3. **Medication Review:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss the possibility of <med>pharmacological interventions</med> for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve sleep quality. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. **Gradual Exposure Therapy:** Implement <med>exposure therapy</med> to gradually confront and manage <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. This can help you regain control over your environment and reduce <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n6. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n\n7. **Social Support:** Encourage reconnecting with social activities and relationships. Support from friends and family can be crucial in managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Consider support groups for individuals with similar experiences.",
