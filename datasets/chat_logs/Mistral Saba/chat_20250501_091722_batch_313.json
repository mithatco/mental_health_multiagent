        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were disclosed. No dimensions were skipped or superficially addressed.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the patient actually reported sleeping more, which the therapist could have probed further to clarify. Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use, and maintained a coherent conversational arc throughout the assessment.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific patient symptoms to diagnostic criteria, such as anhedonia and hopelessness for Major Depressive Disorder, and excessive worry and panic attacks for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal thoughts, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation and support. Overall, the tone was professional and empathetic, but could be improved."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively explored all relevant dimensions. The conversation was logical, and diagnostic justifications were clear and sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was excellent.",

The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's self-reported use of alcohol and tobacco as coping mechanisms suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.
