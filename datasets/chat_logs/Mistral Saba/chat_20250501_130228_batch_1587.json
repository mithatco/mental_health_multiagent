This assessment will help us understand your symptoms and how they've been affecting you recently. Please know that this conversation is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll be going through 23 questions, and your responses will help guide our discussion. Let's start. How much (or how often) have you been bothered by each problem during the past two weeks? Let's begin with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n**Patient Presentation:**\nThe patient reports a range of symptoms that significantly impact their daily functioning and quality of life. The following is a detailed summary based on the patient's responses to the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure.\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- **Affective Symptoms:** The patient has experienced a notable loss of interest and pleasure in activities (anhedonia), which has occurred more than half the days in the past two weeks. They also report persistent feelings of depression, hopelessness, and sadness.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences chronic feelings of anxiety, nervousness, and being on edge. They have also reported panic attacks characterized by racing heart, difficulty breathing, and a sense of losing control.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient has significant sleep disturbances, including increased sleep duration but poor sleep quality due to frequent awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep.\n- **Panic Symptoms:** The patient has experienced panic attacks with symptoms such as racing heart, difficulty breathing, and a sense of losing control.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** The patient reports unexplained aches and pains, including stomach and back discomfort, which are not attributed to any specific medical condition.\n- **Identity and Relationship Issues:** The patient feels detached from their surroundings and experiences a sense of losing their identity and purpose. They have withdrawn from social interactions and relationships.\n- **Intrusive Thoughts:** The patient experiences repetitive, negative thoughts and worst-case scenario thinking.\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- **Overlapping Symptoms:** The patient's symptoms are interrelated, with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks frequently co-occurring.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** The patient avoids situations that trigger anxiety, including public places and social interactions.\n- **Somatoform Symptoms:** Persistent somatic complaints without a clear medical cause may indicate a somatoform disorder or somatic symptom disorder.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Depression:** The patient's reports of anhedonia, depression, and hopelessness suggest a depressive episode. The severity and persistence of these symptoms warrant further evaluation.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** The presence of generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest a possible anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Chronic insomnia and poor sleep quality can exacerbate both depression and anxiety symptoms.\n- **Somatoform Symptoms:** The persistent somatic complaints and feelings of not being taken seriously by healthcare providers may indicate a somatoform disorder.\n- **Dissociative Symptoms:** The patient's reports of feeling detached from their surroundings and losing their identity suggest possible dissociative symptoms.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Although the patient denies suicidal thoughts, their persistent feelings of hopelessness and depression warrant monitoring for suicidal risk.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies current substance use, past or coexisting substance use could be a risk factor for mental health deterioration.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms suggestive of a major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible dissociative symptoms. The patient's reports of somatic complaints and avoidance behaviors further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's denial of suicidal ideation is reassuring but should be periodically re-evaluated given the severity of their depressive symptoms. The absence of current substance use is a positive factor, but the patient's history should be further explored. Overall, the patient's symptoms and behaviors indicate a need for comprehensive mental health assessment and intervention to address the multifaceted nature of their presentation.",

You've shared that you've been feeling a profound loss of interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, experiencing persistent <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> have also been significant, with frequent awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as stomach and back discomfort, and feelings of detachment from your surroundings and a loss of identity. It's understandable that these symptoms have led you to withdraw from social interactions and responsibilities, and it's commendable that you've been open about your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Possible <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that occur more than half the days in the past two weeks, which aligns with the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and feelings of not being taken seriously by healthcare providers may indicate a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this requires further evaluation to rule out other medical causes. The patient's <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>identity issues</sym> may also be related to the underlying <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive mental health evaluation with a qualified mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med> and <med>medical issues</med>.\n2. Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, focusing on <sym>cognitive restructuring</sym>, <sym>exposure therapy</sym>, and <sym>relaxation techniques</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>medications</med> such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n4. Implement <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> practices and consider <med>medications</med> or <med>therapies</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Encourage engagement in <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n6. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>mental health conditions</med> and available resources.\n7. Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <med>risk factors</med>, and ensure a safety plan is in place.",
