The presence of anhedonia, irritability, and suicidal ideation are particularly concerning. The patient also exhibits signs of generalized anxiety, potential dissociative symptoms, and social withdrawal. These symptoms warrant a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and potential referral for more intensive mental health services. The patient's lack of substance use and past tobacco cessation are positive factors but do not negate the need for immediate intervention.",

      "predicted": "You've shared some really difficult experiences and feelings with me. It's clear that you've been struggling with a significant loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and anxiety, and disruptions in your sleep. You've also mentioned increased irritability, physical discomfort, and feelings of detachment from yourself and others. It sounds like you're going through a very challenging time, and it's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to share these experiences. I'm here to help, and together we can work to improve your situation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> (<sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomachaches</sym>), <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (<sym>memory problems</sym>), <sym>relationship difficulties</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of these symptoms occurring nearly every day for more than two weeks indicates a severe impact on the patient's life. The patient's report of <quote>It's like nothing seems enjoyable anymore</quote> and <quote>I can't seem to get out of bed some days</quote> further supports this diagnosis. While <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is also a possibility given the patient's chronic worry and avoidance behaviors, the predominant symptoms align more closely with <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychological Evaluation:** Conduct a full psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of the depression and rule out other potential diagnoses or co-occurring conditions.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Refer the patient to a therapist for CBT, which can help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Therapy:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, refer to a sleep specialist.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure ongoing support and safety planning.\n6. **Social Connection:** Encourage gradual reengagement in social activities and relationships to combat feelings of <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.",
