        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure domains. They covered depression, irritability, anxiety, panic, avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, sleep problems, and memory. However, some domains like mania, psychotic symptoms, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use were either not directly addressed or received less attention. For instance, the therapist did not specifically inquire about 'mania' or 'repetitive thoughts and behaviors' in depth, but did cover related areas like irritability and anxiety. The coverage was generally thorough but with some minor omissions.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. They effectively explored areas such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation with clear and relevant questions. However, there were moments where the questions could have been more precise or comprehensive. For example, when discussing 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist could have probed further for specific details or frequency. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but occasionally lacked fine detail.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and panic attacks. However, there were a few instances where the conversation could have benefited from smoother transitions or more in-depth exploration of certain symptoms. For example, after discussing irritability, the therapist could have explored related areas like anger management. Overall, the conversation was coherent with minor areas for improvement.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Suicidal Ideation clearly aligned with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The justification was comprehensive, directly linking to DSM-5 criteria and thoroughly addressing the differential diagnosis. The presence of suicidal ideation was particularly emphasized as a critical factor requiring immediate attention.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy and a professional tone. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. However, there were moments where the interactions could have been more personalized or emotionally nuanced. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, a more empathetic and less clinical response could have been provided. Overall, the therapist was empathetic and professional, with minor areas for improvement in terms of warmth and personalization."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong clinical approach, effectively identifying and addressing key symptoms. The therapist covered most DSM-5 domains, showed empathy, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. Areas for improvement include more thorough exploration of all domains (e.g., mania, repetitive thoughts/behaviors), finer clinical precision in questioning, and enhanced emotional personalization. Overall, the therapist performed well, with a few minor issues that could be addressed in future sessions.",
