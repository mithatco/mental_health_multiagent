The patient's sleep disturbances, cognitive symptoms, and social withdrawal are clinically significant and warrant further evaluation. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of detachment during panic attacks indicate a need for targeted interventions to manage anxiety and prevent further deterioration in functioning. Regular monitoring for suicidal ideation and potential medical causes of symptoms is essential. Overall, a comprehensive treatment plan addressing both psychological and physical symptoms is recommended.",

There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, and the therapist appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures. The conversation had a smooth transition and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound.

The text describes panic attacks, feelings of impending doom, heart palpitations, and difficulty breathing, which are characteristic symptoms of panic. However, I wouldn't rate my confidence as a 5 because the diagnosis also mentions other conditions (MDD and GAD) that may be comorbid or overlapping, which could potentially complicate the primary diagnosis of panic.",

You've also mentioned increased irritability, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and withdrawal from social activities. It's clear that these experiences have been overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) (provisional impression)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of motivation</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, characterized by <sym>feelings of impending doom</sym>, <sym>heart palpitations</sym>, and <sym>difficulty breathing</sym>, along with <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, suggest <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's persistent and uncontrolled <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as <sym>stomachaches</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym> are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD). The patient's statements reflect a pattern of <quote>I've been feeling like that quite a bit</quote>, <quote>Almost every day</quote>, and <quote>Yes, I've been snapping at people and feeling angry more often</quote>, which supports the diagnoses. The provisional impression is based on the presented <sym>symptoms</sym>, and further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnoses. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> are clinically significant and warrant further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</med>.\n2. <med>Medication management</med> to consider <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> <symptoms</sym>.\n3. <med>Psychoeducation</med> to help the patient understand and manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Regular <med>follow-up appointments</med> to monitor <symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Referral to a <med>primary care physician</med> for a thorough <med>medical evaluation</med> to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med> and <med>stress management techniques</med> to improve overall well-being.\n7. Assess for <med>suicidal ideation</med> regularly, as the patient's feelings of hopelessness may increase the risk.",
