You've shared that you've been feeling a significant <sym>decrease in interest</sym> and <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, particularly since your divorce. You've also expressed persistent <sym>feelings of depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and a pervasive <sym>sense of sadness</sym>. You mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, which has led to conflicts with loved ones. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, with increased sleep duration and persistent <sym>fatigue</sym>. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future and <sym>worsening</sym> <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach discomfort</sym> are also concerning. It's clear that you've been <sym>withdrawing</sym> from social situations and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You've also mentioned that you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although you don't currently have the intent to act on them. It's important to acknowledge the complexity of your symptoms and the impact they've had on your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The <sym>decrease in interest</sym> and <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>persistent worrying</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> are also consistent with these diagnoses. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are concerning but do not necessarily warrant a diagnosis of <med>Suicidal Behavior Disorder</med> at this time, as the patient does not report current intent. The <sym>withdrawal</sym> from social situations and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis. Given the severity of symptoms and the lack of clear evidence for other diagnoses, a <med>provisional</med> diagnosis is warranted.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with information about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, including their symptoms, causes, and treatment options.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to help the patient address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>behavioral avoidance</sym> associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Encourage the patient to establish a regular sleep schedule and practice good <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n5. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider joining a support group for individuals experiencing <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Ideation:** Regularly assess the patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure they have a safety plan in place. If at any point the patient expresses a plan or intent to self-harm, immediate intervention is necessary.\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",

The patient reports significant anhedonia, depressive mood, increased irritability, and social withdrawal following a divorce, which may be contributing to their current symptoms. Physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach discomfort are also present, which may be psychosomatic in nature. The patient denies current suicidal intent but has had thoughts of self-harm, indicating a need for ongoing monitoring and support. The patient's avoidance behaviors and difficulty concentrating further highlight the need for a comprehensive treatment plan to address both depressive and anxious symptoms.",

The questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria with no inaccuracies or vague phrasing. The therapist used clinically accurate language and adapted questions to fit the patient's responses.",

You've shared that you've been feeling a significant <sym>decrease in interest</sym> and <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, particularly since your divorce. You've also expressed persistent <sym>feelings of depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and a pervasive <sym>sense of sadness</sym>. You mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, which has led to conflicts with loved ones. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, with increased sleep duration and persistent <sym>fatigue</sym>. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future and <sym>worsening</sym> <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach discomfort</sym> are also concerning. It's clear that you've been <sym>withdrawing</sym> from social situations and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You've also mentioned that you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although you don't currently have the intent to act on them. It's important to acknowledge the complexity of your symptoms and the impact they've had on your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The <sym>decrease in interest</sym> and <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>persistent worrying</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> are also consistent with these diagnoses. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are concerning but do not necessarily warrant a diagnosis of <med>Suicidal Behavior Disorder</med> at this time, as the patient does not report current intent. The <sym>withdrawal</sym> from social situations and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis. Given the severity of symptoms and the lack of clear evidence for other diagnoses, a <med>provisional</med> diagnosis is warranted.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with information about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, including their symptoms, causes, and treatment options.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to help the patient address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>behavioral avoidance</sym> associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Encourage the patient to establish a regular sleep schedule and practice good <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n5. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider joining a support group for individuals experiencing <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Ideation:** Regularly assess the patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure they have a safety plan in place. If at any point the patient expresses a plan or intent to self-harm, immediate intervention is necessary.\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
