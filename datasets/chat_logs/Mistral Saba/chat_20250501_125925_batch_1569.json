Co-occurring anxiety symptoms and interpersonal difficulties are also noted. The patient denies any psychotic features, substance abuse, or current suicidal ideation. The patient's symptoms may be exacerbated by concerns about future changes and a sense of uncertainty about their identity and life purpose.

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, experiencing a significant decrease in your interest and enjoyment in activities you used to love. You've mentioned feeling persistently down and hopeless, with increased irritability and difficulty sleeping. It's understandable that these feelings can also lead to <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worries</sym> about the future, as well as feelings of disconnect and uncertainty about your identity. You've also mentioned some physical <sym>symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, and it's possible these could be related to the emotional stress you're experiencing. It's commendable that you're reaching out, as this is an important step towards managing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, which are core <symptoms</sym> of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> (headaches, stomachaches). These symptoms have been present for an extended period, causing significant impairment in daily functioning. Although the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, the presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> warrants close monitoring. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> and <sym>substance abuse</sym> further supports the diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>.\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient challenge and modify negative thought patterns and behaviors, and to develop coping strategies.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. Monitor for side effects and therapeutic response.\n3. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> to reduce stigma, enhance understanding, and encourage self-management strategies.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> through <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</med> to improve relationships and social functioning.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> severity, treatment response, and any potential <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. Collaborate with the patient to adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n7. **Referral to Specialist:** If <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> persist or worsen, consider referring the patient to a primary care physician or a specialist for further evaluation.\n8. **Substance Use Screening:** Regularly screen for <sym>substance use</sym> to ensure the patient is not self-medicating or engaging in harmful behaviors.",
