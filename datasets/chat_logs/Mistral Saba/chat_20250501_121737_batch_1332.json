      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences over the past two weeks. It sounds like you've been struggling with a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. You've mentioned feeling down and hopeless, with periods of irritability and anger. It's clear that you've been experiencing a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym>, feeling on edge and sometimes even panicked. You've also noted <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling and staying asleep, as well as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym> that seem to be causing you distress. It's also concerning that you feel detached from others and unsure about your identity and life direction. I'm here to help, and I want to work with you to address these challenges.\n\n**<med>Diagnosis:</med> Major Depressive Disorder with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive</med> features\n\n**<med>Reasoning:</med>** The patient presents with a clear <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The patient's report of increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic symptoms</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (OCD) features. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of detachment also point to potential <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Personality Disorder</med> traits. However, the core symptoms align most closely with MDD and OCD features, making this the primary diagnostic impression.\n\n**<med>Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:</med>**\n1. <med>Referral for a Comprehensive Psychological Evaluation</med>: This will help to further assess and clarify the diagnosis, including potential <med>co-occurring disorders</med>.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) for <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>: CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, as well as challenge and modify <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>.\n3. <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (ERP) Therapy: This is a specific type of CBT effective for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, helping to manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n4. <med>Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques</med>: These can help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT): This can address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and existential concerns, helping the patient feel more connected and fulfilled.\n6. Regular Follow-up: Monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed to ensure the best possible outcome.",
