Although both conditions can present with psychotic features, the primary symptoms described in the diagnosis are consistent with MDD, including depressed mood, anhedonia, and sleep disturbances. The presence of auditory hallucinations and delusional thoughts suggests a psychotic component, but it is framed within the context of MDD rather than schizophrenia.",
