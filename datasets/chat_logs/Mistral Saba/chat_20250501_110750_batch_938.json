Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and others, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and language was precise and aligned with DSM-5 terminology.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, and each question naturally follows from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, and the therapist followed up on concerning disclosures. The questions logically built on previous responses, creating a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis clearly aligns with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cite specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis explicitly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a difficult time lately. You've described feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> quite frequently, and you've mentioned that you don't find joy in things you used to. You've also mentioned <sym>sleeping more but still feeling tired</sym>, feeling <sym>irritated</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, especially around others, and you have frequent <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym>. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others, and having <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about what others think of you. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your life and relationships. I appreciate your openness and honesty in sharing these feelings. It's important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and I'm here to support you in this process.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent, Moderate)\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>depressed mood</sym> episodes that have persisted over the past two weeks. They report feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>major depressive disorder</med> (MDD). The patient also exhibits <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are common in MDD. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, which can accompany <med>MDD</med>. The patient's history of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, though not actively planned, is also concerning. The <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym> may indicate a more complex interplay between mood and <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, but the core symptoms are most consistent with <med>MDD</med>.\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) to address the <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. CBT can help manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <med>dissociative symptoms</med> as well. IPT can help improve <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n2. **Medication:** Referral to a psychiatrist for possible <med>antidepressant</med> medication. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>MDD</med>.\n3. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to improve overall <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>energy levels</sym>.\n4. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the history of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, ensure there is a safety plan in place and regular check-ins to monitor risk.\n6. **Psychosocial Support:** Encourage the patient to stay connected with supportive friends and family, and consider support groups for <med>MDD</med>.",
