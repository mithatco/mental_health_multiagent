This assessment will help us identify areas of concern and plan your care. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your feelings and thoughts. This questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask each one in turn. Let's start with the first question: How much has little interest or pleasure in doing things bothered you in the past two weeks?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\n1. **Main Symptoms and Concerns**:\n   - **Depressive Symptoms**: The patient reports persistent anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), depressed mood (\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"), and loss of energy (\"doesn't have the energy for new projects\").\n   - **Anxiety Symptoms**: The patient experiences excessive worry (\"feels anxious a lot\"), nervousness, and panic attacks (\"sudden rush of panic\").\n   - **Sleep Disturbances**: The patient reports insomnia (\"wakes up at 4 or 5 in the morning and can't fall back asleep\") and excessive sleepiness (\"sleeps a lot, but still feels tired\").\n   - **Somatic Symptoms**: The patient experiences unexplained aches and pains (\"unexplained pains, back hurts, stomach feels uncomfortable\").\n   - **Cognitive Symptoms**: The patient reports memory problems (\"forget things more often, harder to focus\") and feeling detached (\"feels detached, like not really here\").\n   - **Existential Concerns**: The patient expresses feelings of emptiness and lack of purpose (\"doesn't know who they really are or what they want out of life\").\n   - **Social Withdrawal**: The patient avoids social situations due to anxiety (\"avoids situations that make her anxious, stays home most of the time\").\n   - **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient reports having fleeting thoughts of self-harm (\"sometimes I think about it, but I wouldn't actually do it\").\n\n2. **Patterns in Responses**:\n   - The patient's responses consistently indicate a pattern of depression and anxiety. There is a clear theme of avoidance and withdrawal, particularly in social situations.\n   - The patient's sleep disturbances are notable, with both excessive sleepiness and insomnia being reported.\n   - The patient's cognitive symptoms and somatic complaints suggest a possible functional overlay or somatic symptoms related to the psychological distress.\n\n3. **Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**:\n   - **Major Depressive Disorder**: The patient's anhedonia, depressed mood, loss of energy, and suicidal ideation suggest a possible diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.\n   - **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's excessive worry, nervousness, and panic attacks suggest a possible diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n   - **Insomnia Disorder**: The patient's sleep disturbances warrant further evaluation for Insomnia Disorder.\n   - **Somatic Symptom Disorder**: The patient's unexplained aches and pains, along with feelings of not being taken seriously, suggest a possible diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder.\n   - **Dissociative Symptoms**: The patient's feelings of detachment warrant further evaluation for Dissociative Disorders.\n\n4. **Risk Factors or Warning Signs**:\n   - **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient reports having fleeting thoughts of self-harm, which is a significant risk factor for suicide.\n   - **Social Withdrawal**: The patient's avoidance of social situations and feelings of detachment from others may increase the risk of social isolation and exacerbate symptoms.\n   - **Somatic Symptoms**: The patient's unexplained aches and pains may indicate a higher level of distress or a comorbid medical condition.\n\n5. **Summary in Clinical Language**:\n   The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, including anhedonia, depressed mood, loss of energy, and suicidal ideation. There are also indicators of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, such as excessive worry and panic attacks. The patient's sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and dissociative feelings suggest possible comorbid conditions, including Insomnia Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder, and Dissociative Disorders. The patient's social withdrawal and fleeting thoughts of self-harm warrant close monitoring and a comprehensive safety assessment. Further evaluation is recommended to determine the underlying etiology of the patient's symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've shared that you've been feeling persistently <sym>down</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, with little interest in things you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, along with some unexplained <sym>aches and pains</sym>. It's understandable that these <sym>symptoms</sym> can feel overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're seeking help. It's also important to note that you've been feeling <sym>detached</sym> and uncertain about your identity and purpose, which can be very distressing. Your experiences with <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlight the severity of your situation. Overall, you've been feeling quite isolated and unsure of how to move forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Insomnia Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The <sym>symptoms</sym> you've described, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>loss of energy</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>symptoms</sym> of <sym>insomnia</sym> are also noted. These <sym>symptoms</sym> are not clearly warranted for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> given the predominant psychological distress. The <sym>symptoms</sym> of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>existential concerns</sym> are also present but not at a level to warrant a separate diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a <med>Mental Health Professional</med>:** Given the severity of your <sym>symptoms</med>, it is crucial to consult with a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation and to develop a tailored treatment plan.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT can help you manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> by identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible pharmacological treatment to manage <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Work with a healthcare provider to establish good sleep habits and address <sym>insomnia</sym>. This may include relaxation techniques, sleep schedules, and environmental modifications.\n5. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage engagement with a support system, whether it's friends, family, or support groups, to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and provide emotional support.\n7. **Safety Plan:** Develop a safety plan with your mental health provider to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. This plan should include coping strategies, support contacts, and steps to take if <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> become overwhelming.",
