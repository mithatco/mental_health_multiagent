      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a rough patch lately. You've described feeling a significant loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, along with persistent sadness and hopelessness. Sleep disturbances, particularly early morning waking and poor sleep quality, have been affecting your daily life. You've also mentioned feeling more anxious and avoiding situations that used to bring you joy. Additionally, you've been experiencing physical symptoms like <sym>tension in your back</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym>, as well as <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. It's understandable that these symptoms have led you to feel detached and uncertain about your identity and life goals, and it's especially concerning that you've had thoughts that others would be better off without you, even if you haven't acted on them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent pattern of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms over the past two weeks. Key indicators include <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>I used to enjoy my hobbies, but now they just don't seem to matter</quote>), <sym>persistent sad mood</sym> (<quote>I've been feeling really sad, almost every day</quote>), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I wake up very early in the morning and can't go back to sleep</quote>), <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym> (<quote>I feel like my memory is worse than it used to be</quote>), and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (<quote>Sometimes I think that others would be better off without me</quote>). These symptoms are not attributed to another medical condition or the physiological effects of a substance. The patient also exhibits <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors (<quote>I've been staying home more often, avoiding places that used to make me happy</quote>) and <sym>general anxiety</sym> (<quote>I've been feeling anxious a lot. Like I'm constantly worried about something</quote>). The severity and duration of these symptoms warrant a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a mental health professional to discuss these findings and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, focusing on <sym>cognitive restructuring</sym> and <sym>behavioral activation</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>medication management</med> options with a psychiatrist, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (SNRIs) to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> techniques to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>regular physical activity</med> and maintain a <med>healthy diet</med> to support overall well-being.\n6. Connect the patient with support groups or peer support services to reduce feelings of <sym>social isolation</sym> and promote a sense of community.\n7. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely and ensure the patient's safety, providing resources for immediate support if needed, such as the <med>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</med>.",
