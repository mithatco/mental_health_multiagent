The patient's sleep disturbance, emotional detachment, and avoidance behaviors may be indicative of an underlying adjustment disorder. No psychotic symptoms, substance use, or suicidal ideation were reported. The patient's feelings of hopelessness and emotional detachment warrant ongoing monitoring for potential risk of self-harm. Further evaluation is recommended to determine the primary diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.",

The <sym>avoidance</sym> of social situations and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from oneself and the environment may indicate <med>dissociative features</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> further support a diagnosis of <med>anxiety</med>. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been present for more than two weeks, causing significant impairment in your daily functioning, which is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for these conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider engaging in <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depressive</sym> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms. These therapies can help you develop coping strategies and improve your emotional well-being.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> by practicing good <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Social Support:** Gradually re-engage in social activities and consider joining support groups to combat <sym>avoidance</sym> and <sym>emotional detachment</sym>. Building a support network can help you feel more connected and less isolated.\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor your <sym>symptoms</sym> and schedule follow-up appointments to assess your progress. If <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> emerges, seek immediate help from a mental health professional or emergency services.\n6. **Education:** Learn about <med>mental health</med> and <med>self-care</med> strategies to better understand and manage your condition. Knowledge can empower you to take an active role in your treatment.",
