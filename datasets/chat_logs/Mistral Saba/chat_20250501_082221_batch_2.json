        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other relevant areas, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist phrased questions in clinically accurate ways that align with DSM-5 terminology and did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning. The language used was precise and aligned with clinical criteria, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 framework.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured that questions logically built on previous responses, creating a smooth and coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cite specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis explicitly linked to DSM-5 criteria. Alternative diagnoses were considered, and the differential diagnosis was comprehensively addressed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation. The therapist's approach was supportive and non-judgmental, creating a safe space for the patient to share their experiences."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional performance across all criteria. The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, asked clinically relevant and accurate questions, maintained a logical flow, provided clear diagnostic justification, and interacted with consistent empathy and professionalism.

        "explanation": "The diagnosis mentions 'Obsessive-Compulsive Personality traits' but does not explicitly diagnose OCD. The symptoms described, such as intrusive thoughts and rituals, could be related to OCD, but the primary diagnosis given is Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety. The mention of 'Obsessive-Compulsive Personality traits' seems to conflate OCD with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), which are distinct conditions.",
