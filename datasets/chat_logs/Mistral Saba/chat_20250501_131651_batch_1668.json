      "predicted": "You've shared a lot of personal and challenging experiences with me today. I appreciate your bravery in discussing these difficult feelings and <sym>symptoms</sym>. It's clear that you've been struggling with a range of <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as some <sym>somatic</sym> complaints and <sym>obsessive-compulsive</sym> behaviors. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> you've mentioned is particularly concerning, and it's important that we address that right away.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** Your report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates a comorbid <med>Anxiety</med> disorder. Additionally, the <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>, such as excessive handwashing and checking, align with <med>OCD</med> features. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym> experiences may be related to the underlying <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, or they could indicate a comorbid <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>. Further evaluation is needed to determine the primary diagnoses and rule out other possibilities.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Risk Assessment</med>: Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough <med>risk assessment</med> to determine the immediate need for safety planning and intervention.\n\n2. <med>Psychotherapy</med>: Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> components. <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> can be integrated to target the <med>OCD</med> features.\n\n3. <med>Medication Management</med>: Consider a referral to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> are often used for <med>OCD</med> as well.\n\n4. <med>Safety Planning</med>: Develop a <med>safety plan</med> with you to address the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. This should include strategies for coping with <sym>crisis</sym> situations and resources for support.\n\n5. <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med>: Incorporate <med>IPT</med> to address the <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> you've been experiencing.\n\n6. <med>Psychoeducation</med>: Provide <med>psychoeducation</med> about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help you understand your experiences and the treatment process.\n\n7. <med>Follow-up Appointments</med>: Schedule regular <med>follow-up appointments</med> to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
