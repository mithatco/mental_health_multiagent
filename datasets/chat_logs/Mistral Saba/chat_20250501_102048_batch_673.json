      "predicted": "Based on your responses, it's clear that you've been experiencing a range of difficult emotions and physical symptoms over the past two weeks. You've expressed feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You've also mentioned increased irritability, persistent anxiety, and a sense of detachment from yourself and others. Additionally, you've been dealing with sleep disturbances, unexplained physical pain, and some cognitive difficulties. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're taking the step to seek help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) is warranted due to the presence of multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> including persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> also align with the diagnosis of MDD. The <quote>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> and <quote>feeling that you don't know who you really are or what you want out of life</quote> strongly suggest a depressive episode. The <sym>anxiety</sym> is pervasive and interferes with daily functioning, which is consistent with <med>Anxious Distress</med> specifier. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> further support the diagnosis, as these can accompany <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> <sym>symptoms</sym>. CBT can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n2. **Medication**: Discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> medication with a psychiatrist. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>MDD</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> by establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Lifestyle Changes**: Incorporate regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness or meditation to improve overall well-being.\n5. **Substance Use Evaluation**: Given the occasional use of alcohol and painkillers, it is important to assess and monitor <med>substance use</med> to prevent misuse.\n6. **Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
