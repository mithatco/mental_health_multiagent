I appreciate you sharing these feelings and experiences with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits, and potential <med>Cognitive Impairment</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <quote>I've been feeling kind of disinterested...I just can't find the motivation to do them anymore</quote> and <quote>I've felt pretty down lately...It's been hard to see the positive side of things</quote>, which aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym> symptoms, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> suggest a component of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> could suggest a <med>Cognitive Impairment</med> or a dissociative component.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym>.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider initiating <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. A <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI)</med> could be a good starting point, given the presence of <med>OCD</med> traits.\n3. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</med>, and <med>OCD</med> traits. This can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Supportive Therapy:** Offer supportive therapy to help the patient explore <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>identity disturbance</sym>, and to improve <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and assess for any <med>side effects</med> from medication.\n7. **Referral to Specialists:** If <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> persists, consider referring the patient to a <med>neurologist</med> or <med>neuropsychologist</med> for further evaluation.",
