You've expressed feeling <sym>down and hopeless</sym>, with <sym>little interest or pleasure</sym> in things you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, as well as <sym>feeling detached from others</sym> and yourself. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming and isolating. You've also mentioned having <sym>occasional thoughts of self-harm</sym>, even if you haven't made any specific plans. It's important to acknowledge the bravery it took for you to share these feelings with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (Provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reported <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are all consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> may also be associated with this disorder. Given the patient's <quote>I wake up at 4 or 5 AM and can't go back to sleep</quote>, this could indicate <med>insomnia</med> which is a common <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Provide <quote>the patient</quote> with information about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce self-stigma.\n\n2. **Therapy:** Refer <quote>the patient</quote> to <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive symptoms and improve coping skills.\n\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consult with a psychiatrist to consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> if therapy alone is insufficient.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n5. **Safety Planning:** Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure <quote>the patient</quote>'s immediate safety.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
