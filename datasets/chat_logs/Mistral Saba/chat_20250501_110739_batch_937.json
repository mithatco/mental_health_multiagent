Your responses will be kept confidential, and this will help us create a safe and supportive space for you. We'll be going through 23 questions. Let's start whenever you're ready."

Additionally, there are significant affective symptoms, including depression and anxiety, which contribute to the overall clinical picture. The patient's sleep disturbances and interpersonal difficulties further complicate the clinical presentation. Medication non-adherence is a notable concern that requires intervention to ensure optimal symptom management. The patient\u2019s suicidal ideation, though not immediate, necessitates ongoing monitoring and safety planning. The overall severity of the symptoms suggests a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and intervention.",
