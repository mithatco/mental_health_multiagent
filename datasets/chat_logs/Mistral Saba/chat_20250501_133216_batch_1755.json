You've mentioned experiencing a profound loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and increased irritability. It's clear that these <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life and relationships. Additionally, you've described <sym>anxiety</sym> that keeps you on edge, with intrusive worries and panic attacks. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> you're experiencing, including excessive sleep and difficulty falling back asleep, likely contribute to your overall distress. It's also concerning to hear about your feelings of detachment and the struggle to connect with others, as well as the uncertainty about your personal identity and life goals. It's important to address these issues to improve your quality of life and regain a sense of purpose and connection.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med> and <med>dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> for over two weeks indicates a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>increased irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests <med>anxious distress</med>. Additionally, the <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from oneself and surroundings point to <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can accompany <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>withdrawal from social interactions</sym>, and <sym>feelings of being overwhelmed</sym> further support this diagnosis. There is no evidence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>, <med>substance use disorder</med>, or other specific <med>anxiety disorders</med> that would warrant a different diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. This can help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal skills.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to manage <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family. Social support is crucial for mental health recovery. Consider involving a therapist or support group to facilitate this process.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",

      "predicted": "It appears you've been struggling with significant <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and feelings of disconnection. You've mentioned experiencing a profound loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and increased irritability. It's clear that these <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life and relationships. Additionally, you've described <sym>anxiety</sym> that keeps you on edge, with intrusive worries and panic attacks. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> you're experiencing, including excessive sleep and difficulty falling back asleep, likely contribute to your overall distress. It's also concerning to hear about your feelings of detachment and the struggle to connect with others, as well as the uncertainty about your personal identity and life goals. It's important to address these issues to improve your quality of life and regain a sense of purpose and connection.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med> and <med>dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> for over two weeks indicates a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>increased irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests <med>anxious distress</med>. Additionally, the <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from oneself and surroundings point to <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can accompany <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>withdrawal from social interactions</sym>, and <sym>feelings of being overwhelmed</sym> further support this diagnosis. There is no evidence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>, <med>substance use disorder</med>, or other specific <med>anxiety disorders</med> that would warrant a different diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. This can help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal skills.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to manage <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family. Social support is crucial for mental health recovery. Consider involving a therapist or support group to facilitate this process.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
