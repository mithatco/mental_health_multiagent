      "predicted": "Based on your responses, it's clear that you've been experiencing a significant amount of distress over the past two weeks. You've described feeling persistently down, depressed, and hopeless, with a noticeable lack of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed. You've also mentioned feeling anxious and on edge, with <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, particularly <sym>early morning awakenings</sym>. Additionally, you've expressed <sym>cognitive</sym> difficulties and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming and isolating. It's important to recognize that these experiences are valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> over the past two weeks, which fulfill the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> according to the DSM-5. The <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms reported are not severe and appear secondary to the depressive symptoms. The patient's <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> are consistent with the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of depression. There is no evidence of <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med> or <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> to suggest a different diagnosis. The patient's occasional thoughts of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without specific plans warrant further evaluation but do not change the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Referral to a mental health professional</med> for a comprehensive evaluation, including a more detailed assessment of <med>suicidal risk</med>.\n2. <med>Pharmacological treatment options</med> such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>) to manage <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n3. <med>Psychotherapy options</med> such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>cognitive distortions</sym>, <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</med>.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene education</med> and possible <med>sleep medication</med> to manage <sym>insomnia</sym>.\n5. <med>Regular follow-ups</med> to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. <med>Psychoeducation</med> for the patient and their support system about <med>depression</med>, its symptoms, and available treatments.\n7. <med>Screening for co-occurring conditions</med> such as <med>anxiety disorders</med> or <med>other medical issues</med> that may contribute to or exacerbate <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n8. <med>Exploration of lifestyle changes</med> such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management techniques to support overall well-being.",
