      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through an incredibly challenging time recently. You've mentioned feeling persistently down and hopeless, with a noticeable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. It's clear that you've been experiencing significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which have led you to avoid certain situations and people. Additionally, your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and feelings of detachment and disconnection from yourself and others add layers of complexity to your current state. It's understandable that you might be feeling lost and uncertain about your identity and future. Your occasional heavy drinking to cope with sleep issues is also concerning. It's commendable that you've reached out for help, and I want to assure you that we're here to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and potential <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Consideration of <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (PTSD) based on accident history and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> due to occasional heavy drinking.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>I don't know, it's just felt harder to find joy in things I used to like</quote>), along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> (<quote>It's like a dark cloud hanging over me</quote>). These symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient also experiences frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> (<quote>I'm always on edge</quote>, <quote>Yeah, there are times when I feel like I'm having a panic attack</quote>), suggesting <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's avoidance of driving and certain situations related to a past accident, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (<quote>Yeah, sometimes I see the accident in my mind, like it's happening again</quote>), indicates potential <med>PTSD</med>. The patient's occasional heavy drinking to cope with sleep issues suggests a potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>PTSD</sym> symptoms. CBT can help manage <sym>negative thoughts</sym> and <sym>behaviors</sym>, and develop coping strategies for <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medication evaluation to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SNRIs) may be useful. For <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, a <med>sedative-hypnotic</med> or <med>melatonin receptor agonist</med> could be considered.\n3. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's <med>substance use disorder</med> risk and provide education about the potential consequences of <med>alcohol use disorder</med>. If necessary, refer to a <med>substance abuse</med> specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>PTSD</med> and <med>panic disorder</med> to help the patient understand their symptoms and develop a sense of agency in their treatment.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a network of support. This can help combat <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.",
