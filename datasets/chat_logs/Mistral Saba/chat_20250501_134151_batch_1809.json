You've shared that you've been feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> and lacking interest in activities you used to enjoy. It sounds like you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> frequently, and your sleep has been disrupted, with periods of both <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>hypersomnia</sym>. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, and you're struggling with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>identity</sym> issues. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're seeking help. It's also important to note that you've been engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and have had <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, even if they haven't been acted upon.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with symptoms of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and feeling of being on edge suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> could indicate a <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> manic or hypomanic phase. The feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> are indicative of <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> further supports a complex mental health presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. This will help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n2. **Medication Review:** Consult with a psychiatrist to review current medications and consider <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Monitor for any signs of <med>bipolar disorder</med> and adjust medications accordingly.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include a consistent sleep schedule, relaxation techniques before bed, and avoiding <sym>screen time</sym> close to bedtime.\n\n4. **Risk Management:** Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to manage <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. This should include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and <med>dissociative symptoms</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n\n6. **Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n\n7. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to combat feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.\n\n8. **Assessment for Trauma:** Given the dissociative symptoms, assess for any history of <med>trauma</med> and consider <med>Trauma-Focused Therapy</med> if indicated.",
