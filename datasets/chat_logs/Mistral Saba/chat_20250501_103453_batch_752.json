This assessment helps us understand your current mental health and identify areas that may need further attention. Everything you share with me is confidential, and our goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you to express your experiences. We will be going through 23 questions, and I'll ask each one at a time. Let's start with the first question. Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things recently? (Please describe your experience in your own words.)"

It's like I'm just going through the motions at work too. It's just been hard to find any real joy in the things I used to love."

      "predicted": "I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences with me. It sounds like you've been going through a lot lately, and it's clear that the aftermath of the accident has been taking a significant toll on your mental health. You've been struggling with feelings of sadness, anxiety, and a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. It's understandable that you're feeling disconnected and isolated, especially with the avoidance behaviors you've been experiencing. It's also concerning to hear about the <sym>panic attacks</sym> and the increased alcohol use. You're not alone in these feelings, and it's important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength. Our goal is to support you and find effective ways to manage these challenges together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>PTSD</med> as they report <sym>intrusive memories</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to the accident, as well as <sym>negative alterations in cognitions and mood</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</med>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</med> suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The increased alcohol use to cope with sleep issues and emotional distress further supports a diagnosis of <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychological assessment to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Initiate <med>trauma-focused therapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure (PE)</med>, to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for the treatment of <med>PTSD</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n4. Implement <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n5. Address <med>substance use disorder</med> through <med>substance use counseling</med> and, if necessary, <med>pharmacological interventions</med>.\n6. Provide education and support for the patient's family and friends to help them understand and cope with the patient's experiences.\n7. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely and provide appropriate interventions if necessary. Ensure the patient has a safety plan in place.\n8. Regularly review and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress and feedback.",
