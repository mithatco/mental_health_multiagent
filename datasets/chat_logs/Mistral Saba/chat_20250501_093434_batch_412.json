Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n- **Major Depressive Disorder**: Symptoms of depression, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Persistent anxiety, nervousness, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Psychotic Symptoms**: Auditory hallucinations and thought insertion/broadcasting may indicate psychotic features.\n- **Substance Use**: Past substance use, although currently not frequent, may be relevant to the patient's overall mental health status.\n- **Non-adherence to Medication**: The patient has stopped taking prescribed medication, which may exacerbate symptoms.\n\n#### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient has thoughts of self-harm and has stopped taking prescribed medications.\n- **Psychotic Symptoms**: Auditory hallucinations and thought insertion/broadcasting are significant risk factors.\n- **Social Isolation**: Avoidance of social situations and feelings of detachment from others could lead to further isolation and worsening symptoms.\n\n#### 5. Summary in Clinical Language\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, including anhedonia, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances. Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms of generalized anxiety, with episodes of panic and avoidance behaviors. Psychotic features, such as auditory hallucinations and thought insertion/broadcasting, are present and warrant immediate attention. The patient's history of substance use and non-adherence to medication further complicates the clinical picture. The patient's social withdrawal and cognitive impairment contribute to a complex and potentially deteriorating mental health condition. Immediate intervention is warranted to address both the depressive and psychotic symptoms, as well as the patient's suicidal ideation.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through an incredibly challenging time, with feelings of sadness, anxiety, and even <sym>psychotic</sym> experiences that have been causing you a lot of distress. You've mentioned that <quote>nothing really seems fun anymore</quote> and that you feel <quote>down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> all the time. It's understandable that this has been overwhelming, and I want you to know that it's important to address these feelings. You've also mentioned some concerning thoughts of self-harm, which we should definitely explore further to ensure your safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are all consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought insertion/broadcasting</sym> suggests <med>psychotic features</med>. These psychotic symptoms, combined with the depressive symptoms, warrant a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>. The patient's history of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>non-adherence to medication</sym> further complicates the clinical picture but does not overshadow the primary depressive and psychotic symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to assess the patient's immediate safety risks and develop a safety plan. This may include a referral to an emergency department or inpatient psychiatric unit if necessary.\n\n2. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>. This should include a detailed history, mental status examination, and consideration of <med>laboratory tests</med> to rule out medical causes of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>psychosis</sym>.\n\n3. **Medication Management:** Given the diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>, a combination of <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>antipsychotics</med> may be necessary. The patient should be encouraged to adhere to a prescribed medication regimen and monitored closely for side effects and efficacy.\n\n4. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> and other evidence-based psychotherapies can be beneficial in managing <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. Therapy should also focus on safety planning, coping skills, and addressing any <sym>psychotic</sym> experiences.\n\n5. **Support Services:** Connecting the patient with support groups, peer support services, and family support can provide additional resources and reduce feelings of isolation. <med>Case management</med> services can also help coordinate care and ensure adherence to treatment.\n\n6. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Given the patient's history of <sym>substance use</sym>, an evaluation for <med>substance use disorder</med> and appropriate treatment should be considered. This may include <med>substance abuse counseling</med> and <med>medication-assisted treatment</med> if needed.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Regular follow-ups with a mental health professional are essential to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. This can include both psychiatric and therapeutic appointments.",
