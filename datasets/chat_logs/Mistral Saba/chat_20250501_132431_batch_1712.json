Refer the patient to a mental health professional for ongoing <med>therapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n3. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely and ensure the patient's safety. If necessary, implement a safety plan and consider <med>hospitalization</med> or <med>intensive outpatient treatment</med>.\n4. Refer the patient to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and explore potential treatments, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia</med> (<med>CBT-I</med>).\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a healthy <med>diet</med> to support overall well-being.\n6. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, in consultation with the patient's primary care physician or a psychiatrist.\n7. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>, and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan.\n8.

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been feeling quite <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> lately, with a sense of hopelessness and lack of pleasure in the things you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be quite overwhelming. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>uneasiness</sym> in your body, which can be concerning. It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain about who you are and what you want in life. It's commendable that you're seeking help to understand and manage these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). Additionally, the patient experiences excessive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, which are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>). The patient's <sym>somatoform symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings could be associated with these primary disorders. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even if not strongly endorsed, is a significant concern that warrants thorough assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity and duration of <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, and to rule out any <med>medical conditions</med> that might be contributing to these symptoms.\n2. Refer the patient to a mental health professional for ongoing <med>therapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n3. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> closely and ensure the patient's safety. If necessary, implement a safety plan and consider <med>hospitalization</med> or <med>intensive outpatient treatment</med>.\n4. Refer the patient to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and explore potential treatments, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia</med> (<med>CBT-I</med>).\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a healthy <med>diet</med> to support overall well-being.\n6. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, in consultation with the patient's primary care physician or a psychiatrist.\n7. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>, and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan.\n8. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
