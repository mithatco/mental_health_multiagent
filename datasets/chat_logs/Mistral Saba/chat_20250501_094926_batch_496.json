The patient's sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and dissociative experiences further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's avoidance behaviors and social disconnection suggest additional areas of focus in treatment. Close monitoring for suicidal ideation is essential given the presence of depressive symptoms. The patient's denial of substance abuse and adherence to prescribed medications are positive indicators. A thorough assessment and treatment plan should address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a focus on coping strategies and social reintegration.",

It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and it's important to acknowledge the impact they've had on your life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive</med> traits\n\n**Reasoning:** Your report of persistently <sym>feeling down</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and losing interest in activities you used to enjoy (<sym>anhedonia</sym>) is indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the excessive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors you described (<sym>avoiding crowded places</sym> and <sym> highways</sym>) suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Your <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (e.g., <sym>repeatedly checking locks</sym>) point to <med>Obsessive-Compulsive</med> traits. The presence of multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> across these <med>diagnoses</med> indicates a complex <med>clinical picture</med>, which requires a <med>comprehensive assessment</med> and <med>treatment plan</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. This may include <med>Exposure Therapy</med> to help reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</med> associated with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> options, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, which can help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Practice <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med>, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage reconnection with supportive relationships and social activities. Consider joining support groups or engaging in group therapy to address <sym>social disconnection</sym>.\n6. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust the <med>treatment plan</med> as needed.",
