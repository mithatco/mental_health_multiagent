        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, etc., and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'sleep less than usual but still have a lot of energy,' the therapist could have been more precise in defining 'a lot of energy.' However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted DSM-5 symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's thoughts of self-harm and substance use. The conversation had a coherent and logical progression, with no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, providing a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration. The diagnostic conclusions are well-supported by the patient's reported symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing the patient's fleeting thoughts of self-harm, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a thorough and systematic approach to assessing the patient's symptoms using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. The therapist effectively explored all relevant domains, and the diagnostic conclusions are well-supported by the patient's reported symptoms. While there are minor areas for improvement, such as more precise phrasing of questions and enhanced emotional validation, the conversation overall is strong and provides a solid foundation for treatment planning.",
