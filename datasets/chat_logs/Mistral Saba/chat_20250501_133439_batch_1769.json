Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - **Mood Variability:** The patient reports significant mood swings, ranging from depressive episodes characterized by loss of interest, hopelessness, and irritability, to manic episodes with increased energy, decreased sleep, and impulsive behavior.\n   - **Anxiety:** Persistent anxiety and worry, particularly during depressive episodes, with avoidance behaviors and constant fear.\n   - **Sleep Disturbances:** Extreme variability in sleep patterns, including both oversleeping during depression and insomnia during manic episodes.\n   - **Cognitive Impairment:** Difficulty with concentration and memory, especially during depressive episodes.\n   - **Identity and Relationship Issues:** Feelings of detachment, identity crisis, and difficulty maintaining close relationships.\n   - **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained headaches and stomachaches, which may be somatization of psychological distress.\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n   - **Bipolar Affective Disorder:** The patient's description of mood swings, with periods of depression and mania, is consistent with Bipolar Affective Disorder.\n   - **Co-occurring Anxiety:** Anxiety seems to be a prominent feature, especially during depressive episodes.\n   - **Identity and Relationship Struggles:** The patient's sense of disconnection and identity crisis is a recurring theme, impacting both personal identity and interpersonal relationships.\n   - **Sleep Patterns:** The patient's sleep patterns are directly influenced by their mood state, with depression leading to oversleeping and mania leading to insomnia.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Risk of Suicidality:** Although the patient denies active suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideation with thoughts of death suggests a potential risk.\n   - **Substance Use:** Although the patient reports minimal alcohol and no tobacco use, misuse of painkillers indicates a need for monitoring and potential substance use disorder.\n   - **Comorbid Conditions:** The presence of anxiety and potential somatization warrants exploration.\n   - **Social Functioning:** The impact of mood swings on relationships and social functioning is significant and requires therapeutic intervention.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n   - **Impulsive Behavior:** The patient's history of risky behaviors during manic episodes, such as financial and business ventures, poses significant risk.\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Although not currently active, the patient's thoughts about death and not being here anymore are concerning.\n   - **Substance Misuse:** The use of painkillers beyond prescription indicates a potential pattern of substance misuse.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\n   The patient presents with symptoms consistent with Bipolar Affective Disorder, characterized by significant mood swings between depressive and manic episodes. The depressive episodes are marked by anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Manic episodes are characterized by decreased sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and grandiose behaviors. The patient also reports persistent anxiety and avoidance behaviors, as well as a sense of disconnection and identity crisis. Sleep disturbances are prominent and directly tied to mood state. There is evidence of somatic symptoms, potential substance misuse, and an underlying risk of suicidality. The patient's social functioning is impaired, with difficulties in maintaining close relationships and managing impulsive behaviors. Further evaluation and treatment planning should focus on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and addressing any comorbid conditions.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been experiencing significant fluctuations in your mood, with periods of intense depression and mania. You've described feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> and having <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> during depressive episodes. These times are also marked by <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>. Conversely, during manic episodes, you experience a surge of energy, leading to <sym>impaired sleep</sym> and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>, such as starting new projects and engaging in risky activities. These <sym>mood swings</sym> have taken a toll on your <sym>sleep patterns</sym>, <sym>relationships</sym>, and overall <sym>sense of self</sym>. You've also mentioned <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> that you can't explain, which might be a manifestation of your psychological distress. It's important to note that while you haven't had active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, you've had thoughts about death, and you've used painkillers beyond prescription. These experiences must be addressed to ensure your safety and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar Affective Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's description of <sym>mood swings</sym> between depressive and manic episodes is characteristic of <med>Bipolar Affective Disorder</med>. During depressive episodes, the patient experiences <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>. Manic episodes are marked by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are directly tied to their <sym>mood state</sym>, with <sym>oversleeping</sym> during depression and <sym>insomnia</sym> during mania. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> is a prominent feature, particularly during depressive episodes, and there is evidence of <sym>substance misuse</sym> with painkillers. The <sym>identity crisis</sym> and <sym>relationship struggles</sym> further support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Affective Disorder</med>, as these issues are often comorbid with mood disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med> can help stabilize <sym>mood swings</sym> and improve <sym>sleep patterns</sym>.\n\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider a combination of <med>mood stabilizers</med>, such as lithium or valproic acid, and <med>antipsychotics</med> to manage manic symptoms. <med>Antidepressants</med> may be added cautiously to treat depressive episodes, but must be monitored closely to avoid triggering mania.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>consistency</sym>. This may include maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n\n4. **Substance Use Monitoring:** Closely monitor and address <sym>substance misuse</sym>, including the use of painkillers beyond prescription. Consider <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment if necessary.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> given the patient's thoughts about death. Develop a safety plan and ensure access to support resources.\n\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage involvement of family and social support systems to help manage <sym>relationship struggles</sym> and provide a stable environment.",
