This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and any challenges you might be facing. Everything we discuss will be kept confidential and will help us create a safe space for you. There are 23 questions, and I'll ask each one in turn. Let's begin. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two weeks?"

Specific symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and a loss of identity and social connections. Physical symptoms such as headaches, back pain, and general tension, along with cognitive difficulties, are also present. The patient's increased alcohol use for sleep warrants monitoring. Further evaluation and treatment planning should focus on managing PTSD, depressive symptoms, and potential substance use, with ongoing assessment for suicidal ideation and the development of substance use disorder.",

The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linked to DSM-5 criteria.",

It's clear that the aftermath of your accident has been incredibly challenging, and it's understandable that you're feeling a mix of <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. The fact that you've been struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident, and a general sense of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and others is a lot to manage. It's also concerning to know that you've been coping with increased <sym>alcohol use</sym> to help with sleep. I'm here to help you navigate these difficulties and find a path to healing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>); <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>); <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> \u2013 Alcohol (<med>ASUD</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of a traumatic accident and the subsequent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the event, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to driving and accident reminders, and <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> are strongly indicative of <med>PTSD</med>. The <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>memory issues</sym> suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The increased <sym>alcohol use</sym> as a coping mechanism and sleep aid indicates a possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> \u2013 Alcohol.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>TF-CBT</med>) to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms. This can help manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <med>MDD</med> symptoms and <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) for <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, discuss the use of <med>benzodiazepines</med> or other <med>anxiolytics</med> for <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> management.\n3. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's <sym>alcohol use</sym> to determine if it meets the criteria for <med>ASUD</med> and develop a plan for management and potential treatment.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene and Management:** Implement sleep hygiene practices and evaluate the need for sleep aids other than alcohol to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Engage in <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>relationship difficulties</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and assess for any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or worsening of symptoms.",
