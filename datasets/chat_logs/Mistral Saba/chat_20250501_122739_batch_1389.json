It's clear that you've been struggling with a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness, and significant anxiety. You've also mentioned physical discomfort, memory issues, and feeling detached from yourself and others. These <sym>symptoms</sym> can be overwhelming, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in this journey. We'll work together to find ways to manage these challenges and improve your quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Moderate severity, with anxious distress.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> for a duration of over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behavior</sym> suggests the presence of anxious distress. The patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, such as headaches and back pain, and <sym>cognitive disturbances</sym>, like memory issues, are common in <med>MDD</med> but do not warrant a separate diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates that the severity of the <med>MDD</med> is at least moderate. Other diagnoses, such as <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, could be comorbid but are not the primary focus at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxious distress</med>. These evidence-based treatments can help manage <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, improve <sym>mood</sym>, and develop coping strategies.\n\n2. **Medication:** Discuss the potential benefits and side effects of <med>antidepressant medication</med> with the patient. Commonly prescribed medications include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> and <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through education on <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Stress Management:** Incorporate <med>stress management techniques</med> such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, and physical activity to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall <med>mental health</med>.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, as social support can play a crucial role in managing <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxious distress</med>. Group therapy or support groups may also be beneficial.\n\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> is essential. Develop a <med>safety plan</med> and monitor the patient's safety closely. Regular follow-ups and collaboration with other healthcare providers are crucial.\n\n7. **Medical Evaluation:** Rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>. A comprehensive medical evaluation can help ensure that all aspects of the patient's health are addressed.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a very challenging time, and I truly appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. It's clear that you've been struggling with a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness, and significant anxiety. You've also mentioned physical discomfort, memory issues, and feeling detached from yourself and others. These <sym>symptoms</sym> can be overwhelming, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in this journey. We'll work together to find ways to manage these challenges and improve your quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Moderate severity, with anxious distress.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> for a duration of over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behavior</sym> suggests the presence of anxious distress. The patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, such as headaches and back pain, and <sym>cognitive disturbances</sym>, like memory issues, are common in <med>MDD</med> but do not warrant a separate diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates that the severity of the <med>MDD</med> is at least moderate. Other diagnoses, such as <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, could be comorbid but are not the primary focus at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxious distress</med>. These evidence-based treatments can help manage <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, improve <sym>mood</sym>, and develop coping strategies.\n\n2. **Medication:** Discuss the potential benefits and side effects of <med>antidepressant medication</med> with the patient. Commonly prescribed medications include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> and <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through education on <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Stress Management:** Incorporate <med>stress management techniques</med> such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, and physical activity to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall <med>mental health</med>.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, as social support can play a crucial role in managing <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxious distress</med>. Group therapy or support groups may also be beneficial.\n\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> is essential. Develop a <med>safety plan</med> and monitor the patient's safety closely. Regular follow-ups and collaboration with other healthcare providers are crucial.\n\n7. **Medical Evaluation:** Rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>. A comprehensive medical evaluation can help ensure that all aspects of the patient's health are addressed.",
