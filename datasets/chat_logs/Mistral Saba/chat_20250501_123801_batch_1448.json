This assessment is designed to help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Your responses will be kept confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll start with the first one. Are you ready? Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Work's been stressful, and I don't really feel like doing much else. It's not that I don't want to do things, it's just... hard to muster the energy."

      "content": "Yes, definitely. I avoid going out alone, or even leaving the house sometimes. It's like I'm trapped in my own home. I know it's not rational, but I can't help it. I'm scared something bad will happen if I go out."

    {
      "role": "assistant",

    },

      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Yes, like checking things. I check if the doors are locked, if the stove is off, if my purse is with me. It's like I have to do it over and over until I feel like it's right. It's ridiculous, but I can't stop. It's like a compulsion."
