Anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry and avoidance behaviors, are also present. The patient exhibits significant impairment in daily functioning and social withdrawal. The absence of suicidal ideation is noted, but the presence of depressive symptoms and social withdrawal warrants ongoing assessment of suicide risk. The patient's reports of physical symptoms and perceived inadequate management should be further evaluated medically. Comprehensive treatment should target depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as the patient's psychosocial functioning.",

You've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy, and you've been feeling down and hopeless nearly every day. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>exhaustion</sym>, and <sym>memory problems</sym>. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and relationships, and it's understandable that you're feeling disconnected from others. You've also shared that you're in a lot of physical <sym>pain</sym>, which can be quite overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge the distress you're experiencing and to seek help to manage these <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxiety features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> (as evidenced by avoidance behaviors and lack of initiative), which are core <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym>, which suggest anxiety features. The patient's <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym> may also be related to <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. While the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, the presence of <sym>depression</med> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> should be monitored closely. The patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could be related to <med>depression</med> or <med>anxiety</med>, but a comprehensive medical evaluation is recommended to rule out any underlying medical conditions. The patient's <sym>symptoms</sym> meet criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxiety</med> features, but a definitive diagnosis should be made by a qualified mental health professional after further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <med>anxiety</med> <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Evaluation:** Assess and improve <sym>sleep</sym> habits to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Medical Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, as <sym>social withdrawal</sym> can exacerbate <sym>depression</sym> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust treatment as needed.",
