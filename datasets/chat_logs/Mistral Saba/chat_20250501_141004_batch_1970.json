Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms indicative of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder, with frequent episodes of intense fear, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbances. The patient's avoidance of triggering environments suggests possible comorbid Agoraphobia and Social Anxiety. There is a notable absence of psychotic features or substance use, but the patient's feelings of depersonalization and uncertainty about future coping mechanisms warrant close monitoring and support. The patient's perception of being misunderstood regarding their symptoms may contribute to feelings of isolation and distress, highlighting the need for a supportive and validating therapeutic environment. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on addressing these primary symptoms and ensuring the patient's safety and well-being.",

      "predicted": "You've been dealing with a great deal of emotional distress over the past two weeks, which has significantly impacted your daily life. You've described persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, with a noticeable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. This <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> is understandable, given the intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> you've been experiencing. These episodes of <sym>fear</sym> and <sym>discomfort</sym> have led you to avoid certain situations, further isolating you from social activities and relationships. It's commendable that you've been avoiding harmful coping mechanisms, such as substance use, but the <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> during panic attacks are concerning. Your perception of not being taken seriously about your <sym>illness</sym> can exacerbate feelings of distress, so it's crucial to address this in our work together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Possible Agoraphobia, Possible Social Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The avoidance of triggering environments and public transport suggests a possible <med>Agoraphobia</med>, while the withdrawal from social activities could indicate <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>constant feeling of sadness,</quote> <quote>intense panic,</quote> and <quote>depersonalization</quote> support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, focusing on thought patterns and behaviors that maintain these issues.\n2. Exposure Therapy to help manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to <med>Agoraphobia</med>.\n3. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques to improve <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>panic symptoms</sym>.\n4. Medication review to ensure optimal management of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and to discuss the possibility of adding or adjusting medication if necessary.\n5. Regular check-ins to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust the treatment plan as needed, ensuring the patient feels supported and validated in their experiences.\n6. Encourage social engagement and support, helping the patient reconnect with activities and people they enjoy, while managing <sym>anxiety</sym> triggers.",
