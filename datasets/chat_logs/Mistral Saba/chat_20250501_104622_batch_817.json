Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like muscle tension and digestive issues are likely interconnected with your emotional state. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> such as repetitive checking, and feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your life and identity.
