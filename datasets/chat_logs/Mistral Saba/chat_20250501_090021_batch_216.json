You've described a persistent loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, a pervasive sense of hopelessness, and frequent feelings of anxiety and worry. You also mentioned recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which have led to feelings of guilt and shame. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have not only affected your daily life but also your relationships and overall sense of self.

Additionally, the presence of recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors indicates a diagnosis of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is a significant concern that warrants immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the <med>diagnoses</med> and determine the best course of treatment.\n3. Consider a combination of <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) and <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) to manage <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n4. Recommend <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) to address the patient's feelings of detachment and relationship concerns.\n5. Monitor the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and consider referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> if necessary.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> to help the patient understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and develop coping strategies.\n7. Encourage regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n8. Consider referral to a support group for individuals with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> to provide additional support and resources.\n9. Assess the patient's <sym>memory issues</sym> and determine if further evaluation is needed to rule out other potential causes.",
