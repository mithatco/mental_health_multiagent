It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of emotional distress and physical discomfort, which can be overwhelming. It's clear that you're feeling <sym>depressed</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and disconnected from both yourself and others. You've mentioned <sym>hearing voices</sym>, <sym>feeling like people can read your mind</sym>, and having <sym>trouble sleeping</sym>, all of which can be very frightening and isolating. It's also concerning that you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, even if you don't intend to act on them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym>, <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> meet the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusions of thought insertion</sym> indicates <med>psychotic features</med>. The patient's <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support the complexity of the presentation. Given the severity of symptoms and the presence of <med>psychotic features</med>, a <med>Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features</med> is the most fitting diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychiatric Evaluation:</med> A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med> or <med>medical issues</med>.\n\n2. <med>Medication Management:</med> Consultation with a <med>psychiatrist</med> to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic</med> medications, which can help manage both the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <med>psychotic features</med>.\n\n3. <med>Psychotherapy:</med> <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Psychodynamic Therapy</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thoughts, and improve interpersonal skills. <med>Family therapy</med> may also be beneficial to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</med>.\n\n4. <med>Sleep Hygiene:</med> Addressing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. <med>Support Groups:</med> Encourage participation in <med>support groups</med> to provide a safe space to share experiences, gain insight, and reduce <sym>social isolation</med>.\n\n6. <med>Regular Follow-ups:</med> Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptom progression, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
