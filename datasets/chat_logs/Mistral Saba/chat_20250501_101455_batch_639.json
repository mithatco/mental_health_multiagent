Everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your feelings. There are 23 questions in total, and I will ask each one in turn.

Anxiety and panic attacks suggest a co-occurring anxiety disorder, potentially exacerbated by a past traumatic event. The patient\u2019s avoidance behaviors and intrusive thoughts indicate a possible PTSD diagnosis. The increase in alcohol use for sleep management raises concerns about substance use and its potential to worsen the underlying mental health issues. There is a risk of suicidal ideation, although currently not imminent. The patient's feelings of detachment and disconnection from self and others highlight a need for therapeutic interventions focused on re-establishing a sense of self and improving interpersonal connections. Further evaluation and multidisciplinary treatment planning are recommended.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was followed up with appropriate probing when concerning symptoms were mentioned, and no dimensions were skipped.

        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as thoughts of self-harm and increased alcohol use, and ensured a smooth conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria. Alternative diagnoses were considered, and the differential diagnosis was comprehensively addressed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

It's clear that you've been dealing with a significant amount of emotional and psychological distress since the accident. You've described feeling persistently <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a noticeable loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>increased irritability</sym> you've experienced are understandably challenging, and it's troubling to hear about the <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> you've been having. It's also concerning to hear about the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> you've had, even if they are not accompanied by a clear plan. Your efforts to cope with increased alcohol use are understandable, but it's important to address this as well.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder</med>, with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to the past accident, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>increased anxiety</sym> also suggest <med>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>generalized worry</sym> are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and the <sym>increased alcohol use</sym> raises concerns about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>PTSD</med> symptoms, focusing on trauma processing and cognitive restructuring.\n2. **Medication Management:** Evaluate the patient for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med> symptoms. Consider <med>Prazosin</med> for nightmares and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> related to <med>PTSD</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep quality</sym> through non-pharmacological methods, such as sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques.\n4. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's <sym>alcohol use</sym> and consider <med>motivational interviewing</med> and <med>relapse prevention strategies</med> to address <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> features.\n5. **Referral to <med>Support Groups</med>:** Encourage the patient's participation in <med>support groups</med> for trauma survivors and individuals struggling with <med>MDD</med> to foster a sense of community and shared understanding.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
