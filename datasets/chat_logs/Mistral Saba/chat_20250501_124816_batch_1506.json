You've also mentioned <sym>feeling detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, and having <sym>occasional thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which must be incredibly frightening and isolating. It's clear that you've been struggling, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> that are consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>depersonalization</sym> are also commonly associated with <med>depression</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> such as <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym> helps to rule out <med>bipolar disorder</med> or <med>psychotic depression</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> are consistent with co-occurring <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. However, the primary presentation is consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Given the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan to address any immediate risks.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible <med>antidepressant medication</med> to support <med>depression</med> treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to maintain open communication about any changes in <sym>mood</sym> or <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>.",

The patient reports significant depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, as well as anxiety symptoms such as excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors. The patient's sleep disturbances, memory issues, and feelings of detachment further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection from others are also concerning. The primary focus should be on assessing and mitigating the risk of suicidal ideation while addressing the underlying depressive and anxious symptoms. Further evaluation may be necessary to rule out co-occurring conditions such as dissociative disorders and substance use disorders.",

You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy, feel down and hopeless much of the time, and have been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. You've also mentioned <sym>feeling detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, and having <sym>occasional thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which must be incredibly frightening and isolating. It's clear that you've been struggling, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> that are consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>depersonalization</sym> are also commonly associated with <med>depression</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> such as <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym> helps to rule out <med>bipolar disorder</med> or <med>psychotic depression</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> are consistent with co-occurring <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. However, the primary presentation is consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Given the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan to address any immediate risks.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible <med>antidepressant medication</med> to support <med>depression</med> treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to maintain open communication about any changes in <sym>mood</sym> or <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>.",
