The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, and the justification was comprehensive. Alternative diagnoses were not explicitly ruled out, but the focus on PTSD was justified based on the information provided.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing the patient's use of alcohol, the therapist could have offered more emotional support. However, overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and acknowledged the patient's distress."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation was exceptionally well-structured and clinically thorough. The therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively used it to guide the assessment. The only areas for improvement are in showing more empathy during certain disclosures and potentially probing some symptoms more deeply. Overall, this was a highly competent and professional interaction.",

You've expressed a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, feelings of depression and hopelessness, and increased irritability. You're also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which seem to be triggered by reminders of a past accident. It's understandable that you might feel disconnected from others and yourself, and it's concerning that you've turned to alcohol to help cope. Your physical discomfort and feelings of not being taken seriously add to the complexity of your situation. It's commendable that you've reached out for support, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts related to a past accident, hypervigilance, and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms triggered by accident reminders suggest <med>PTSD</med>. The <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with <med>PTSD</med>. The patient's use of alcohol to cope with stress and <sym>sleep issues</sym> is concerning and may indicate an emerging <med>substance use disorder</med>.
