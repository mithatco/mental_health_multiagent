These symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, possibly coexisting with an Anxiety Disorder and a Dissociative Disorder. The patient's suicidal ideation, social isolation, and cognitive issues are significant risk factors that require immediate attention. Further diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning are essential to address these symptoms and mitigate potential risks.",
