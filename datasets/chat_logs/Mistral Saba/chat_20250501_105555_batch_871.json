It sounds like you've been going through a tough time, with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety dominating your days. You've also mentioned that you're sleeping a lot but not feeling rested, having trouble focusing, and feeling disconnected from yourself and your relationships. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life and your sense of self. It's important to acknowledge this is a challenging situation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (hypersomnia), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (memory and concentration problems), and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>. These symptoms are consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>frequent worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which justify the addition of <med>anxiety features</med>. The <sym>identity questions</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support the depressive component and overall <med>functional impairment</med>. The patient's report of <sym>occasional suicidal ideation</sym> warrants immediate attention and is a critical factor in the diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, an immediate safety assessment is crucial. This includes evaluating the patient's support system, access to means of harm, and developing a safety plan.\n2. **Referral to a Mental Health Professional:** The patient should be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning. This may include <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address both <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. **Medication Review:** If the patient is currently taking any medications, a review is necessary to ensure they are appropriate and effective. Consideration should be given to starting or adjusting <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Given the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, educating the patient on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices can be beneficial. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. **Cognitive and Behavioral Interventions:** Addressing <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and <sym>identity questions</sym> through <med>cognitive restructuring</med> and <med>mindfulness</med> practices can help the patient regain a sense of self and improve focus.\n6. **Social Support and Engagement:** Encouraging the patient to reconnect with social supports and gradually engage in social activities can help combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>. This can be facilitated through group therapy or peer support groups.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate your willingness to share openly about what you've been experiencing. It sounds like you've been going through a tough time, with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety dominating your days. You've also mentioned that you're sleeping a lot but not feeling rested, having trouble focusing, and feeling disconnected from yourself and your relationships. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life and your sense of self. It's important to acknowledge this is a challenging situation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (hypersomnia), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (memory and concentration problems), and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>. These symptoms are consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>frequent worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which justify the addition of <med>anxiety features</med>. The <sym>identity questions</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support the depressive component and overall <med>functional impairment</med>. The patient's report of <sym>occasional suicidal ideation</sym> warrants immediate attention and is a critical factor in the diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, an immediate safety assessment is crucial. This includes evaluating the patient's support system, access to means of harm, and developing a safety plan.\n2. **Referral to a Mental Health Professional:** The patient should be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning. This may include <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address both <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. **Medication Review:** If the patient is currently taking any medications, a review is necessary to ensure they are appropriate and effective. Consideration should be given to starting or adjusting <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Given the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, educating the patient on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices can be beneficial. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. **Cognitive and Behavioral Interventions:** Addressing <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and <sym>identity questions</sym> through <med>cognitive restructuring</med> and <med>mindfulness</med> practices can help the patient regain a sense of self and improve focus.\n6. **Social Support and Engagement:** Encouraging the patient to reconnect with social supports and gradually engage in social activities can help combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>. This can be facilitated through group therapy or peer support groups.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
