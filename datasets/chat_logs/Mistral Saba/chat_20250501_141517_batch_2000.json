The patient\u2019s interpersonal difficulties and feelings of detachment further contribute to her overall distress. Her report of having had thoughts of hurting herself necessitates careful monitoring for suicide risk.

The emotional turmoil you're experiencing is evident in your feelings of depression, anxiety, and the difficulties you're having with sleep and your relationships.

The patient also mentions having had thoughts of hurting herself, although she has not acted on them, which is a concerning sign that requires careful monitoring.
