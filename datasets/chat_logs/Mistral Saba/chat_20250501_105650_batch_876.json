Anxiety symptoms, including generalized anxiety and panic attacks, are also present, with corresponding avoidance behaviors. Somatic symptoms and feelings of depersonalization/derealization suggest potential comorbidity with an anxiety disorder or dissociative symptoms. The patient reports suicidal ideation, indicating a significant risk factor for self-harm. Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection from relationships further complicate the clinical picture. Comprehensive assessment and intervention, including safety planning and cognitive-behavioral strategies, are recommended to address these symptoms and mitigate risks.",

      "predicted": "You've been experiencing a lot of <sym>difficult emotions</sym> and <sym>challenges</sym> lately. It's clear that you've been feeling <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, and that you're not enjoying the things you used to. You've mentioned that you're feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, and that you've even been having <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's also concerning that you've been having <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. You've described <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. It's understandable that you might feel like <quote>people don't understand how I'm feeling</quote>, and that you're feeling <sym>lost</sym> and <sym>disconnected</sym> from your life and relationships. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences are real and valid, and that you deserve support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pervasive <sym>mood</sym> disturbance characterized by <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in daily activities, which aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including <sym>generalized anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, suggests co-occurring <med>anxiety</med> features. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> further support the diagnosis. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is a serious concern and warrants immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Planning:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to implement a comprehensive safety plan. This includes identifying triggers, developing coping strategies, and establishing a support network.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication Management:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication to manage <sym>severe symptoms</sym>. Close monitoring and follow-up are essential.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through sleep hygiene education and potential use of <med>sleep aids</med> if necessary.\n5. **Neuropsychological Assessment:** Consider a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to evaluate <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and rule out any underlying neurological conditions.\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support systems, such as family and friends, and consider participation in support groups.\n7. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
