You've been struggling with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>memory</sym>, and <sym>energy</sym> levels, and you feel disconnected from yourself and others. You've also mentioned <sym>aches and pains</sym> and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which can be very frightening. It's clear that these feelings are taking a toll on your daily life and your ability to function. You've been dealing with a lot, and it's important to address these feelings and find ways to help you feel better. You mentioned that you just want to feel like yourself again, and I understand that this is a challenging situation. It's great that you've reached out, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (particularly early morning awakening), <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (including <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>decreased focus</sym>), and <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> (decreased energy and motivation). These symptoms have persisted for an extended period, indicating a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The absence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusions</sym> rules out <med>schizophrenia</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</med> are also consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. However, the predominance of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and the <quote>persistent negative affect</quote> lead to a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent)</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist or primary care physician for <med>antidepressant medication</med> management. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient to a mental health professional for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Given the <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>decreased focus</sym>, consider referral to a neuropsychologist for <med>cognitive rehabilitation</med> to address these <sym>neurocognitive</sym> difficulties.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends, family, or support groups to address <sym>withdrawal</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym>. Social connections can provide emotional support and help improve mood.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor the patient's symptoms and treatment response. Adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress and any emerging <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or other <sym>concerns</sym>.\n\n7. **Educate the patient on <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>**: Ensure the patient understands that while somatic symptoms are real and distressing, they may be related to <med>depression</med> or <med>anxiety</med>. This can help the patient manage expectations and avoid unnecessary medical tests or treatments.",

There are also features of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, including excessive worry and avoidance behaviors. Somatic symptoms, including headaches and generalized aches, and dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization and feelings of detachment, are also present. The patient reports no current substance use or misuse, but there is a history of suicidal ideation without intent. Cognitive difficulties, including memory problems and decreased focus, suggest potential neurocognitive impairment. The patient's withdrawal from social activities and relationships, coupled with persistent negative self-evaluations, indicates a significant impact on social and occupational functioning. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment and a multimodal treatment approach to address the patient's symptoms and improve quality of life.",

      "predicted": "**Compassionate Summary:**\n\nIt sounds like you've been going through a really tough time. You've described feeling <sym>down</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and <sym>anxious</sym>, with little interest in the things you used to enjoy. You've been struggling with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>memory</sym>, and <sym>energy</sym> levels, and you feel disconnected from yourself and others. You've also mentioned <sym>aches and pains</sym> and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which can be very frightening. It's clear that these feelings are taking a toll on your daily life and your ability to function. You've been dealing with a lot, and it's important to address these feelings and find ways to help you feel better. You mentioned that you just want to feel like yourself again, and I understand that this is a challenging situation. It's great that you've reached out, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (particularly early morning awakening), <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (including <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>decreased focus</sym>), and <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> (decreased energy and motivation). These symptoms have persisted for an extended period, indicating a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The absence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusions</sym> rules out <med>schizophrenia</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</med> are also consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. However, the predominance of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and the <quote>persistent negative affect</quote> lead to a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent)</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist or primary care physician for <med>antidepressant medication</med> management. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) could be beneficial.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient to a mental health professional for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Given the <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>decreased focus</sym>, consider referral to a neuropsychologist for <med>cognitive rehabilitation</med> to address these <sym>neurocognitive</sym> difficulties.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends, family, or support groups to address <sym>withdrawal</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym>. Social connections can provide emotional support and help improve mood.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor the patient's symptoms and treatment response. Adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress and any emerging <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or other <sym>concerns</sym>.\n\n7. **Educate the patient on <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>**: Ensure the patient understands that while somatic symptoms are real and distressing, they may be related to <med>depression</med> or <med>anxiety</med>. This can help the patient manage expectations and avoid unnecessary medical tests or treatments.",
