Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe and supportive environment for you. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I'll ask each one of them in turn. Let's begin with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

You've described feeling persistently <sym>sad</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and <sym>empty</sym>, with a notable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as socializing with friends. <quote>\"It just feels like I can't shake this feeling of sadness\"</quote>. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including early morning awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, as well as <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like memory issues. Additionally, you've felt <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings at times, and you've had <sym>occasional thoughts</sym> of self-harm. It's clear that these experiences have been affecting your daily life and your sense of self.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (recurrent, severe, without <sym>psychotic features</sym>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <quote>\"feelings of emptiness, sadness, and hopelessness\"</quote>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>occasional suicidal ideation</sym>. These symptoms meet the criteria for a <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The severity of symptoms, as indicated by the significant impairment in functioning and the degree of distress, suggests a severe presentation. There is no evidence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> such as <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, which rules out <med>major depressive disorder with psychotic features</med>. The patient's <sym>identity disturbance</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> may be secondary to the <med>depression</med>, but they do not warrant a separate diagnosis at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n3. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, as well as to improve <sym>cognitive functioning</sym> and <sym>interpersonal skills</sym>.\n4. Prescribe <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) as a first-line treatment.\n5. Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and, if necessary, <med>pharmacological interventions</med>.\n6. Monitor the patient's progress regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n7. Consider referral to a <med>neurologist</med> to rule out any underlying <med>neurological conditions</med> that could be contributing to <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n8. Provide education and support to the patient and their family about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, its <sym>symptoms</sym>, and treatment options.",
