        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist followed up with questions about depression and hopelessness. Similarly, the therapist explored anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive thoughts comprehensively.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for 'excessive worry' and 'avoidance behaviors,' the therapist used language that directly corresponded to Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. For example, after the patient disclosed panic attacks, the therapist logically followed up with questions about anxiety and avoidance behaviors, demonstrating a smooth transition in the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific patient symptoms to DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The justification provided was comprehensive and directly tied to the patient's reported symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For instance, when the patient expressed feelings of hopelessness, the therapist responded with understanding and continued the conversation in a supportive manner."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional coverage of DSM-5 dimensions, clinical relevance, consistency, diagnostic justification, and empathy. The therapist systematically explored all 23 dimensions, used clinically precise language, and maintained a logical and empathetic conversational flow. The diagnostic justifications were comprehensive and directly tied to DSM-5 criteria. Overall, this conversation represents a model of effective and thorough clinical assessment.",
