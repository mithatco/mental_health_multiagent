You've also been experiencing a lot of anxiety and have been avoiding social situations because of it. Sleep issues, memory problems, and unexplained physical pains have added to your distress. It's also concerning that you've had thoughts of harming yourself, although you've not acted on them. I'm here to help you navigate through these challenges and find a path towards better mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Substance Use Disorder (painkillers)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent<sym> depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The patient's misuse of painkillers and attempts to stop suggests <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further underscores the severity of the patient's condition and the need for immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address the symptoms of <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and potential pharmacotherapy. Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Substance Use Treatment:** Refer the patient to a <med>substance use disorder (SUD)</med> specialist for a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan. This may include <med>medication-assisted treatment (MAT)</med> and <med>therapy</med> to address the misuse of painkillers.\n4. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</med>. This should include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a strong support system. Social connections can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling down and hopeless, which makes it difficult to find joy in things you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing a lot of anxiety and have been avoiding social situations because of it. Sleep issues, memory problems, and unexplained physical pains have added to your distress. It's also concerning that you've had thoughts of harming yourself, although you've not acted on them. I'm here to help you navigate through these challenges and find a path towards better mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Substance Use Disorder (painkillers)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent<sym> depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The patient's misuse of painkillers and attempts to stop suggests <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further underscores the severity of the patient's condition and the need for immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address the symptoms of <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and potential pharmacotherapy. Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Substance Use Treatment:** Refer the patient to a <med>substance use disorder (SUD)</med> specialist for a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan. This may include <med>medication-assisted treatment (MAT)</med> and <med>therapy</med> to address the misuse of painkillers.\n4. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</med>. This should include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n6. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a strong support system. Social connections can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
