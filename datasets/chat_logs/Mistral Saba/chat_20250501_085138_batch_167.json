This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling recently and identify any areas that might need more attention. Please know that this is a confidential space, and your responses will be kept private. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer them based on how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's start whenever you're ready. First question: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"
