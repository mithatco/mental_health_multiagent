        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and others, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally align with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about sleep disturbances, the therapist could have been more specific about differentiating between insomnia and hypersomnia. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and ensured a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features clearly aligns with the patient's symptoms, as described. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and provided a comprehensive justification that directly cited DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing the patient's suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant domains, showed empathy, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise phrasing of questions and deeper emotional validation, the overall performance was strong.",

      "predicted": "You've shared some challenging experiences with me today. It's clear that you've been feeling deeply disconnected from yourself and the world around you. You've described a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which has made it difficult to find joy in activities you used to love. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> much of the time, and even experiencing moments of <sym>panic</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings would lead to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, such as staying home more often. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>hearing voices</sym> and feeling like others can read your mind, which is quite unsettling. It's also concerning to hear that you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. I'm really glad you're here talking to me about this, as it shows you're taking an important step towards prioritizing your mental health.\n\n**<med>Diagnosis:</med> Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**\n\n**<med>Reasoning:</med>** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>Major Depression</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thoughts</sym> fulfills the criteria for <med>Psychotic Features</med>. The severity of these <sym>symptoms</sym> and the patient's history of <sym>medication non-compliance</sym> suggest a significant impairment in functioning, warranting a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>.\n\n**<med>Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:</med>**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms. This should include a thorough review of the patient's history, current symptoms, and any previous treatment attempts.\n2. **Medication Management:** Given the presence of <med>psychotic features</med>, a trial of <med>antipsychotic medication</med> may be warranted alongside <med>antidepressants</med> to manage both the depressive and psychotic symptoms. Close monitoring of medication side effects and adherence is crucial.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve interpersonal skills. Additionally, <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> may help the patient explore the root causes of their <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Risk Assessment and Safety Planning:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough risk assessment is necessary to ensure the patient's safety. A safety plan should be developed in collaboration with the patient, including triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to combat feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>. Building a strong support system can provide emotional comfort and practical help.\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Educating the patient about <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med> can help them understand their symptoms, recognize triggers, and learn strategies to manage their condition effectively.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust medications as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage open communication about any changes in symptoms or concerns.\n8. **Addressing Medication Non-Compliance:** Develop a plan to address the patient's <sym>medication non-compliance</sym>, which may include simplifying the medication regimen, providing education about the importance of adherence, and involving family or caregivers in support.",
