These symptoms suggest the potential for co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, as well as substance use issues. The presence of suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms are particularly concerning and require immediate clinical attention. The patient's use of avoidance and substance use as coping mechanisms further complicates the clinical picture. A comprehensive evaluation and multidisciplinary approach are warranted to address these multifaceted symptoms effectively.",
