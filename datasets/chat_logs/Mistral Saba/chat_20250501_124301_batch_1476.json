The presence of excessive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worries</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.

The patient\u2019s somatic complaints and occasional dissociative symptoms warrant further investigation to rule out any underlying medical conditions or somatization. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent and the patient\u2019s reports of anxiety and panic attacks indicate a need for immediate attention and intervention. The patient\u2019s identity crisis and social withdrawal further underline the need for comprehensive support and therapeutic intervention to manage these symptoms effectively. Further diagnostic evaluations, including a clinical interview and possibly lab work, are recommended to fully assess the patient\u2019s mental and physical health.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped.

The therapist phrased questions in clinically accurate ways that align with DSM-5 terminology and did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning. The language used was precise and aligned with clinical criteria.",

The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured smooth transitions and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cite specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis explicitly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state and acknowledged patient distress without being overly technical."

      "predicted": "I appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences and feelings with me. It's clear that you've been going through a lot, especially since your divorce. You've mentioned feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. You also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that have been impacting your daily life. It sounds like you've been sleeping a lot but still feeling exhausted, which is concerning. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, and you mentioned feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's also evident that you've been going through an <sym>identity crisis</sym>, questioning who you are and what you want out of life. These symptoms are clearly affecting your quality of life, and it's important to address them with the help of a professional.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation without intent</sym> are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of excessive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worries</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Given the timing of these symptoms following the patient's divorce, an <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood</med> is also warranted. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient cope with the divorce and related losses.\n\n2. **Medication Management**: Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and potential <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> and potentially refer to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n4. **Somatic Symptom Management**: Evaluate <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Consider <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to manage stress-related <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n\n5. **Identity Exploration**: Encourage the patient to explore their <sym>identity crisis</sym> through <med>psychotherapy</med>, potentially with a focus on existential or humanistic approaches.\n\n6. **Support System**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with their support system, including friends and family, and consider support groups for individuals going through similar experiences.\n\n7. **Follow-Up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
