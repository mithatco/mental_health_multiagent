You've expressed a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities, feelings of depression and hopelessness, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. You've also mentioned experiencing panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive behaviors. Additionally, you've shared feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your identity, as well as a sense of isolation in your relationships. It's understandable that these experiences can be very challenging and affect your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <med>obsessive-compulsive</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> suggests a major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates a coexisting <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> are consistent with <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym> may suggest <med>depersonalization/derealization</med> features or a personality disorder. However, the primary clinical picture is that of a major depressive disorder with significant anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features. This can include exposure and response prevention (ERP) for the <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (SNRIs), to manage depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n4. Monitor the patient closely for any signs of suicidal ideation or intent, given the patient's report of thoughts of self-harm.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle, as these can have a positive impact on mood and anxiety levels.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help the patient understand their condition and manage expectations for treatment.\n7. Consider referral to a <med>support group</med> or <med>psychoeducational group</med> to provide additional support and resources.\n8. Regularly review and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress and feedback.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. You've expressed a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities, feelings of depression and hopelessness, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. You've also mentioned experiencing panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive behaviors. Additionally, you've shared feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your identity, as well as a sense of isolation in your relationships. It's understandable that these experiences can be very challenging and affect your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <med>obsessive-compulsive</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> suggests a major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates a coexisting <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> are consistent with <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym> may suggest <med>depersonalization/derealization</med> features or a personality disorder. However, the primary clinical picture is that of a major depressive disorder with significant anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features. This can include exposure and response prevention (ERP) for the <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (SNRIs), to manage depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n4. Monitor the patient closely for any signs of suicidal ideation or intent, given the patient's report of thoughts of self-harm.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle, as these can have a positive impact on mood and anxiety levels.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help the patient understand their condition and manage expectations for treatment.\n7. Consider referral to a <med>support group</med> or <med>psychoeducational group</med> to provide additional support and resources.\n8. Regularly review and adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's progress and feedback.",
