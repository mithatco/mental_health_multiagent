Key symptoms include:\n- **Depressive Symptoms**: Loss of interest and pleasure, feelings of hopelessness and heaviness, irritability, and fatigue.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms**: Preoccupation with negative thoughts, feeling on edge, frequent worry, and panic attacks.\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: Difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep, with a racing mind.\n- **Somatic Symptoms**: Persistent tension in shoulders and neck, and occasional stomachaches.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Traits**: Repetitive checking behaviors such as verifying that doors are locked or the stove is off.\n\n#### Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n- **Consistent Themes**: The patient frequently mentions feelings of anxiety, worry, and inability to relax. There is a consistent theme of feeling overwhelmed and unable to control thoughts and emotions.\n- **Avoidance Behaviors**: The patient has begun to avoid social situations due to anxiety, such as avoiding the gym.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms**: The patient reports intrusive thoughts and a difficulty in focusing on tasks due to racing thoughts and worries.\n\n#### Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n- **Presence of Depression**: The patient's loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability suggest a depressive episode.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's persistent feelings of anxiety, worry, and physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., tension, racing thoughts) are indicative of this condition.\n- **Panic Attacks**: The patient's description of racing heart and shortness of breath during episodes of panic.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**: Repetitive checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts of things that could go wrong.\n- **Sleep Disturbance**: The patient's difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep quality, which may exacerbate other symptoms.\n\n#### Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient has had thoughts of not wanting to live, although there is no indication of suicidal intent or plan.\n- **Avoidance Behaviors**: Avoidance of social situations due to anxiety, which can lead to further isolation and exacerbation of symptoms.\n- **Physical Health**: Somatic symptoms such as tension and stomachaches may worsen without intervention and could also be indicators of underlying physical health issues.\n\n#### Summary\nThe patient presents with a complex set of symptoms that include depressive features, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and possible obsessive-compulsive traits. The patient's sleep disturbances and physical symptoms, such as tension and stomachaches, add to the clinical picture. The patient's avoidance behaviors and occasional suicidal ideation without intent or plan warrant careful monitoring. The patient's inability to control intrusive thoughts and feelings of hopelessness, coupled with the avoidance of social situations, suggests a significant level of distress. A comprehensive assessment and a multi-faceted treatment plan addressing both cognitive and behavioral components of the patient's symptoms are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You've shared some very challenging experiences recently, and it's clear that you've been feeling overwhelmed. It sounds like you've been struggling with a <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>increased irritability</sym>. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> seems to be quite pervasive, making it difficult for you to relax or focus. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like tension and stomachaches, and some <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym> that may be causing you concern. It's understandable that you're feeling lost and uncertain about your future. I appreciate your openness in sharing these details, as it will help us create a plan to support you better.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Traits**\n\n**Reasoning:** Your report of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feeling hopeless</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> due to <sym>anxiety</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>severe</med> <med>Anxious Distress</med>. Additionally, your <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> suggest <med>obsessive-compulsive personality traits</med>. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> are met as you have experienced <sym>multiple significant depressive symptoms</sym> nearly every day for more than two weeks, causing <sym>clinical distress</sym> and <sym>impairment</sym> in your <sym>social and occupational functioning</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. CBT can also address <med>obsessive-compulsive personality traits</med> by helping you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss the potential benefits of <med>antidepressant</med> medication to alleviate <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> are commonly used for these symptoms and may also help with <sym>obsessive-compulsive</sym> behaviors.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment.\n\n4. **Stress Management:** Engage in regular <med>stress management</med> techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga to help reduce <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n\n5. **Support Network:** Encourage connecting with a support network, whether it's friends, family, or support groups, to help you feel less isolated and more supported during this challenging time.\n\n6. **Monitoring of Symptoms:** Regularly monitor your <sym>symptoms</sym> and any <sym>changes in mood</sym> or <sym>behavior</sym>. Keep a journal to track <sym>thoughts</sym>, <sym>emotions</sym>, and <sym>behaviors</sym> to share with your mental health provider for better insight and treatment planning.",
