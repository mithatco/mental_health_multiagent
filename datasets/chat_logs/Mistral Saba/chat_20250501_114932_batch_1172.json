      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling down, hopeless, and lacking interest in activities you used to enjoy. You're experiencing increased irritability, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and even occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's also clear that you've been feeling physically unwell and have had some <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches. You've been distancing yourself from others and feeling disconnected from your surroundings, which must be quite challenging. It's understandable that you're feeling this way, and it's important to recognize that these feelings are real and valid.\n\n**Diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, which are consistent with a <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient also experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> that are often comorbid with <med>depression</med>. The patient's feelings of detachment and identity disturbance, along with social withdrawal, further support this diagnosis. While <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> are also considerations, the primary presenting symptoms and the patient's description of their experiences align more closely with a <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based therapies can help the patient manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. These therapies can also address the patient's feelings of detachment and identity disturbance.\n2. **Medication:** Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms. It's important to monitor the patient's response to medication and adjust as needed.\n3. **Lifestyle Changes:** Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep routine to improve overall well-being.\n4. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family or seek support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.",
