This assessment will help us understand how you're feeling and where we might need to focus our attention. Your answers will be kept confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer each one based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through an incredibly challenging time. You've lost interest in activities you once enjoyed, you're feeling down and hopeless, and you're constantly on edge, experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's understandable that you might be feeling this way, given how intense these experiences can be. You've also been sleeping a lot but still feeling exhausted, which can make it even harder to cope. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are significantly impacting your daily life, and it's important to address them to help you regain a sense of control and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> for more than two weeks, which are key symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> <reference>DSM-5</reference>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>recurrent panic attacks</sym> accompanied by <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as chest tightness, which are indicative of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in specific situations also suggest a potential <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. However, the primary concerns are the persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which warrant a focus on <med>MDD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym> experienced during panic attacks further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This therapeutic approach can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with <med>MDD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Techniques such as exposure therapy can help the patient gradually face and manage <sym>anxiety</sym>-triggering situations.\n2. **Medication:** Consideration of <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are often effective for both <med>MDD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n3. **Lifestyle Changes:** Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and establish a consistent sleep routine to improve overall well-being and <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family or join support groups to reduce feelings of <sym>social isolation</sym> and <sym>withdrawal</sym>.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This will help ensure that the patient is receiving the appropriate support and that the <sym>symptoms</sym> are being effectively managed.",
