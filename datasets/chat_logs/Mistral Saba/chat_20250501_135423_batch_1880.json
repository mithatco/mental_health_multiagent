CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible pharmacotherapy. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be beneficial for managing both <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on maintaining good sleep hygiene to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include strategies such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bed.\n4. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> to ensure the patient's safety.

      "predicted": "It is deeply concerning to hear that you have been experiencing a range of challenging <sym>symptoms</sym> over the past few weeks. You've described a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, increased irritability, and disrupted sleep patterns. The anxiety you've been feeling seems to be overwhelming, and you've even experienced moments of panic. It's understandable that these <sym>symptoms</sym> would make you feel disconnected from yourself and others, as well as lead to moments of feeling like hurting yourself, though thankfully you haven't acted on these thoughts. It's clear that you're going through a difficult time, and it's important to address these issues comprehensively.\n\n***Diagnosis:***\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features\n\n***Reasoning:***\nThe patient's report of persistent <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> points towards a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's history of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> should also be considered in the context of these diagnoses.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive features</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible pharmacotherapy. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be beneficial for managing both <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on maintaining good sleep hygiene to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include strategies such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bed.\n4. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> to ensure the patient's safety. Establish a safety plan and provide contact information for crisis support services.\n5. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider involvement in support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n6. **Assessment for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>:** If <sym>somatoform</sym> symptoms persist, assess for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and provide education on managing these symptoms.\n7. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's substance use history and provide education on the risks of non-prescribed painkiller use.",
