It sounds like you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately, with a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and a <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy. You've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and even <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which can be incredibly frightening. It's also clear that these feelings are affecting your relationships and your overall sense of self. You've also mentioned <sym>uneasiness about unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> such as excessive hand-washing, which can be very distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>), <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>), <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>), and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (<med>SSD</med>) provisionally.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> which are consistent with <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests <med>GAD</med>. The patient's <sym>compulsive hand-washing behavior</sym> indicates <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>uneasiness</sym> about <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> and the feeling that their health is not taken seriously suggests <med>SSD</med>. The symptoms have been present for at least six months, meeting the duration criteria for these disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Further Assessment:** Conduct a more detailed clinical interview to gather more information about the onset, duration, and severity of the symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>, and <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (<med>ERP</med>) for <med>OCD</med>. Consider <med>Insight-Oriented Psychotherapy</med> to address the <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n3. **Medication:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for medication management, which may include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>, and possibly <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) for <med>OCD</med>.\n4. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, given the presence of <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n5. **Education:** Provide psychoeducation about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>OCD</med>, and <med>SSD</med> to help the patient understand their conditions and the available treatments.\n6. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends and family for support and to consider <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address the <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> in relationships.\n7. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommend regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to support overall mental health.",
