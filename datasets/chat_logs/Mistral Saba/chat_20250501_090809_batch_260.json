You've mentioned that you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy, and you often feel down, hopeless, and irritable. You've also expressed feelings of anxiety and avoidance of certain situations. Additionally, you've been struggling with sleep issues, obsessive thoughts, and compulsive behaviors. It's clear that these symptoms have been affecting your ability to connect with others and your overall quality of life. It's important to address these feelings and find ways to manage them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core features of <med>major depressive disorder</med>.

The absence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>, <med>suicidal ideation</med>, and <med>substance use</med> is reassuring but does not preclude these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. CBT can help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n2. **Medication:** Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</med> (SNRIs) to help manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Alternatively, a <med>trial of antidepressants</med> can be considered to help with <med>OCD</med> traits.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Social Support:** Encourage engagement in social activities and support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve <sym>relationships</sym> with others.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Promote <med>healthy lifestyle changes</med> such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques to support overall mental health.",
