      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness and honesty in sharing your experiences. It's clear that you've been feeling <sym>down, depressed, and hopeless</sym> for several days now, and you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy. This must be incredibly challenging, and I'm here to help you navigate through this. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious and worried</sym> almost every day, with occasional episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. These <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> can be overwhelming, and it's understandable that you've been trying to avoid situations that trigger them. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and you've expressed feelings of <sym>detachment and isolation</sym> from yourself and others. It's also concerning that you've had <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, even if they haven't crossed over into serious intent. I'm glad you've reached out for support, as this is an important first step in addressing these issues.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n<med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n<med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a persistent depressed mood, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient also reports persistent <sym>anxiety and worry</sym> about everyday issues, which are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> that are causing significant distress and disruption in functioning point towards <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)</med>. The patient's report of feeling that people can read their mind and feeling detached from surroundings also suggests <med>Depersonalization/Derealization</med>. The patient's occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the urgency for a thorough evaluation and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>SSD</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, as well as challenge and modify <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> related to somatic symptoms.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be prescribed to manage symptoms of <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n\n3. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough psychiatric evaluation is essential to assess the severity and mitigate any immediate risks. This evaluation should include a detailed assessment of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, intent, and any protective factors.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Encourage regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to support overall mental health. These interventions can complement psychotherapy and medication management.\n\n5. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's substance use, including the misuse of painkillers and alcohol. Develop a plan to address any <med>Substance Use Disorders</med> and promote healthier coping mechanisms.\n\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Involve family members or close friends in the treatment process to provide additional support and understanding. Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and build a support network.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's well-being.",
