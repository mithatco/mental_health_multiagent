We'll go through 23 questions, and it's important to answer them as honestly as possible. Let's begin. How much have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

Additionally, there are significant anxiety symptoms, dissociative features, and somatic complaints. The patient exhibits avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, which may be contributing to the overall distress. Further assessment is warranted to rule out other potential diagnoses and to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.",

The <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>feelings of sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> have significantly impacted your daily life. You've also been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. These <symptoms> are understandable responses to the emotional turmoil you're experiencing, and it's important to address them with care and professional support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>I've definitely lost interest in things I used to enjoy... It's like I just don't have the energy or motivation to do them anymore</quote>). These symptoms, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I've been sleeping a lot more but still feel exhausted</quote>), <sym>irritability</sym> (<quote>I snap at people more easily now</quote>), and <sym>feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</sym> (<quote>I don't know if it's normal</quote>), strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Collaborate with a <med>psychiatrist</med> for medication monitoring and adjustments.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep</sym> quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to build a support network and engage in social activities, even if it feels difficult at first. This can help combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan, and make adjustments as needed.\n\n6. **Explore Additional Resources:** Consider referring the patient to support groups, workshops, or other resources that focus on <med>mental health</med> and wellness.",
