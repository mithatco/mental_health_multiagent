It's clear that you've been struggling with a range of <sym>emotional and physical symptoms</sym> that have significantly impacted your daily life. You've described a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also experienced frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which have led to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as headaches and abdominal pain, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> during panic attacks. It's understandable that these symptoms have left you feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your personal identity and future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Panic Disorder with <med>Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your description of recurrent, unexpected <sym>panic attacks</sym> accompanied by <sym>fear of losing control</sym> or <sym>dying</sym>, along with <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as staying away from public transport and crowded places, strongly suggests <med>Panic Disorder with <med>Agoraphobia</med>. Additionally, your persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of pleasure</sym> in activities, and <sym>depression</sym> indicate a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> may be associated with the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>, or may warrant further evaluation for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> if they persist despite treatment. The <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> may be related to the <med>Panic Disorder</med> or could indicate a co-occurring disorder. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> is noted, but ongoing monitoring is necessary given your feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Psychotherapy: <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) is recommended to address the <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. <med>CBT</med> can help you manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</med>, and also address the <sym>depressive symptoms</med>.\n2. Medication management: Consultation with a psychiatrist for <med>medication</med> management is recommended. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial for both the <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, a short-term course of <med>benzodiazepines</med> may be considered for <sym>panic attack</med> management, but should be used cautiously due to the risk of dependence.\n3. Sleep hygiene education: Addressing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and, if necessary, <med>sleep medication</med> management can improve overall well-being and <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n4. Psychosocial support: Encourage reconnection with social support networks, such as friends and family, to alleviate <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Support groups for individuals with <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Depression</med> may also be beneficial.\n5. Monitoring and follow-up: Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, medication effectiveness, and overall well-being. Adjust treatment plan as needed based on your response to interventions.\n6. Evaluation for co-occurring disorders: If <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> persist, evaluate for co-occurring <med>Personality Disorders</med> or <med>Dissociative Disorders</med>.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate your honesty and courage in sharing your experiences with me today. It's clear that you've been struggling with a range of <sym>emotional and physical symptoms</sym> that have significantly impacted your daily life. You've described a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also experienced frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which have led to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as headaches and abdominal pain, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> during panic attacks. It's understandable that these symptoms have left you feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your personal identity and future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Panic Disorder with <med>Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your description of recurrent, unexpected <sym>panic attacks</sym> accompanied by <sym>fear of losing control</sym> or <sym>dying</sym>, along with <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as staying away from public transport and crowded places, strongly suggests <med>Panic Disorder with <med>Agoraphobia</med>. Additionally, your persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of pleasure</sym> in activities, and <sym>depression</sym> indicate a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> may be associated with the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>, or may warrant further evaluation for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> if they persist despite treatment. The <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> may be related to the <med>Panic Disorder</med> or could indicate a co-occurring disorder. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> is noted, but ongoing monitoring is necessary given your feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Psychotherapy: <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) is recommended to address the <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. <med>CBT</med> can help you manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</med>, and also address the <sym>depressive symptoms</med>.\n2. Medication management: Consultation with a psychiatrist for <med>medication</med> management is recommended. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial for both the <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, a short-term course of <med>benzodiazepines</med> may be considered for <sym>panic attack</med> management, but should be used cautiously due to the risk of dependence.\n3. Sleep hygiene education: Addressing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and, if necessary, <med>sleep medication</med> management can improve overall well-being and <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n4. Psychosocial support: Encourage reconnection with social support networks, such as friends and family, to alleviate <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Support groups for individuals with <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Depression</med> may also be beneficial.\n5. Monitoring and follow-up: Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, medication effectiveness, and overall well-being. Adjust treatment plan as needed based on your response to interventions.\n6. Evaluation for co-occurring disorders: If <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> persist, evaluate for co-occurring <med>Personality Disorders</med> or <med>Dissociative Disorders</med>.",
