Today, we're going to use the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to assess a range of mental health domains. This will help us identify any areas of concern and guide our discussion. Please know that this is a confidential space, and your responses are safe with me. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to describe your experiences over the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

    {
      "role": "patient",

    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Yeah, more often than before. I snap at people for no reason, and I get angry quickly. It's like I can't control it sometimes."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's important to acknowledge those feelings. Let's move on. Have you been sleeping less than usual, but still have a lot of energy?"

      "role": "patient",
      "content": "No, not really. Actually, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. It's like my body just wants to shut down."

The patient exhibits significant avoidance behaviors related to anxiety and reports feelings of detachment during panic attacks. Additionally, there is evidence of social withdrawal and occasional passive suicidal ideation. The patient does not report any substance abuse issues. Given the severity of symptoms and the presence of risk factors, a comprehensive treatment plan addressing both depressive and anxiety symptoms is warranted, including a focus on relapse prevention for suicidal ideation.",

The patient does not report <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, making <med>Schizoaffective Disorder</med> less likely. <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> is not indicated as the patient does not report a traumatic event with subsequent intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Referral to a <med>mental health professional</med> for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss treatment options.\n2. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, focusing on <sym>cognitive restructuring</sym> and <sym>exposure therapy</med>.\n3.
