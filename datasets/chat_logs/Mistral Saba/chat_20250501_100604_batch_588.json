These symptoms have been present for a prolonged period, meeting the duration criteria for these disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms. CBT can help manage <sym>racing thoughts</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and improve overall <med>mood</med>.\n\n2. **Medication Review:** Assess the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication to help manage <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep quality</sym> issues through sleep hygiene practices and, if necessary, refer to a sleep specialist for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n4. **Stress Management:** Explore stress management techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, or yoga to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Given the <sym>disconnection</sym> from others and lack of enjoyment in relationships, consider interpersonal therapy to improve social functioning and relationships.\n\n6. **Further Evaluation:** Consider a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to assess <sym>memory problems</sym> and rule out any underlying <med>cognitive impairment</med>.",
