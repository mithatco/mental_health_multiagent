      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling overwhelmed and distressed lately. You've shared that you've been experiencing a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and increased irritability. You've also mentioned difficulties with sleep, intense anxiety, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you've been experiencing unexplained <sym>aches and pains</sym>, feelings of detachment, and a sense of being lost and uncertain about your identity. It's clear that these experiences have been causing you a great deal of distress and have impacted your daily functioning and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** You've reported <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> supports this diagnosis. Furthermore, your description of <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> you've experienced may be associated with, but do not necessarily warrant a diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> could be related to the underlying <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, or may warrant further exploration for other potential <med>trauma-related disorders</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider starting with <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address both <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. <med>CBT</med> can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your distress.\n2. **Medication Management**: Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to help manage your symptoms. A combination of therapy and medication may be most effective.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve your sleep quality. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment.\n4. **Support System**: Encourage reconnection with friends and family. Social support can play a crucial role in your recovery. Consider joining support groups or engaging in activities that you used to enjoy to foster a sense of belonging.\n5. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n6. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It's important to have ongoing support as you work through these challenges.\n\nGiven the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to ensure your safety. If you feel overwhelmed or have thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline immediately. You are not alone, and there are people who care about your well-being and want to help.",
