This assessment will help us better understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to describe how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem. Let's begin with the first question."

You've also been experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, waking up exhausted and restless. Anxiety and panic have become a significant part of your daily life, leading to avoidance behaviors and a sense of detachment from yourself and others. You've mentioned <quote>I feel a bit lost lately. It's like I don't recognize myself, and I'm not sure what I want anymore</quote>. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings are real and valid, and it's commendable that you've reached out for help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym> further support these diagnoses. The patient's <sym>somatic complaints</sym> and <quote>feeling that their illnesses aren't being taken seriously enough</quote> may suggest a co-occurring <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this is not the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. <med>CBT</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</med>, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve overall functioning.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be prescribed to manage <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>. Additionally, <med>benzodiazepines</med> may be prescribed for short-term management of severe <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> to help them understand their symptoms and the importance of treatment adherence.\n5. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and other <sym>suicidal behaviors</sym>, as the presence of <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med> increases the risk. Ensure the patient has a safety plan in place and encourage them to reach out to a mental health professional if they experience worsening symptoms.\n6. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and maintain strong support systems. Interpersonal therapy can also be beneficial in addressing <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improving interpersonal functioning.",

Key symptoms include anhedonia, persistent depressed mood, irritability, insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, somatic complaints, and interpersonal distress. Cognitive symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating and intrusive thoughts, are also present. The patient denies suicidal ideation but exhibits significant risk factors and warning signs that warrant close monitoring and comprehensive treatment. The patient's feelings of being unheard regarding their symptoms may impact treatment adherence and overall well-being. A multimodal approach, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly medication, is recommended to address the patient's complex symptom profile.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling overwhelmed lately. You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you once enjoyed, feeling down and hopeless most of the time. You've also been experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, waking up exhausted and restless. Anxiety and panic have become a significant part of your daily life, leading to avoidance behaviors and a sense of detachment from yourself and others. You've mentioned <quote>I feel a bit lost lately. It's like I don't recognize myself, and I'm not sure what I want anymore</quote>. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings are real and valid, and it's commendable that you've reached out for help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym> further support these diagnoses. The patient's <sym>somatic complaints</sym> and <quote>feeling that their illnesses aren't being taken seriously enough</quote> may suggest a co-occurring <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this is not the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. <med>CBT</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</med>, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve overall functioning.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be prescribed to manage <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>. Additionally, <med>benzodiazepines</med> may be prescribed for short-term management of severe <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> to help them understand their symptoms and the importance of treatment adherence.\n5. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and other <sym>suicidal behaviors</sym>, as the presence of <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med> increases the risk. Ensure the patient has a safety plan in place and encourage them to reach out to a mental health professional if they experience worsening symptoms.\n6. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and maintain strong support systems. Interpersonal therapy can also be beneficial in addressing <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improving interpersonal functioning.",
