      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time lately. Over the past two weeks, you've described feeling a persistent sense of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, with little interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be incredibly exhausting and overwhelming. Additionally, you've mentioned feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and struggling with <sym>identity confusion</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings have led to some <sym>impulsive</sym> behaviors and <sym>avoidance</sym> of certain situations. It's important to acknowledge the strength it took to share these experiences, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> Features, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits, and possible <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<DSM-5> criteria A, B, and C). The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>excessive worry</sym> aligns with <med>Anxiety</med> Features. The patient also exhibits <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (<sym>repetitive checking</sym>), which are indicative of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient describes <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, suggesting possible <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent or plan do not meet criteria for <med>Suicidal Behavior Disorder</med>, but warrant careful monitoring. The patient's <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> and <sym>risky decisions</sym> could also indicate <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed to determine if these behaviors are part of a manic episode.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>OCD</sym> symptoms. <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</med> (<med>DBT</med>) could also be beneficial for managing <sym>impulsivity</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</med>. Additionally, <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) may help address <sym>relationship strain</sym> and <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consultation with a psychiatrist for potential <med>antidepressant</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. If <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> is suspected, mood-stabilizing medications may be considered.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Develop a consistent <med>sleep hygiene</med> routine to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include regular sleep schedules, relaxation techniques, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help them understand their symptoms and the importance of treatment.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to combat <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.\n6. **Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess the patient for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <med>self-harm</med> behaviors, and ensure a safety plan is in place if necessary.\n7. **Substance Use Assessment:** Although the patient denies current <med>substance use</med>, regular assessment is important due to the potential for <med>substance use disorder</med> co-occurring with <med>mental health</med> conditions.",
