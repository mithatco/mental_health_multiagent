You've been experiencing a profound sense of <quote>sadness</quote> and <quote>hopelessness</quote> that has made it difficult to find pleasure in activities you once enjoyed. This <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are accompanied by significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> that has led you to avoid certain situations. Additionally, you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, questioning your identity, and withdrawing from social connections. These <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> add to the overall sense of disconnection and uncertainty you've described. It's also concerning that you've had <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote>, even if they are fleeting. Your physical health seems to be affected as well, with frequent <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> that you attribute to stress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> over the past two weeks indicates a major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. <sym>Dissociative symptoms</sym>, <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> further support the diagnosis. The patient's report of <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> indicates the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a characteristic feature of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> or <sym>substance use</sym> supports the diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> rather than other depressive disorders. The patient's symptoms meet the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> as outlined in the DSM-5.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, their symptoms, and available treatment options.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> is recommended to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. Additionally, <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> can help address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider medication management with a psychiatrist, including <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious symptoms</sym>.\n\n4. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Assess the patient's current risk of suicide, and develop a safety plan if necessary. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> regularly and provide support and resources as needed.\n\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Encourage open communication about <sym>symptoms</sym> and any concerns or challenges the patient may be experiencing.\n\n7. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social supports and engage in activities they enjoy. This can help reduce <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve overall well-being.",
