It seems like you've been avoiding social situations due to fear of judgment, and you've been having some trouble with sleep, which is likely contributing to your overall fatigue. It's clear that you've been grappling with feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your future, which can be quite distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with the criteria for a major depressive episode, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14), and <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q4). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) that are not better accounted for by another <med>mental disorder</med>. The patient also exhibits <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> (Q16) and <sym>identity confusion</sym> (Q19), which are common in <med>depression</med>. The absence of psychotic features (Q12, Q13) and the presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> features support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> <symptoms</sym>. These therapies can help the patient challenge negative thought patterns, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop coping strategies.\n\n2. **Medication:** Evaluate the patient for potential pharmacotherapy options, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>, to manage <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> <symptoms</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and potentially sleep medications if necessary.\n\n4. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and build a support network to combat <sym>social isolation</sym>. This could include group therapy or support groups focused on <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to help the patient understand their <symptoms</sym> and the importance of treatment adherence.\n\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Risk:** Although the patient denies current suicidal ideation, it is crucial to continue monitoring for any changes in <sym>suicidal</sym> thoughts or behaviors, given the <quote>I've been feeling really down</quote> and <quote>I've been feeling really uncertain about my future</quote>.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",

      "predicted": "I hear that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately, with a noticeable decrease in your enjoyment of activities you used to love. You've been experiencing a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness, and you've mentioned feeling more irritable and anxious than usual. It seems like you've been avoiding social situations due to fear of judgment, and you've been having some trouble with sleep, which is likely contributing to your overall fatigue. It's clear that you've been grappling with feelings of detachment and uncertainty about your future, which can be quite distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with the criteria for a major depressive episode, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14), and <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q4). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) that are not better accounted for by another <med>mental disorder</med>. The patient also exhibits <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> (Q16) and <sym>identity confusion</sym> (Q19), which are common in <med>depression</med>. The absence of psychotic features (Q12, Q13) and the presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> features support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> <symptoms</sym>. These therapies can help the patient challenge negative thought patterns, improve interpersonal relationships, and develop coping strategies.\n\n2. **Medication:** Evaluate the patient for potential pharmacotherapy options, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>, to manage <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> <symptoms</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and potentially sleep medications if necessary.\n\n4. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and build a support network to combat <sym>social isolation</sym>. This could include group therapy or support groups focused on <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n5. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to help the patient understand their <symptoms</sym> and the importance of treatment adherence.\n\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Risk:** Although the patient denies current suicidal ideation, it is crucial to continue monitoring for any changes in <sym>suicidal</sym> thoughts or behaviors, given the <quote>I've been feeling really down</quote> and <quote>I've been feeling really uncertain about my future</quote>.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
