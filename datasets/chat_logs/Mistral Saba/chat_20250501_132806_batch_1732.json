Co-occurring symptoms of depression and anxiety are also evident, with mood dysregulation and irritability. Sleep disturbances are significant and may be contributing to overall mental health challenges. The patient's use of alcohol for sleep indicates a potential coping mechanism that warrants monitoring. The patient does not report any psychotic symptoms or severe substance use issues. Further evaluation and intervention are recommended to address these symptoms and improve overall mental health and quality of life.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been through a significant trauma with the accident, and it's understandable that you're experiencing a range of challenging <sym>symptoms</sym> in its aftermath. You've been feeling a sense of loss and lack of enjoyment in activities that you used to love, which is often indicative of <med>depression</med>. You've also mentioned feeling constantly <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, especially in situations that remind you of the accident. This heightened <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> of triggers are common responses to trauma. Additionally, your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> are likely connected to both your <sym>anxiety</sym> and your overall mood. It's also understandable that you feel <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your relationships, as these are common experiences following a traumatic event. Lastly, your use of alcohol to aid sleep is a way to cope, but it's important to monitor this, as it could potentially develop into a <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n***Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (PTSD), <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD), and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (mild)\n\n***Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with multiple <med>diagnoses</med>. The patient's <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of the accident, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, and <sym>panic</sym> responses to accident-related stimuli strongly suggest <med>PTSD</med>. The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> indicate a <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors are consistent with <med>GAD</med>. Additionally, the occasional use of alcohol for sleep indicates a <med>substance use disorder</med>, albeit in its early stages.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n1. **Psychotherapy:**\n   - <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Trauma-Focused CBT</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> <sym>symptoms</sym> and <med>GAD</med>.\n   - <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> or <med>Psychodynamic Therapy</med> to explore and address <med>depression</med>.\n2. **Medication Management:**\n   - Consultation with a <med>psychiatrist</med> for medication evaluation, which may include <med>antidepressants</med> to manage both <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n   - Consideration of <med>sleep aids</med> to manage <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, guided by a healthcare provider.\n3. **Support Groups:**\n   - Referral to <med>support groups</med> for trauma survivors to share experiences and coping strategies.\n4. **Substance Use Evaluation:**\n   - Assessment of alcohol use patterns to monitor progression and prevent escalation into a more severe <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n5. **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n   - Encouragement of regular exercise, a balanced diet, and mindfulness practices to improve overall mental health and <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:**\n   - Scheduled follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
