You've been experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, which has made it difficult to maintain social relationships.

Additionally, the patient's persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>patient mentions: \"Nothing seems to bring me joy anymore\"</quote>) suggest the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, excessive <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (<quote>patient mentions: \"I avoid a lot of things now\"</quote>) are consistent with <med>GAD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a thorough evaluation and to discuss <med>medication management</med> options, including <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) for both <med>OCD</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n2. Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) with a focus on <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (<med>ERP</med>) for the <med>OCD</med> symptoms and <med>cognitive-behavioral strategies</med> for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. Refer the patient to a <med>clinical psychologist</med> or <med>therapist</med> for ongoing <med>psychotherapy</med> to address <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and any underlying <med>trauma</med>.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a <med>healthy lifestyle</med> to support overall mental health.\n5. Monitor the patient's <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and consider <med>sleep hygiene</med> interventions or <med>sleep medication</med> if necessary.\n6. Assess the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure appropriate safety planning and support.

You've been feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>irritable</sym>, and your daily activities no longer bring you pleasure. You've been experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, which has made it difficult to maintain social relationships. You've also mentioned <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> about harming others or leaving things undone, which you find distressing. It's understandable that these experiences are causing you significant distress and impacting your ability to live the life you want.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>) with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>unwanted, intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> that are time-consuming and cause distress aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>OCD</med> (<quote>patient mentions: \"Like, what if I leave the stove on or what if I hurt someone?\"</quote> and <quote>patient mentions: \"I have to check things repeatedly, like making sure the door is locked or washing my hands until they're raw\"</quote>). Additionally, the patient's persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>patient mentions: \"Nothing seems to bring me joy anymore\"</quote>) suggest the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, excessive <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (<quote>patient mentions: \"I avoid a lot of things now\"</quote>) are consistent with <med>GAD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a thorough evaluation and to discuss <med>medication management</med> options, including <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) for both <med>OCD</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n2. Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) with a focus on <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (<med>ERP</med>) for the <med>OCD</med> symptoms and <med>cognitive-behavioral strategies</med> for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. Refer the patient to a <med>clinical psychologist</med> or <med>therapist</med> for ongoing <med>psychotherapy</med> to address <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and any underlying <med>trauma</med>.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a <med>healthy lifestyle</med> to support overall mental health.\n5. Monitor the patient's <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and consider <med>sleep hygiene</med> interventions or <med>sleep medication</med> if necessary.\n6. Assess the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure appropriate safety planning and support. Although the patient denies current <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, it's important to monitor this <sym>symptom</sym> closely.",
