The questions built smoothly on previous responses, demonstrating a clear understanding of the patient's symptoms.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.

You've expressed feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, as well as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideations, as well as <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>. These experiences have led to <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of <sym>identity disturbance</sym>, leaving you feeling disconnected from yourself and others. It's clear that you're dealing with a complex set of challenges, and I'm here to help you navigate them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>psychotic features</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in previously enjoyed activities. These symptoms are accompanied by <sym>psychotic features</sym> such as auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideations, which are not better explained by another <med>mental disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> may be secondary to the underlying <med>depression</med> and <med>psychosis</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>psychotic features</sym>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>. Additionally, consider <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> to explore <sym>identity disturbance</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding <sym>stimulants</sym> close to bedtime.\n4. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure a safety plan is in place. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. **Collaboration with Primary Care Physician:** Coordinate care with the patient's primary care physician to rule out any <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and to ensure comprehensive care.",
