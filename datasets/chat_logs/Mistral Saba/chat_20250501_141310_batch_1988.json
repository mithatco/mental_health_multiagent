This questionnaire will help us understand how you're coping with recent events and identify any areas that might need further attention. Your answers will be kept confidential, and we'll use this information to better understand your experiences. There are 23 questions in total. Let's begin with the first one. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things over the past two weeks?"
