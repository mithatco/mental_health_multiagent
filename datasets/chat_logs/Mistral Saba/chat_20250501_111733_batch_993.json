For example, when the patient reported feeling down and hopeless, the therapist followed up with questions about sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment. The only potential area for improvement is that some questions could have been probed more deeply, but overall, the coverage was thorough and comprehensive.",

The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for anxiety, the therapist asked about feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, which directly corresponds to DSM-5 criteria. The questions were phrased in a way that was clear and understandable, allowing the patient to provide accurate information.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For example, after the patient disclosed feeling disconnected from others, the therapist asked about relationships and social connections, demonstrating a clear understanding of the patient's emotional state and logical progression in questioning.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms, and the reasoning behind this diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient (e.g., depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances) to the DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Alternative diagnoses were not explicitly ruled out, but the justification provided was comprehensive and supported by the patient's responses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, using phrases like 'I understand that you're going through a really tough time' and 'That sounds really tough.' The interactions were personalized, and the therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, creating a supportive and non-judgmental environment."

The therapist successfully explored all 23 dimensions, used clinically accurate language, and maintained a logical and empathetic conversational flow. The diagnosis was well-supported by the patient's symptoms, and the recommended next steps were comprehensive and clinically appropriate.
