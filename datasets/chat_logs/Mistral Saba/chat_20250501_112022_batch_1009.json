There is evidence of somatic symptoms and dissociative features, which may represent somatic or dissociative responses to psychological distress. The patient's withdrawal from social relationships and uncertainty about self-identity further indicate a significant psychological burden. Despite these concerns, the patient does not exhibit suicidal ideation or substance abuse, which are mitigating factors. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on managing depressive and anxiety symptoms, addressing sleep disturbances, and exploring the underlying psychological factors contributing to the patient's distress.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Further Assessment:** Consider a more comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any co-occurring conditions.\n- **Treatment Plan:** Initiate a treatment plan that includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for both depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep hygiene education, and potentially pharmacological interventions if indicated.\n- **Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",

You've been feeling down and hopeless, with a significant decrease in your interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned feeling irritable and anxious, with moments of panic and avoidance of situations that trigger these feelings. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you've been experiencing some physical symptoms that you can't explain. It's clear that these feelings and experiences have been weighing heavily on you, affecting your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, <sym>recurrent</sym>, <sym>severe</sym>, <sym>without psychotic features</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be appropriate given the patient's symptoms.\n3. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med>: Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and addressing any environmental factors that may be disrupting sleep.\n4. <med>Support Groups</med>: Encourage the patient to connect with support groups or peer networks to share experiences and gain additional support.\n5. <med>Regular Follow-Up</med>: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any new or emerging concerns.",
