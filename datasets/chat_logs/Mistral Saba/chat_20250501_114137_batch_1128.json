The patient's history of substance misuse and suicidal ideation, though not currently active, warrant close monitoring. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed mental status exam and a thorough medical workup, is recommended to rule out underlying medical conditions and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

It's clear that you've been dealing with a range of challenging <sym>symptoms</sym> over the past few weeks, including <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>physical discomfort</sym>. It sounds like you've been feeling quite isolated and unsure about your future, which must be quite difficult. It's also important to acknowledge your efforts to manage these feelings, such as starting new projects, even if they sometimes feel risky. Your experiences with <sym>medication</sym> misuse and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> highlight the complexity of your situation. It's commendable that you're seeking help, and I'm here to support you in understanding and managing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your reported <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> align closely with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> you've mentioned further support these diagnoses. While <med>Somatoform Disorder</med> cannot be ruled out, given the <sym>physical symptoms</sym> without clear medical etiology, the primary <sym>emotional distress</sym> and <sym>psychological symptoms</sym> point more strongly to <med>Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough psychiatric assessment to rule out other potential <med>diagnoses</med> and to better understand the interplay between your <sym>emotional</sym>, <sym>cognitive</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Consider referring you to a therapist for <med>CBT</med>, which can help address both <med>Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication Review:** Given your history of <sym>medication misuse</sym>, conduct a careful review of your current <med>medications</med> and consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation and management plan.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help improve your <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n5. **Substance Use Screening:** Regularly screen for <med>substance use disorders</med> to monitor any potential misuse of <med>medications</med> or other substances.\n6. **Social Support:** Encourage you to reconnect with supportive relationships and consider joining a support group to reduce feelings of <sym>isolation</sym>.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
