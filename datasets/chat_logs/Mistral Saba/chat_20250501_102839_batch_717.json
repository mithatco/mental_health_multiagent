      "predicted": "I appreciate your honesty and openness as you've shared your experiences with me today. It's clear that you've been struggling with a range of <sym>symptoms</sym> that are significantly impacting your daily life and well-being. You've mentioned feeling down and disinterested in activities you used to enjoy, especially after social events. You also described feeling anxious, with physical <sym>symptoms</sym> like a racing heart and nausea, and you've been avoiding social situations due to these feelings. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and feelings of detachment. It's understandable that these challenges can feel overwhelming, and I'm here to support you in navigating them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>) with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>SAD</med>) and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>mild</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your report of persistent and excessive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about various situations, accompanied by <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as racing heart and nausea, aligns with the criteria for <med>GAD</med>. Additionally, your avoidance of social situations and the <sym>anxiety</sym> you experience before these events suggest a <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Furthermore, your <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> indicate the presence of a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>mild</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> you've mentioned could be a feature of <med>OCD</med>, but they are more consistent with <med>SAD</med> given their content and context. The absence of <sym>psychosis</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> makes these diagnoses more fitting at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) focused on <med>GAD</med> and <med>SAD</med> to help you manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors.\n\n2. <med>Mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</med>.\n\n3. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve social functioning.\n\n4. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>) to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, if symptoms persist despite <med>therapy</med>.\n\n5. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust <med>treatment</med> as needed.\n\n6. <med>Sleep hygiene</med> education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.",
