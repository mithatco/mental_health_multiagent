Consider discussing this with your healthcare provider.\n5. **Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation:** Although you've denied active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it's crucial to continue monitoring these thoughts. Ensure you have a safety plan in place and know who to reach out to if your thoughts become more urgent.\n6. **Further Evaluation of Dissociative Symptoms:** Given your description of feeling detached, it may be beneficial to explore these <sym>dissociative</med> symptoms further with a mental health professional experienced in <med>trauma-related</med> disorders.",

The therapist maintained a coherent and relevant line of inquiry, adapting to the patient's disclosures and concerns. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, indicating a well-structured and effective assessment process.",
