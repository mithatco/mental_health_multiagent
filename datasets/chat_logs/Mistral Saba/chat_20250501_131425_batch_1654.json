It's understandable that these symptoms are causing you distress and impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with <sym>Anxiety</sym> and <sym>Panic Attacks</sym> Specifiers**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The severity of these symptoms is indicated by their impact on the patient's daily functioning and the <sym>panic attacks</sym> they experience. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further support the inclusion of the <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> specifiers. The patient's somatic symptoms and feelings of depersonalization are consistent with <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Personality Traits</med>, but these are not the primary focus of the diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or a mental health provider for a comprehensive evaluation and ongoing treatment.\n2. Consider pharmacological interventions, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other antidepressants, to manage the <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. Implement evidence-based therapies, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med>, to address the patient's <med>MDD</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>panic attacks</med>.\n4. Monitor the patient's <med>suicidal ideation</med> closely, and ensure they have a safety plan in place. Provide support and resources for crisis intervention if needed.\n5. Address the patient's feelings of not being taken seriously by medical professionals, and work on building a trusting and supportive therapeutic relationship.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in self-care activities and social support to improve their overall well-being and coping skills.",

The therapist directly linked the patient's symptoms to the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxiety and Panic Attacks specifiers. Alternative diagnoses were implicitly considered by the breadth of symptoms explored.",

It's clear that you've been struggling with a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, along with persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness. You've mentioned increased irritability, frequent anxiety and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and a noticeable change in your sleep patterns. Additionally, you've experienced some unexplained physical aches and pains, and feelings of depersonalization and loss of self-identity. It's understandable that these symptoms are causing you distress and impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with <sym>Anxiety</sym> and <sym>Panic Attacks</sym> Specifiers**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> strongly suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The severity of these symptoms is indicated by their impact on the patient's daily functioning and the <sym>panic attacks</sym> they experience. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further support the inclusion of the <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> specifiers. The patient's somatic symptoms and feelings of depersonalization are consistent with <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Personality Traits</med>, but these are not the primary focus of the diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or a mental health provider for a comprehensive evaluation and ongoing treatment.\n2. Consider pharmacological interventions, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other antidepressants, to manage the <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. Implement evidence-based therapies, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med>, to address the patient's <med>MDD</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>panic attacks</med>.\n4. Monitor the patient's <med>suicidal ideation</med> closely, and ensure they have a safety plan in place. Provide support and resources for crisis intervention if needed.\n5. Address the patient's feelings of not being taken seriously by medical professionals, and work on building a trusting and supportive therapeutic relationship.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in self-care activities and social support to improve their overall well-being and coping skills.",
