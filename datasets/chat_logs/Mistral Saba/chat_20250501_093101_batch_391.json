Additionally, alternative diagnoses were not discussed, and the therapist could have considered other potential diagnoses, such as anxiety disorders or trauma-related disorders.",

However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more emotionally attuned to the patient's distress (e.g., when discussing suicidal ideation).
