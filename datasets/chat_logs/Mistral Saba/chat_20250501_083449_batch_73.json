The sleep disturbances and somatic symptoms require further evaluation. The patient's social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors are notable and may be contributing to the maintenance of current symptoms.

It sounds like you've been going through a lot lately, feeling down and hopeless, and struggling with sleep and anxiety, especially around reminders of a past accident. It's clear that these challenges are affecting your daily life and relationships, and it's understandable that you want to get back to normal. It's important to recognize that these feelings and experiences are valid and that you're not alone in facing these difficulties.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> features, <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>, and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient also experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to a past accident, suggesting <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> features. The patient's increased alcohol consumption to manage sleep and other symptoms indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (<med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>).\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a <med>mental health professional</med> for further evaluation and development of a treatment plan.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as <sym>trauma-related</sym> symptoms.\n3. <med>Medication management</med> to consider <med>antidepressants</med>, <med>anxiolytics</med>, and <med>sleep aids</med> as appropriate.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene</med> education and interventions to improve sleep quality.\n5. <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> evaluation and treatment, including <med>alcohol screening</med> and <med>brief intervention</med> or <med>referral to a substance use treatment program</med> if necessary.\n6. <med>Psychological support</med> to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</med>, such as <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>).\n7. <med>Somatoform</med> evaluation to rule out <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or other <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>unexplained aches and pains</med>.\n8. <med>Regular follow-ups</med> to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
