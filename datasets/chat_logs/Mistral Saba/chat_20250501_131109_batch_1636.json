This is a confidential and safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, which will help us understand how you've been feeling and if there are any areas we need to explore further. Let's begin with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

You've described feeling a profound loss of interest and pleasure in activities you once enjoyed, a heavy and empty feeling, and a persistent sense of anxiety and worry. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>physical aches and pains</sym> without clear medical cause. It sounds like you're feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and you've had some thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. It's important to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences, and I'm here to help you navigate through these challenges. ***\n\n**<med>Diagnosis:</med> Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n\n**<med>Reasoning:</med>** You report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for more than two weeks, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, you experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive dysfunction</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as aches and pains, which are common in <med>MDD</med>. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, are also consistent with <med>MDD</med>. While you mentioned <quote>I've had some thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore</quote>, you do not have active suicidal plans, which is important to note. The <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> you described further support the diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. Although you mentioned <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, these symptoms are also commonly associated with <med>MDD</med> and do not necessarily warrant a separate diagnosis. There is no evidence of <med>Schizophrenia</med> or other psychotic disorders, as you did not report <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>.\n\n**<med>Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:</med>**\n\n1. Referral to a <med>Psychiatrist</med> or <med>Primary Care Physician (PCP)</med> for a comprehensive evaluation and to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to your <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive thoughts</sym> and improve <sym>mood</sym> regulation.\n3. <med>Medication Management</med> to consider <med>antidepressant</med> medications, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med> and possible referral to a <med>Sleep Specialist</med> to address <sym>insomnia</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. <med>Supportive Therapy</med> to build coping strategies and improve <sym>social functioning</sym>.\n6. Regular <med>Follow-ups</med> to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure overall <med>mental health</med> and <med>well-being</med>.",
