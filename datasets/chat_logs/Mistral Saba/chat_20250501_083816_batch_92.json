Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported suicidal ideation, the therapist immediately acknowledged the concern and noted it as a significant safety issue. All domains, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and others, were thoroughly examined.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for depression, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' directly mapping onto DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics and adequately following up on concerning disclosures. For example, after the patient mentioned sleep disturbances, the therapist explored its impact on daily functioning, demonstrating a logical and consistent approach.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Provisional Major Depressive Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms, which included persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and suicidal ideation. The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive justification for the diagnosis. The reasoning was sound, and the decision to consider a provisional diagnosis was appropriate given the information gathered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, used a warm and personalized tone, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For instance, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist immediately acknowledged the concern and emphasized the importance of creating a safety plan, showing both empathy and professional concern."

Sleep disturbances, specifically insomnia, have been affecting your quality of life, leaving you feeling constantly <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>sluggish</sym>. Additionally, you've experienced some <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>.

Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n2. Implement a safety plan to address the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and a list of supportive contacts.\n3. Refer the patient to a therapist for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or another evidence-based psychotherapy to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n4.
