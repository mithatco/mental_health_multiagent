Key symptoms include anhedonia, depressive mood, constant worry, avoidance behaviors, and compulsive hand-washing. The patient also reports poor sleep quality and occasional feelings of derealization. These symptoms have a significant impact on the patient's daily functioning and social relationships, necessitating a comprehensive mental health evaluation and intervention. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on addressing the underlying anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as the obsessive-compulsive traits, to improve overall well-being and functioning.",

It must be overwhelming to feel this way, and it's important to recognize that you shouldn't have to struggle alone. You've also mentioned <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> due to <sym>fears of contamination</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that are affecting your overall quality of life. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are causing you distress and interfering with your ability to engage in activities you once enjoyed.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>decreased energy</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>constant worry</sym> and <sym>fear of contamination</sym> are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>repetitive thoughts about germs</sym> and <sym>compulsive hand-washing behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>, as well as <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for the <sym>obsessive-compulsive traits</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns, while ERP can help reduce the <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</med>.\n\n2. **Medication Evaluation**: Given the severity of the <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>, a referral to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant and anxiolytic medications</med> may be beneficial.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, a referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n4. **Social Support**: Encourage engagement with <med>support groups</med> or <med>therapeutic communities</med> to address <sym>social isolation</sym> and build a support network.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure that the patient's <sym>symptoms</sym> are managed effectively.\n\n6. **Psychoeducation**: Provide education about <med>mental health conditions</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and the importance of treatment.",
