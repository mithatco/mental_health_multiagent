Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported feelings of hopelessness and depression, the therapist inquired about the frequency and impact of these feelings. Similarly, the therapist explored the patient's experiences with anxiety, sleep disturbances, and repetitive thoughts/behaviors, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for depression, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' directly mapping onto DSM-5 criteria. The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, and no significant inaccuracies or vague phrasing were observed.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For example, after the patient disclosed feelings of anxiety, the therapist logically followed up with questions about avoidance behaviors and physical symptoms associated with anxiety. The conversation demonstrated no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific patient symptoms to DSM-5 criteria, such as decreased interest in activities and persistent sadness for Major Depressive Disorder, and avoidance of social situations due to anxiety for Social Anxiety Disorder. The justification for each diagnosis was comprehensive and well-supported by the patient's reported symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, using phrases like 'I see' and 'It's understandable,' and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For instance, when the patient expressed feelings of hopelessness, the therapist responded with compassion and did not use overly technical language, creating a safe and supportive environment."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional performance across all criteria. The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, used clinically relevant and accurate language, maintained a logical and coherent conversation flow, provided clear diagnostic justifications, and interacted with consistent empathy and professionalism.
