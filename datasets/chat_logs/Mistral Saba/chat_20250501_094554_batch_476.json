It's clear that you've been facing a lot lately, including feelings of <sym>little interest or pleasure</sym> in things you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, and <sym>worries about the future</sym>. You've also been experiencing <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be incredibly challenging. It's understandable that you might feel <sym>disconnected from others</sym> and <sym>avoid social situations</sym> due to these feelings. It's also important to acknowledge the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> you've been having, as these are serious and need to be addressed promptly.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reported <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic episodes</sym> indicate an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, such as feeling detached from oneself and the environment, further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are a significant concern and warrant immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a Psychiatrist:** Given the complexity of the symptoms and the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a referral to a psychiatrist for a more thorough evaluation and potential <med>medication management</med> is recommended.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** <med>CBT</med> can help address both the <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, as well as the <sym>rumination</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>. A therapist trained in <med>CBT</med> can provide strategies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>depressive thoughts</sym>.\n3. **Safety Planning:** Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. This includes identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support contacts.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include techniques such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bed.\n5. **Gradual Exposure:** To address the <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, a gradual exposure approach can be implemented to help the patient re-engage with social activities.\n6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Teach mindfulness and relaxation techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
