This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and any challenges you might be facing. Your responses will be kept confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share openly. We'll go through 23 questions and I'll start with the first one. Let's begin. 1. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

There is evidence of avoidance behaviors and increased substance use, which may be serving as coping mechanisms. The presence of suicidal ideation and misuse of painkillers highlights the need for immediate clinical intervention and ongoing monitoring. Further evaluation is warranted to rule out other potential diagnoses and to develop a comprehensive treatment plan.",
