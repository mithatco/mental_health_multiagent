You've mentioned feeling down and lacking interest in things you used to enjoy, which has been accompanied by increased irritability and anxiety. You've also been struggling with sleep, feeling detached from yourself and others, and experiencing some physical discomfort. It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's misuse of <quote>painkillers a bit more than prescribed</quote> and <quote>a few more than that on occasion</quote> alcohol consumption indicate a potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Begin with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist for potential pharmacotherapy to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Assess the patient's <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> and provide appropriate interventions, such as motivational interviewing or referral to a substance abuse treatment program.\n5. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider support groups or group therapy to address <sym>interpersonal distancing</sym>.\n6. **Psychological Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive psychological evaluation to rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med> and to develop a tailored treatment plan.",
