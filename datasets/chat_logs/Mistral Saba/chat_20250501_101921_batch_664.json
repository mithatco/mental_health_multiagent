It's also clear that you've been feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. It seems like you've been going through a very challenging time, and it's important to address these feelings to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> such as memory issues. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although without specific plans, further support the impression of a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n3. **Medication Evaluation**: Consultation with a psychiatrist to evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve overall mood and energy levels.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n\n5. **Support System**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, as social support is crucial for mental health. Consider involving a <med>support group</med> or <med>family therapy</med> if appropriate.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been struggling quite a bit lately. You've mentioned feeling a persistent sense of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, finding it hard to enjoy things you used to love, and experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. It's also clear that you've been feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. It seems like you've been going through a very challenging time, and it's important to address these feelings to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> such as memory issues. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although without specific plans, further support the impression of a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's overall demeanor suggests a significant level of <sym>distress</sym> and a loss of sense of self, which may contribute to the avoidance behaviors and physical symptoms. While <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorders</med> are also considerations, the prominence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and the impact on daily functioning make <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment**: Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, a thorough safety assessment is necessary to determine the level of risk and implement appropriate safety measures.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy**: Consider starting with <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n3. **Medication Evaluation**: Consultation with a psychiatrist to evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve overall mood and energy levels.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n\n5. **Support System**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, as social support is crucial for mental health. Consider involving a <med>support group</med> or <med>family therapy</med> if appropriate.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
