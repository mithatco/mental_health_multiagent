This can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication if therapy alone is not sufficient.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends and family for support. Consider involving significant others in therapy if the patient is comfortable with this.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommend regular exercise, a healthy diet, and mindfulness practices to support overall <med>mental health</med>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time right now. You've been feeling down and losing interest in the things you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing increased anxiety, interrupted sleep, and some physical discomfort. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are affecting your life and relationships, and it's understandable that you might feel overwhelmed and disconnected from others. It's important to recognize that these feelings are real and deserve attention. You're not alone in this, and there are steps we can take to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> for more than half the days in the past two weeks. These <symptoms</sym> are indicative of a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>, which meets the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient reports significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>worrying</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which suggests a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of <med>Psychotic Features</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> supports the diagnosis and rules out other potential conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>. This can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication if therapy alone is not sufficient.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends and family for support. Consider involving significant others in therapy if the patient is comfortable with this.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommend regular exercise, a healthy diet, and mindfulness practices to support overall <med>mental health</med>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
