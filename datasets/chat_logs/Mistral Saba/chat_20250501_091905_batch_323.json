The periods of depression have left you feeling hopeless and disconnected from those around you, while the manic phases have brought with them impulsivity and risky behaviors. It's understandable that these fluctuations in mood can be exhausting and challenging to manage.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, Type I, Severe, With Psychotic Features\n\n**Reasoning:** Your <sym>mood swings</sym>, characterized by alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym>, are indicative of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. During your depressive episodes, you experience a lack of interest or pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal, which align with the criteria for a major depressive episode. During your manic episodes, you exhibit increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which are consistent with a manic episode. The fact that you are experiencing psychotic features, such as feeling like you can hear what others are thinking, during your manic episodes suggests a severe presentation of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> with psychotic features. Additionally, your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mood disorders</med> or comorbidities.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider pharmacological interventions, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or antidepressants, to help manage your <sym>mood swings</sym> and reduce the risk of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Work closely with a psychiatrist to find the most effective medication regimen.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help you develop coping strategies, manage stress, and improve your overall well-being.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through better sleep hygiene practices and, if necessary, consult a sleep specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n5. **Risk Management:** Develop a safety plan to manage suicidal ideation and impulsive behaviors, and ensure you have a support system in place during high-risk periods.\n6. **Educational Support:** Provide education about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help you and your loved ones understand the condition better and identify triggers and warning signs of <sym>mood episodes</sym>.\n7. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor your symptoms and maintain follow-up appointments with your mental health provider to adjust treatment as needed and ensure your safety.",

During depressive episodes, the patient experiences decreased interest or pleasure, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. During manic episodes, the patient exhibits increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors. The patient\u2019s sleep patterns are highly variable, with insomnia during manic episodes and hypersomnia during depressive episodes. The patient denies psychotic symptoms but reports fleeting thoughts of self-harm, which requires ongoing assessment. The patient\u2019s impulsive behaviors during manic episodes and social withdrawal during depressive episodes are clinically significant and warrant further evaluation and intervention. The patient\u2019s overall presentation suggests a strong indication for a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess for Bipolar Disorder and associated comorbidities.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing significant mood swings that have been causing you a great deal of distress. The periods of depression have left you feeling hopeless and disconnected from those around you, while the manic phases have brought with them impulsivity and risky behaviors. It's understandable that these fluctuations in mood can be exhausting and challenging to manage.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, Type I, Severe, With Psychotic Features\n\n**Reasoning:** Your <sym>mood swings</sym>, characterized by alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym>, are indicative of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. During your depressive episodes, you experience a lack of interest or pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal, which align with the criteria for a major depressive episode. During your manic episodes, you exhibit increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which are consistent with a manic episode. The fact that you are experiencing psychotic features, such as feeling like you can hear what others are thinking, during your manic episodes suggests a severe presentation of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> with psychotic features. Additionally, your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mood disorders</med> or comorbidities.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider pharmacological interventions, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or antidepressants, to help manage your <sym>mood swings</sym> and reduce the risk of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Work closely with a psychiatrist to find the most effective medication regimen.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help you develop coping strategies, manage stress, and improve your overall well-being.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through better sleep hygiene practices and, if necessary, consult a sleep specialist for further evaluation and treatment.\n5. **Risk Management:** Develop a safety plan to manage suicidal ideation and impulsive behaviors, and ensure you have a support system in place during high-risk periods.\n6. **Educational Support:** Provide education about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help you and your loved ones understand the condition better and identify triggers and warning signs of <sym>mood episodes</sym>.\n7. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Regularly monitor your symptoms and maintain follow-up appointments with your mental health provider to adjust treatment as needed and ensure your safety.",
