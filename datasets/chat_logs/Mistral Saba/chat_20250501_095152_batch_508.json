It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, feeling down and disconnected from the things you used to enjoy. You've described a persistent sense of sadness and irritability, as well as difficulty sleeping and feeling anxious most of the time. It's also been tough for you to maintain close relationships, and you've been avoiding certain situations that cause you stress. Recognizing these struggles is an important first step towards feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports experiencing <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym> nearly every day, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> (<quote>It's like a dark cloud hanging over me</quote>, <quote>I snap at people more easily now</quote>), which are key <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med>. The constant feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (<quote>I stay away from places or people that stress me out</quote>) suggest a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's occasional alcohol use for relaxation (<quote>Sometimes, but not every day</quote>) and misuse of prescription painkillers (<quote>I have taken more painkillers than prescribed</quote>) warrant consideration of a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, focusing on <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> and <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>.\n2. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to explore and improve the patient's relationships and social connections.\n3. <med>Medication Management</med> to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. <med>Psychoeducation</med> on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <med>circadian rhythm</med> regulation.\n5. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>substance use</sym> and provide support to prevent <med>substance misuse</med> and potential <med>dependence</med>.\n6.
