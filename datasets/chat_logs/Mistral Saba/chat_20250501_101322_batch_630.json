This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask you to rate how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem. Let's start with the first question: Have you been feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time. You've been feeling persistently down and hopeless, with a heavy cloud hanging over you, making it difficult to find joy in things you used to enjoy. You've described feeling irritable and on edge, with increased sleep but still feeling exhausted. Your anxiety and panic attacks have led you to avoid certain situations, and you've been experiencing unexplained physical symptoms that add to your distress. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are causing significant disruption in your daily life and relationships. You've also mentioned feeling detached and unsure about your identity and purpose, which adds another layer of complexity to your emotional state. You've described a pervasive sense of sadness and hopelessness, coupled with a lack of interest in daily activities.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> that have been persistent over the past two weeks, along with feelings of hopelessness and increased sleep, which are consistent with <med>MDD</med>. The patient's report of increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> fits the criteria for <med>GAD</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>, respectively. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to anxiety and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> further support these diagnoses. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>interpersonal distancing</sym> are also notable and may be associated with these disorders. The patient's symptoms are pervasive and impact their daily functioning and relationships, warranting a clinical diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Review:** Evaluate the patient's current medications and consider adjusting or adding <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anxiolytics</med> as appropriate.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>panic disorder</med>. Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to target <sym>interpersonal distancing</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n3. **Medication Management:** Collaborate with a psychiatrist or primary care physician to monitor medication effectiveness and side effects.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with educational resources about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>panic disorder</med> to help them understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and treatments.\n5. **Lifestyle Recommendations:** Encourage regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep hygiene to support overall well-being and <sym>mood</sym> regulation.\n6. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to build a strong support system.\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
