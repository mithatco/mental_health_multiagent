Your responses will be kept confidential, and the goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you to share your experiences. We'll be going through 23 questions. I'll read each question to you, and you can respond with how much or often you've been bothered by each problem. Let's start with the first question."

It's clear that you've been struggling with various <sym>emotional and psychological challenges</sym> over the past two weeks.

You've also experienced <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> before social events, which has resulted in avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you've had <sym>trouble sleeping</sym> due to worry. It's understandable that these <symptoms> can make you feel disconnected from yourself and others, leaving you unsure about your identity and fit within social contexts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depression</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of <sym>avoidance</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, which is characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. You've expressed <sym>fear of embarrassment</sym> and excessive worry about what others think, and you've reported <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> in crowded places. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, along with your <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> due to worry, suggest a depressive component.

Consider starting <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>cognitive distortions</sym>. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns related to social situations.\n3.

Medications such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be helpful.\n4.

Engage in activities that you used to enjoy or bring you a sense of accomplishment to help counter your <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>.\n7.

      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness and honesty in sharing your experiences with me today. It's clear that you've been struggling with various <sym>emotional and psychological challenges</sym> over the past two weeks. You've mentioned feeling down and hopeless at times, particularly in social situations, which has led to a reduced interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also experienced <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> before social events, which has resulted in avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you've had <sym>trouble sleeping</sym> due to worry. It's understandable that these <symptoms> can make you feel disconnected from yourself and others, leaving you unsure about your identity and fit within social contexts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depression</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of <sym>avoidance</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, which is characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. You've expressed <sym>fear of embarrassment</sym> and excessive worry about what others think, and you've reported <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> in crowded places. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, along with your <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> due to worry, suggest a depressive component. These symptoms have significantly impacted your daily functioning and quality of life. While your symptoms are consistent with <med>Depression</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, they do not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed to better understand the severity and duration of your <symptoms>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a mental health professional for a comprehensive psychological assessment to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n2. Consider starting <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>cognitive distortions</sym>. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns related to social situations.\n3. Explore the possibility of <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with a psychiatrist to manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. Medications such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be helpful.\n4. Practice <med>mindfulness and relaxation techniques</med> to manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve your <sym>sleep quality</sym>. These techniques can help you stay present and reduce worry.\n5. Gradually expose yourself to <sym>social situations</sym> that you've been avoiding, starting with smaller, less intimidating scenarios. This can help you build tolerance and confidence in social settings.\n6. Engage in activities that you used to enjoy or bring you a sense of accomplishment to help counter your <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>.\n7. Maintain open communication with your mental health professional about your <symptoms> and any challenges you face during treatment. This will help ensure that your treatment plan remains effective and tailored to your needs.",
