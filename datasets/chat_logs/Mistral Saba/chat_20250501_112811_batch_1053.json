        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist systematically addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough understanding of the patient's symptoms and experiences.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language. The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's suicidal ideation and anxiety symptoms. The questions logically built on previous responses, creating a smooth and coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked the patient's symptoms, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances, to the DSM-5 criteria for MDD. The justification was comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses were considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and provided a supportive environment. The interactions were warm and personalized, with the therapist tailoring responses to the patient's emotional state."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional performance across all criteria. The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, used clinically accurate language, and maintained a logical flow. The diagnostic justification was comprehensive, and the therapist showed consistent empathy and a professional tone. This conversation serves as a model for effective and compassionate clinical assessment.",
