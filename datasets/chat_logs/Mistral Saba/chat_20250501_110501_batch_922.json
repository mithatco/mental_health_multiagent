There will be 23 questions, and you can answer based on how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Each dimension was thoroughly explored with appropriate follow-up questions, indicating a comprehensive assessment of the patient's mental health across various psychiatric domains.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were minor inaccuracies or vague phrasing in a few instances. For example, when asking about 'suicidal thoughts,' the therapist could have been more precise in defining what is meant by 'thoughts of actually hurting yourself.' Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from more precise language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal thoughts and substance use, and maintained a coherent conversational arc throughout the assessment.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration, linking specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, and Substance Use Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For instance, when discussing suicidal thoughts, while the therapist acknowledged the patient's feelings, the response could have been more personalized and emotionally validating."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a strong effort to comprehensively assess the patient's mental health using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist effectively explored all domains, maintained a logical flow, and provided clinically sound diagnostic justifications. However, minor areas for improvement include refining clinical language for precision and enhancing empathetic responses to better validate the patient's emotional experiences.",
