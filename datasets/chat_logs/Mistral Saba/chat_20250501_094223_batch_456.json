      "predicted": "I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>disconnection</sym> from your usual sense of self and relationships. You've expressed feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>irritable</sym>, and it's clear that these feelings have been impacting your daily life, your relationships, and your ability to find pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. It's also concerning to hear that you've had thoughts of hurting yourself, even if you haven't acted on them. It's important to remember that these feelings and thoughts are not your fault, and it's crucial to get the support you need.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> indicative of a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Additionally, the patient experiences frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, along with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</med>, which suggest a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is a serious concern that warrants immediate attention. The patient's <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> may be related to the severity of their <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is essential to assess their current level of risk and develop a safety plan. This may involve removing access to means of self-harm, developing a plan for when <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> arise, and ensuring the patient has a support system in place.\n\n2. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) is recommended to help the patient manage their <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) may also be beneficial, as the patient has expressed feelings of disconnection from others. <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</med> (<med>DBT</med>) may help with <sym>emotion regulation</sym> and <sym>mood</sym> instability.\n\n3. **Medication Management:** Consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. It is important to monitor for any potential side effects and adjust medication as needed.\n\n4. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation is recommended to rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med> and to provide a more detailed assessment of the patient's symptoms.\n\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to combat feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym>. <med>Supportive therapy</med> can also be beneficial in helping the patient navigate their relationships and personal sense of identity.\n\n6. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> and, if necessary, medication or therapy focused on improving sleep.\n\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This will help ensure the patient's safety and facilitate recovery.\n\n8. **Education:** Provide the patient with information about <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.",
