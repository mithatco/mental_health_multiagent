The patient experiences avoidance behaviors, sleep disturbances, and interpersonal difficulties. The patient's increased irritability and occasional dissociative symptoms are also areas of concern. The overall clinical picture suggests a complex interplay of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with significant avoidance behaviors and interpersonal challenges. Further diagnostic clarification and intervention focused on these areas would be beneficial.",
