Key symptoms include:\n\n1. **Persistent Depressive Symptoms:**\n   - Anhedonia: Loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities.\n   - Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability.\n   - Sleep disturbances, including hypersomnia and difficulty falling back asleep.\n   - Psychomotor retardation: Difficulty initiating and completing tasks.\n   - Generalized anxiety: Concerns escalating to panic attacks.\n   - Obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n\n2. **Anxiety Symptoms:**\n   - Persistent worry and nervousness.\n   - Panic attacks characterized by feelings of panic, difficulty breathing, and racing heart.\n   - Avoidance behaviors related to anxiety.\n   - Hyposomatic symptoms: Unexplained aches and pains.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\n- The patient's responses indicate a pervasive and persistent mood disturbance.\n- Symptoms are frequent and ongoing, impacting daily functioning and relationships.\n- Physical symptoms, such as pain and sleep disturbances, co-occur with psychological symptoms, suggesting a potential psychosomatic component.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n1. **Depressive Disorder:** The patient's symptoms align with a major depressive episode, including anhedonia, persistent sadness, and psychomotor retardation.\n2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** Persistent worry and anxiety, along with panic attacks, suggest an anxiety disorder.\n3. **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors indicates potential OCD.\n4. **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Unexplained physical symptoms that are disproportionate to any underlying medical condition.\n5. **Possible Depersonalization/Derealization:** Occasional feelings of detachment from oneself or surroundings.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Although the patient reports no current suicidal ideation, the presence of persistent depressive symptoms and anxiety warrants close monitoring.\n- Avoidance behaviors and relationship difficulties may exacerbate feelings of isolation and distress.\n- The patient's lack of substance use may be a protective factor, but the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms increases the risk of functional impairment.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex symptomatology characterized by depressive and anxiety symptoms, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and somatic complaints. The symptoms are frequent and impactful, affecting the patient's daily functioning and relationships. A thorough clinical evaluation is warranted to confirm diagnoses and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Further assessment of the patient's coping mechanisms, social support, and any past or current trauma is recommended to inform treatment decisions.",

It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and relationships, and I appreciate your courage in sharing these experiences with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in usual activities</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, <sym>persistent worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>.
