The patient's sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and feelings of derealization and derepersonification add to the clinical picture, indicating a multifaceted mental health challenge. The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance use is notable but does not mitigate the severity of the depression and anxiety. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of disconnection highlight the need for targeted interventions to address both the emotional and relational aspects of their distress. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on evidence-based therapies for depression and anxiety, with an emphasis on cognitive-behavioral strategies and interpersonal support.",
