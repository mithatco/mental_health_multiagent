There is a significant component of anhedonia, depressed mood, and sleep disturbances. The patient reports avoidance behaviors and feelings of social disconnection, which may be indicative of PTSD or severe depression. Somatic symptoms and identity confusion further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's occasional use of alcohol to aid sleep may indicate a developing substance use issue. Continued monitoring for suicidal ideation and escalation of alcohol use is essential. A comprehensive treatment plan should address depression, anxiety, and potential PTSD, with consideration for somatic symptoms and identity issues.",
