The patient reports significant symptoms of anhedonia, depressed mood, anxiety, and panic, which are exacerbated by social situations and stress. There are notable cognitive and interpersonal difficulties, including memory problems, feelings of detachment, and interpersonal distancing. The patient's sleep disturbances and physical symptoms also warrant clinical attention. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on addressing depressive and anxiety symptoms, improving interpersonal connections, and addressing any underlying cognitive issues.",
