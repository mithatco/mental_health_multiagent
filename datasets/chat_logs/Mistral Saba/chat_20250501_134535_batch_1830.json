The patient's avoidance behaviors and withdrawal from social connections may further exacerbate depressive symptoms. The presence of unexplained physical symptoms requires further medical evaluation to rule out organic causes. The patient denies current suicidal ideation but reports feelings of hopelessness, necessitating ongoing assessment and monitoring. The patient's sleep disturbances are also clinically significant, as chronic insomnia can worsen mood and anxiety symptoms. Overall, the patient's symptoms indicate a need for comprehensive psychiatric and psychological evaluation and treatment.",

Questions were phrased in a clinically relevant way, and the therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning.",
