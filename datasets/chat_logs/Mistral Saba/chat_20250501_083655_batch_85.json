The presence of hallucinations and thought broadcasting, along with depressive symptoms, suggests a possible diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features. Anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks and avoidance behaviors, are also clinically significant. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and feelings of detachment and disconnection further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's non-adherence to medication and occasional suicidal ideation warrant immediate attention and intervention. Further evaluation and a comprehensive treatment plan are essential to address these complex and interconnected symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It's clear from your responses that you've been feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from life and the people around you. You've expressed a persistent <sym>sense of hopelessness and loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>frequent anxiety and panic attacks</sym> that make it challenging to function in daily life. The auditory hallucinations you experience, along with a feeling that others can hear your thoughts, have likely increased your sense of isolation and confusion. It's understandable that these feelings would lead to a sense of disconnection from yourself and others, as well as difficulties with memory and concentration. It's also concerning to hear that you've had thoughts of harming yourself, even if you don't have a specific plan right now. It's important to take these feelings seriously and work together to find ways to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Severe\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in daily activities for over two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>, strongly suggest a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thoughts</sym>, such as <quote>someone could hear your thoughts</quote>, indicate <med>psychotic features</med>. The severity of the <sym>symptoms</sym> is evidenced by the significant impairment in functioning and the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, warranting a diagnosis of <med>severe depression</med>. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for <med>major depressive disorder with psychotic features</med> are met.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess <sym>suicidal risk</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med> or <med>serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)</med>, and <med>antipsychotic</med> medication to manage <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Regularly review and adjust the medication regimen as needed.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Incorporate <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> to explore <sym>underlying issues</sym> contributing to <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</med>.\n4. **Substance Use Screening:** Continue to monitor <sym>substance use</sym> and encourage adherence to prescribed medications. Address <sym>non-adherence</sym> through education and support.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n6. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage the patient to connect with supportive friends, family, or support groups to combat <sym>feelings of loneliness</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym>. Involve family members in <med>psychoeducation</med> to better understand and support the patient.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom progression</sym>, assess <med>treatment response</med>, and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.\n8. **Safety Planning:** Develop a collaborative <med>safety plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.",
