There is a clear pattern of emotional dysregulation, cognitive intrusions, and behavioral compulsions. The patient's sleep disturbances and somatic symptoms further complicate the clinical picture. Given the presence of depressive symptoms and avoidance behaviors, ongoing monitoring for suicidal ideation is essential. The patient's reports suggest a need for a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses both the emotional and cognitive aspects of their condition, potentially involving psychotherapy, medication, and supportive interventions.",
