Additionally, the patient's experiences of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, including <sym>fear of dying</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym>, point to features of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> may be related to the anxiety and depression but do not warrant a separate diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both depression and anxiety. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym>, challenge <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and improve overall mental well-being.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible medication management. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) may be beneficial for both depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n\n4. **Support Groups:** Recommend joining support groups for individuals with depression and anxiety. Connecting with others who share similar experiences can provide emotional support and practical coping strategies.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to communicate openly about any changes in symptoms or concerns.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time. You've described feeling <sym>down and hopeless</sym> almost every day, with <sym>anhedonia</sym> setting in as you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy. The <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> you're experiencing add to your struggle, and it's understandable that you're feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>avoidant</sym> of situations that trigger your <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's also clear that you're feeling <sym>misunderstood</sym> and <sym>isolated</sym>, which can make these challenges even harder to face. Your honesty about these experiences is brave, and it's important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with features of <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistently depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for more than half the days in the past two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, strongly suggests a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's experiences of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, including <sym>fear of dying</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym>, point to features of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> may be related to the anxiety and depression but do not warrant a separate diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both depression and anxiety. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym>, challenge <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and improve overall mental well-being.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible medication management. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) may be beneficial for both depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n\n4. **Support Groups:** Recommend joining support groups for individuals with depression and anxiety. Connecting with others who share similar experiences can provide emotional support and practical coping strategies.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to communicate openly about any changes in symptoms or concerns.",
