      "predicted": "Your experiences over the past two weeks have been challenging. You've been feeling down and losing interest in things you used to enjoy, which has been accompanied by <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially around the fear of having <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's clear that you've been dealing with a lot, and it's important to acknowledge the difficulty of these feelings. You've also expressed feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, which can be a frightening experience. Additionally, you've been sleeping more than usual, which could be a way your body is coping with the stress and anxiety. It's commendable that you've been seeking help and completing this assessment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>excessive sleep</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of unexpected <sym>panic attacks</sym>, persistent fear of having another attack, and avoidance behaviors indicate <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's descriptions of feeling detached from themselves and their surroundings are consistent with <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>. The patient denies <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym>, or <sym>misuse of medications</sym>, which helps narrow down the differential diagnosis. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is mentioned, the patient's <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> are not highly distressing and may be related to <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management**: Review current medications and consider adding or adjusting prescriptions for <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> if necessary.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through non-pharmacological interventions, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Psychoeducation**: Educate the patient on <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med> to help them understand and manage their <sym>depersonalization</sym> experiences.\n5. **Support System**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support systems, such as friends and family, to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, despite the patient's current denial of these symptoms.",
