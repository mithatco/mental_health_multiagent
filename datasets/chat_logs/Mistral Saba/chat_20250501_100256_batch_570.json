Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- **Depression:** The patient reports feelings of hopelessness, sadness, and lack of interest or pleasure in activities they used to enjoy.\n- **Anxiety:** The patient experiences periods of feeling anxious, nervous, and on edge, occasionally accompanied by panic attacks.\n- **Sleep disturbances:** The patient experiences both insomnia (sleeping 3-4 hours per night but feeling energized) and hypersomnia (sleeplessness with no associated energy).\n- **Mood swings:** The patient reports fluctuations in mood, including irritability and heightened energy levels during periods of feeling \"high.\"\n- **Avoidance behaviors:** The patient avoids situations that trigger anxiety and has felt distant from others, affecting social interactions.\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- **Mood lability:** There is a clear pattern of mood swings, with periods of heightened energy and lows marked by depression and anxiety.\n- **Impulsivity:** The patient engages in impulsive behaviors, such as starting multiple projects and making impulsive purchases.\n- **Sleep pattern irregularities:** The patient's sleep patterns are inconsistent, with both insomnia and hypersomnia noted.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Bipolar Disorder:** The combination of depressive episodes, periods of elevated mood with increased energy, and impulsive behaviors suggests a potential bipolar disorder.\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's experiences of anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies current substance use, it is important to monitor for any potential substance use as a coping mechanism.\n- **Impulsivity:** The patient's impulsive behaviors, such as starting multiple projects and making financial decisions without thorough consideration, are clinically significant.\n- **Social withdrawal:** The patient's feelings of detachment and decreased enjoyment in social interactions suggest a need for further exploration of interpersonal relationships and social functioning.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal ideation:** Although the patient denies suicidal thoughts, the presence of depressive symptoms and feelings of hopelessness warrants ongoing assessment.\n- **Substance use:** While the patient denies current substance use, the history of mood instability and impulsivity increases the risk for substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\n**5. Summary:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms consistent with a mood disorder, likely bipolar disorder with depressive and hypomanic features, and an anxiety disorder characterized by episodic anxiety and panic attacks. The patient's sleep disturbances, impulsive behaviors, and social withdrawal are clinically significant and warrant further exploration. The absence of active suicidal ideation is reassuring, but the presence of depressive symptoms and feelings of hopelessness necessitate ongoing monitoring for suicidality. The patient's denial of substance use should be followed up, given the risk factors associated with mood disorders and impulsivity. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on managing mood stability, addressing anxiety symptoms, and promoting healthy coping mechanisms and social functioning.",
