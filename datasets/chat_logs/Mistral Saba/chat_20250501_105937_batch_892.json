This assessment will help us understand how you're feeling and identify any areas that might need further exploration. Your responses will be kept confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. This measure consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask each one in a specific order.

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - **Depression:** Persistent feelings of hopelessness, lack of pleasure, and excessive sleep.\n   - **Manic Symptoms:** Increased irritability, reduced need for sleep, engagement in risky behaviors, and grandiosity.\n   - **Anxiety:** Recurring anxiety and panic episodes, avoidance behaviors during depressive episodes.\n   - **Sleep Disturbances:** Insomnia during manic episodes and hypersomnia during depressive episodes.\n   - **Identity and Relationship Issues:** Feelings of detachment and uncertainty about personal identity and life goals, social withdrawal during depressive episodes.\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n   - **Periodic Mood Swings:** The patient reports alternating between depressive and manic episodes, indicating a possible bipolar disorder.\n   - **Sleep Disruption:** Sleep patterns are disrupted during both manic and depressive episodes.\n   - **Avoidance and Withdrawal:** Increased anxiety and avoidance behaviors during depressive episodes.\n   - **No Psychotic Symptoms:** No reported hallucinations, delusions, or thought insertion/withdrawal.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Mood Regulation:** The patient's fluctuating mood states suggest a need for a comprehensive mood stabilization plan.\n   - **Risk Assessment:** Although the patient reports no suicidal ideation, the presence of thoughts of death and severe depressive episodes warrants ongoing risk monitoring.\n   - **Substance Use:** Although minimal, any alcohol use should be monitored closely, especially given the mood disorder.\n   - **Social Isolation:** Withdrawal and difficulty connecting with others during depressive episodes could exacerbate symptoms.\n   - **Medication Management:** Past issues with antidepressants indicate the need for careful medication management and monitoring.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Although not currently experiencing suicidal thoughts, past thoughts of death and severe depressive episodes warrant ongoing monitoring.\n   - **Manic Symptoms:** Engaging in risky behaviors and hyperactivity during manic episodes could lead to further complications.\n   - **Medication Non-Adherence:** Any perceived adverse effects from medication could lead to discontinuation.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a pattern of mood swings characterized by depressive and manic episodes. Depressive symptoms include persistent feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, excessive sleep, and social withdrawal. Manic symptoms include increased irritability, reduced sleep need, risky behaviors, and grandiosity. The patient also experiences anxiety and panic during depressive episodes and avoids social situations accordingly. Sleep disturbances are common during both manic and depressive episodes. No psychotic symptoms are reported, but the presence of mood swings and anxiety suggests a possible diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. The patient's history of medication issues and social withdrawal highlight the need for careful management and ongoing support. Regular follow-ups and risk assessments are recommended to monitor mood stability and prevent potential crises.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been experiencing significant fluctuations in your mood, with periods of intense sadness and hopelessness interspersed with periods of heightened energy and impulsivity. Your description of feeling <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> during depressive episodes, coupled with <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>hypersomnia</sym> during different phases, suggests a cyclical pattern that could be indicative of a mood disorder. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, as well as the challenges you face in social relationships and sense of self, add layers of complexity to your situation. It's clear that these episodes are not only affecting your emotional well-being but also impacting your daily functioning and quality of life.\n\n**<quote>Diagnosis:</quote> Bipolar II Disorder**\n\n**<quote>Reasoning:</quote>** The patient's report of alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> aligns closely with the criteria for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. The <sym>depressive episodes</sym> are characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, while the <sym>hypomanic/manic episodes</sym> are marked by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>engagement in risky behaviors</sym>. The patient's history of <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further supports this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and the presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> during depressive episodes are consistent with the typical presentation of <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>.
