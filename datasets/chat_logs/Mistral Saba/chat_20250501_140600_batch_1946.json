      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been having a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling down and losing interest in things you used to enjoy, struggling with sleep, and experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life and your relationships. You've also expressed feeling detached from yourself and others, and you've had some troubling thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings are valid and that you deserve support during this challenging time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a constellation of <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a major depressive disorder, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The patient reports passive suicidal ideation, which is a significant concern. The <sym>symptoms</sym> have been present for at least two weeks, and they are causing significant impairment in the patient's daily functioning. The patient denies <sym>psychotic features</sym> and <sym>substance abuse</sym>, which helps to differentiate this from other conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a mental health professional:** Given the severity of the <sym>symptoms</sym> and the presence of passive suicidal ideation, a referral to a psychiatrist or therapist is essential. A thorough assessment and treatment plan should be developed to address the <sym>major depressive disorder</sym>.\n2. **Pharmacological intervention:** Consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <sym>major depressive disorder</sym>.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> can be beneficial in helping the patient address negative thought patterns and improve interpersonal relationships.\n4. **Sleep hygiene education:** Provide guidance on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include strategies such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. **Monitoring of suicidal ideation:** Given the patient's report of passive suicidal ideation, regular follow-ups are crucial to monitor <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and ensure safety.",
