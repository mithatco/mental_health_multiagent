This questionnaire will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Your answers will be kept confidential, and the goal is to evaluate any symptoms that might need further attention. We'll cover 23 questions, and I'll ask you each one at a time. Let's begin with the first question."

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Well, it's been really hard to find enjoyment in things I used to like. I feel like my mind is always racing with worries. Even when I try to do something fun, I end up worrying about something else. It's like I can't just relax and enjoy the moment."

      "content": "Got it. Do you have unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images that repeatedly enter your mind?"
    },

      "content": "How about feeling driven to perform certain behaviors or mental acts over and over again?"
    },
