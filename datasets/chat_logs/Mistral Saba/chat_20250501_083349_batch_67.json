It sounds like you've been feeling <sym>very down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, almost every day, and you mentioned that <quote>It's like a dark cloud is always hanging over me</quote>. It's also clear that these <sym>depressed moods</sym> have made it hard to find interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy. You've also been dealing with <sym>a lot of anxiety</sym>, feeling <sym>nervous</sym>, <sym>frightened</sym>, and <sym>on edge</sym>, and even having <sym>panic attacks</sym>. This has led you to <sym>avoid</sym> certain situations, which has made you feel <sym>isolated</sym> from others. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>memory problems</sym>. It's understandable that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been overwhelming, and it's important to address them together. I want to commend you for reaching out and taking the first step towards seeking support.\n\n**<med>Diagnosis:</med>**\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> <med>Features</med>\n\n**<med>Reasoning:</med>**\nThe patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for over two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates <med>Anxiety Features</med>. The patient's <sym>symptoms</sym> are not better explained by another <med>mental disorder</med>, and they cause significant <sym>impairment</sym> in the patient's social and occupational functioning. The patient's report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> may suggest a <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed to determine if these <symptoms</sym> are primary or secondary to the <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Features</med>.\n\n**<med>Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:</med>**\n1. Refer the patient to a <med>psychiatrist</med> or <med>mental health professional</med> for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and to discuss <med>pharmacological treatment options</med>.\n2. Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address the <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> <symptoms</sym>, focusing on <med>cognitive restructuring</med>, <med>behavioral activation</med>, and <med>exposure therapy</med>.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a consistent <med>sleep schedule</med> to improve overall mood and energy levels.\n4. Monitor the patient for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and provide appropriate safety planning if necessary.\n5. Consider <med>mindfulness-based interventions</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n6. Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive friends and family and consider joining a <med>support group</med> for individuals with similar experiences.\n7. Regularly review and adjust the <med>treatment plan</med> as needed, based on the patient's progress and feedback.",
