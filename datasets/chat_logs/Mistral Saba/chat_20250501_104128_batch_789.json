      "predicted": "You've shared some very challenging experiences and feelings with me. It sounds like you've been struggling with a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, and a noticeable decline in your energy levels. You've also been dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>unexplained physical pains</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. Your feelings of detachment and lack of closeness with others have also been impacting your social life. It's important to acknowledge the strength it took to share these details, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent depressive mood, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> that have been present for an extended period. These <sym>symptoms</sym> align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not currently intense, is a significant concern. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> are common comorbidities with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, but do not meet the threshold for separate diagnoses at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive symptoms and improve coping strategies.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and potential initiation of <med>antidepressant medication</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Anxiety Management:** Incorporate <med>anxiety management techniques</med> such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, and gradual exposure to anxiety-inducing situations.\n5. **Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation:** Regularly assess <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient has a safety plan in place, including emergency contacts and resources.\n6. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive relationships and consider support groups or family therapy to address feelings of detachment and social isolation.\n7. **Physical Health Monitoring:** Regularly assess and address <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> to ensure they are not indicative of an underlying medical condition.",
