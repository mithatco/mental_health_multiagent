You've expressed feeling down and hopeless, with a persistent sense of pointlessness, which can be incredibly challenging to manage. It's clear that you're experiencing a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as playing the guitar. Additionally, you're dealing with significant irritability and anxiety, which can make it hard to cope with daily stressors. Sleep disturbances, including excessive sleeping and poor sleep quality, are also affecting you. You've mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, which can be quite disorienting. It's also concerning to hear about the physical symptoms you're experiencing, such as headaches and stomachaches, which may be contributing to your overall distress. Moreover, you've mentioned feelings of distance in your relationships and occasional substance use, which could be coping mechanisms but may also exacerbate your current state. It's important to acknowledge the emotional and physical burden you're carrying, and I'm here to support you in finding a path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <anxiety features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pervasive negative affect, including <depressed mood>, <anhedonia>, <sleep disturbances>, and <identity confusion>, which are core <symptoms> of <major depressive disorder (MDD)>. The presence of <anxiety features>, such as persistent <anxiety>, <panic attacks>, and <avoidance behaviors>, further supports the diagnosis. The patient's <substance use> and <medication misuse> could be indicative of self-medication for underlying <mental health> issues. The <somatic symptoms> and feelings of detachment could also be related to <depression> or co-occurring <anxiety> or <somatoform disorders>. The patient's <relationship strain> and <identity confusion> suggest interpersonal and existential concerns that are common in <MDD>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address <depressive symptoms>, <anxiety>, and <avoidance behaviors>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Evaluation**: Consider a psychiatric evaluation for <antidepressant> medication to manage <depressive symptoms> and <anxiety>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) could be beneficial.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Address <sleep disturbances> through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, sleep-specific interventions or medications.\n4. **Substance Use Assessment**: Conduct a thorough assessment of <substance use> and <medication misuse> to develop a plan for safe and effective management.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy**: Address <relationship strain> and <identity confusion> through interpersonal therapy to improve social functioning and self-awareness.\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Ideation**: Given the presence of <suicidal ideation>, it is crucial to monitor the patient closely and ensure they have a safety plan in place.\n7. **Collaboration with Primary Care**: Work closely with the patient's primary care provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to <somatic symptoms> and to ensure coordinated care.",

      "predicted": "**Compassionate Summary**\n\nIt sounds like you've been going through a really tough time recently. You've expressed feeling down and hopeless, with a persistent sense of pointlessness, which can be incredibly challenging to manage. It's clear that you're experiencing a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as playing the guitar. Additionally, you're dealing with significant irritability and anxiety, which can make it hard to cope with daily stressors. Sleep disturbances, including excessive sleeping and poor sleep quality, are also affecting you. You've mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, which can be quite disorienting. It's also concerning to hear about the physical symptoms you're experiencing, such as headaches and stomachaches, which may be contributing to your overall distress. Moreover, you've mentioned feelings of distance in your relationships and occasional substance use, which could be coping mechanisms but may also exacerbate your current state. It's important to acknowledge the emotional and physical burden you're carrying, and I'm here to support you in finding a path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with <anxiety features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pervasive negative affect, including <depressed mood>, <anhedonia>, <sleep disturbances>, and <identity confusion>, which are core <symptoms> of <major depressive disorder (MDD)>. The presence of <anxiety features>, such as persistent <anxiety>, <panic attacks>, and <avoidance behaviors>, further supports the diagnosis. The patient's <substance use> and <medication misuse> could be indicative of self-medication for underlying <mental health> issues. The <somatic symptoms> and feelings of detachment could also be related to <depression> or co-occurring <anxiety> or <somatoform disorders>. The patient's <relationship strain> and <identity confusion> suggest interpersonal and existential concerns that are common in <MDD>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address <depressive symptoms>, <anxiety>, and <avoidance behaviors>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. **Medication Evaluation**: Consider a psychiatric evaluation for <antidepressant> medication to manage <depressive symptoms> and <anxiety>. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) could be beneficial.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Address <sleep disturbances> through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, sleep-specific interventions or medications.\n4. **Substance Use Assessment**: Conduct a thorough assessment of <substance use> and <medication misuse> to develop a plan for safe and effective management.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy**: Address <relationship strain> and <identity confusion> through interpersonal therapy to improve social functioning and self-awareness.\n6. **Monitoring for Suicidal Ideation**: Given the presence of <suicidal ideation>, it is crucial to monitor the patient closely and ensure they have a safety plan in place.\n7. **Collaboration with Primary Care**: Work closely with the patient's primary care provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to <somatic symptoms> and to ensure coordinated care.",
