Additionally, the patient reports cognitive impairment, dissociation, and feelings of disconnection from both themselves and others. These symptoms suggest a complex psychiatric presentation that requires further evaluation and treatment. The presence of suicidal ideation and avoidance behaviors highlights the need for immediate attention and a comprehensive treatment plan.",
