The symptoms described, such as periods of elevated mood and increased energy, depressed mood, and anhedonia, are consistent with bipolar II disorder. However, I wouldn't rate my confidence as a 5 because the diagnosis is listed as 'Provisional Impression', indicating that further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.",

      "predicted": "I've listened carefully to your experiences over the past two weeks, and it's clear you've been dealing with a range of challenging <sym>symptoms</sym>. You've expressed feelings of depression and hopelessness, which can be incredibly difficult to manage. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with periods of elevated energy and impulsive behaviors. It's also important to note your feelings of disconnection from yourself and others, as well as the fluctuating nature of your relationships. These experiences can be overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're taking steps to seek understanding and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (Provisional Impression)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with periods of elevated <sym>mood</sym> and increased energy, which suggest a <med>bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including worries and avoidance behaviors, meet the criteria for <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The provisional impression is due to the need for further evaluation to rule out other potential <med>mood disorders</med> and to determine the severity and stability of the <med>bipolar II disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to improve relationship satisfaction and address <sym>identity concerns</sym>.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> and <med>antidepressants</med> to manage <med>bipolar II disorder</med> symptoms, and <med>anxiolytics</med> for <sym>anxiety</sym> management, under the supervision of a psychiatrist.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and establish a consistent sleep pattern.\n5. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>suicidal risk assessment</med> to ensure the patient's safety and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n6. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Assess the patient's <med>substance use</med> patterns and provide education and support to prevent escalation, considering the potential for <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n7. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
