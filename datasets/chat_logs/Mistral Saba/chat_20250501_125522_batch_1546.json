      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been feeling overwhelmed and disconnected lately. You've shared that you're experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and a sense of emptiness, with little interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned feeling constantly <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, which has led to <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors and social withdrawal. The <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> you're experiencing are likely contributing to your <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and feeling of being disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. It's understandable that these feelings can make it difficult to find meaning and purpose in life. Your occasional thoughts of self-harm, while not acted upon, are concerning and should be addressed.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Probable Major Depressive Episode without <med>psychotic features</med> and co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>, including persistent <sym>sad mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>. Additionally, the patient reports significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including constant <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of <med>psychotic features</med> (such as hallucinations or delusions) is noted based on the patient's reports. The diagnosis is provisional, as the symptoms have been present for a duration less than the required two weeks, and further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Develop a comprehensive treatment plan, including <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Encourage regular <med>physical activity</med> and a balanced <med>diet</med> to improve overall well-being and energy levels.\n5. Establish a consistent <med>sleep hygiene routine</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. Provide support and resources for building a strong social support network to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n7. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n8. Implement <med>suicide prevention strategies</med> and provide resources for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including a safety plan and emergency contacts.",
