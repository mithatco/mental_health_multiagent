This assessment is designed to help us better understand how you're feeling and how it's affecting your life. Your responses will be kept strictly confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. This assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking each one of them. Let's start with the first question. Have you been feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"
