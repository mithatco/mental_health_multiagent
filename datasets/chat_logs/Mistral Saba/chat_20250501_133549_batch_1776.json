It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed lately, with a persistent sense of sadness and a lack of enjoyment in things you used to love. You've also been experiencing a lot of worry and anxiety, which has led you to isolate yourself and avoid social situations. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been accompanied by physical discomfort and a sense of being disconnected from yourself and others. Additionally, you've mentioned some concerns about substance use and fleeting thoughts of self-harm. It's clear that you're going through a challenging time, and I'm here to help you navigate this together.\n\n**<Diagnosis:>**\n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**<Reasoning:>**\n\nThe diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by the patient's report of persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym> (<quote>I snap at people for no reason</quote>). The patient's <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>generalized worry</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, further support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>uneasiness</sym> with physical symptoms and <sym>feelings of being taken seriously</sym> may indicate a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's misuse of <med>painkillers</med> and occasional excessive <med>alcohol</med> consumption suggest a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The fleeting thoughts of self-harm, although not currently serious, warrant close monitoring for potential escalation. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>difficulties in relationships</sym> further suggest a psychosocial component to their distress.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:>**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n2. Initiate a course of <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address the patient's <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>CBT</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. Monitor the patient's <med>substance use</med> and provide education on the risks and consequences. Consider referral to a <med>substance abuse</med> specialist if necessary.\n4. Recommend a sleep hygiene program to improve the patient's sleep quality and duration.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a balanced diet to support overall mental and physical health.\n6. Continue to monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and provide appropriate support and resources as needed. Develop a safety plan with the patient to address any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.\n7. Consider medication management to address the patient's <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be considered based on the patient's symptoms and response to treatment.",

Anxiety symptoms, including generalized anxiety and panic attacks, are also prominent. The patient reports somatic symptoms and dissociative feelings, which may be related to the underlying affective disturbances. The patient's social withdrawal and difficulties in relationships further suggest a psychosocial component to their distress. Substance misuse, including occasional excessive alcohol consumption and overuse of painkillers, is noted and warrants further evaluation. The patient's fleeting thoughts of self-harm, although not currently serious, necessitate close monitoring for escalation. Overall, the patient's presentation suggests a multifaceted mental health challenge requiring comprehensive assessment and intervention.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences with me today. It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed lately, with a persistent sense of sadness and a lack of enjoyment in things you used to love. You've also been experiencing a lot of worry and anxiety, which has led you to isolate yourself and avoid social situations. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been accompanied by physical discomfort and a sense of being disconnected from yourself and others. Additionally, you've mentioned some concerns about substance use and fleeting thoughts of self-harm. It's clear that you're going through a challenging time, and I'm here to help you navigate this together.\n\n**<Diagnosis:>**\n\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**<Reasoning:>**\n\nThe diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by the patient's report of persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym> (<quote>I snap at people for no reason</quote>). The patient's <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>generalized worry</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, further support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>uneasiness</sym> with physical symptoms and <sym>feelings of being taken seriously</sym> may indicate a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's misuse of <med>painkillers</med> and occasional excessive <med>alcohol</med> consumption suggest a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The fleeting thoughts of self-harm, although not currently serious, warrant close monitoring for potential escalation. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>difficulties in relationships</sym> further suggest a psychosocial component to their distress.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:>**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n2. Initiate a course of <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address the patient's <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>CBT</med> can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. Monitor the patient's <med>substance use</med> and provide education on the risks and consequences. Consider referral to a <med>substance abuse</med> specialist if necessary.\n4. Recommend a sleep hygiene program to improve the patient's sleep quality and duration.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a balanced diet to support overall mental and physical health.\n6. Continue to monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and provide appropriate support and resources as needed. Develop a safety plan with the patient to address any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.\n7. Consider medication management to address the patient's <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be considered based on the patient's symptoms and response to treatment.",
