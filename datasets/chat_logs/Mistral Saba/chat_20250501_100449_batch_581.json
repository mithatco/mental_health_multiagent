There is also evidence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, characterized by persistent anxiety, worry, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances, dissociation, and social withdrawal are notable additional concerns. The patient denies current suicidal ideation or substance use, but these areas need to be monitored. Further assessment and intervention should focus on supporting the patient's emotional regulation, improving sleep hygiene, and fostering social connection.",
