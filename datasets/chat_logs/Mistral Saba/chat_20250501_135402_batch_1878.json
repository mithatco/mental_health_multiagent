        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to the diagnostic conclusions. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder was well-supported by the patient's reported symptoms, and alternative diagnoses were implicitly considered through the comprehensive assessment.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. The interactions were warm and personalized, providing a supportive environment for the patient to share their concerns."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional performance across all criteria. The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, asked clinically relevant questions, maintained a logical flow, provided clear diagnostic justification, and interacted with empathy and professionalism. The comprehensive assessment and supportive interaction likely helped the patient feel understood and prepared for further treatment.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> often, with a notable loss of interest in things you used to enjoy. It's also clear that you've been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the future and feeling <sym>on edge</sym>. You've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including both oversleeping and undersleeping. It's understandable that these <sym>sleepless nights</sym> and <sym>sleeping too much</sym> would lead to <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. It's also concerning that you've withdrawn from social interactions, as this can often exacerbate feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>worthlessness</sym>.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>worries</sym>, and <sym>avoidant behavior</sym> suggest a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>physical complaints</sym> further exacerbate their mental health issues. The patient's withdrawal from social interactions and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> highlight the severity of their condition. The patient does not endorse <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, but the presence of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> should be monitored closely.\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Evaluate the patient for potential pharmacotherapy, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help regulate <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and improve overall sleep quality.\n4. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support systems and consider <med>group therapy</med> or support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.\n6. **Psychological Assessment:** Consider further psychological assessment to evaluate <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and rule out other potential underlying conditions.",
