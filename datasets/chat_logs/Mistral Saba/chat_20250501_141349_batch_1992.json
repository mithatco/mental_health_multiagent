Please know that this conversation is confidential, and we aim to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll ask you 23 questions, and you can respond with how much or how often you've been bothered by each issue in the past two weeks. Would you like to begin with the first question?"

The patient also experiences dissociative symptoms, including feelings of depersonalization and derealization, and reports significant interpersonal challenges, including social withdrawal and feelings of being a burden to others.

      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness and honesty in sharing your experiences. It's clear that you've been struggling with a significant amount of <sym>emotional distress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> over the past two weeks. You've described feeling consistently <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a noticeable lack of <sym>interest</sym> or <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and on edge, with frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> that have led you to avoid certain situations. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. It's understandable that these experiences have taken a toll on your <quote>interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> and your relationships with others.\n\n***Diagnosis:** Clinical Impression: Major Depressive Disorder with <sym>anxiety</sym> features and possible <sym>panic disorder</sym>\n\n***Reasoning:** based on the patient's self-reported symptoms, they meet the criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. Symptoms include <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The presence of frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> suggests a <sym>panic disorder</sym> as well. The feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> could indicate a <sym>dissociative disorder</sym>, but further evaluation is needed to determine if these symptoms are severe enough to warrant a separate diagnosis. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>feelings of being a burden</sym> may be related to the <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, but could also indicate a <sym>social anxiety disorder</sym> or other <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> that need to be addressed.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential <med>medical conditions</med> or <med>substance use disorders</med> that could be contributing to the symptoms. 2. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address both the <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, with a focus on <sym>panic disorder</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. 3. Consider <med>medication management</med> to help alleviate <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be appropriate choices. 4. Encourage the patient to engage in regular <med>physical activity</med> and maintain a consistent <med>sleep schedule</med> to improve overall well-being and <sym>sleep quality</sym>. 5. Explore <med>interpersonal therapy</med> or <med>group therapy</med> to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>. 6. Monitor the patient for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> throughout treatment, and ensure safety planning is in place if necessary. 7. Educate the patient and their <med>support system</med> about <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic disorder</sym> to reduce stigma and encourage involvement in treatment.",
