Significant anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and dissociative experiences are also noted.

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other relevant areas, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally align with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about sleep disturbances, the therapist could have been more specific about the types of sleep issues (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia). However, overall, the questions were clinically accurate and targeted relevant symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and adequately followed up on concerning disclosures. The conversation had a coherent and logical structure, making it easy to follow and understand.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a clear rationale for the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder with mixed features and co-occurring Anxiety Disorder, directly citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments where the tone seemed slightly more formal or technical than necessary. For example, when discussing suicidal thoughts, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a warm and supportive tone throughout the conversation."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively explored all relevant dimensions. The conversation flowed logically, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language and additional emotional validation, the therapist's performance was generally excellent.",
