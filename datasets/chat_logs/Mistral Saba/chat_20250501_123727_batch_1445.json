Each question was followed up with appropriate probing when needed, and no dimensions were skipped.

The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, and questions logically built on previous responses, creating a smooth conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis linked to DSM-5 criteria. Alternative diagnoses were considered and ruled out where appropriate.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm, personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

      "predicted": "I appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with me. It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time. You've expressed feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness, increased irritability, and overwhelming anxiety. You've also mentioned troubling <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and feelings of detachment from yourself and others. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been impacting your daily life and relationships. You've also mentioned some <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and it's understandable that you might feel frustrated when these are not taken seriously. It's important to know that your feelings are valid, and it's commendable that you've reached out for support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD) and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> also support these diagnoses. Additionally, the patient's <sym>feeling of not being taken seriously</sym> about their <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <sym>feeling detached</sym> from oneself and surroundings might indicate <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>, but these should be considered with caution and further assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychotherapy</med>: Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic disorder</med> symptoms. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n2. <med>Medication Management</med>: Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation to determine if <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> would be beneficial. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n\n3. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med>: Provide the patient with strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n\n4. <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med>: Address the patient's <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> through <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</med> (IPT) to improve social functioning and relationships.\n\n5. <med>Monitoring and Follow-Up</med>: Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and overall mental state. Ensure the patient has a safety plan in place and knows how to access emergency services if needed.\n\n6. <med>Collaboration with Primary Care Provider</med>: Coordinate with the patient's primary care provider to rule out any <med>medical causes</med> for <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> and to ensure comprehensive care.\n\n7. <med>Psychoeducation</med>: Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and other relevant <med>mental health conditions</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.",
