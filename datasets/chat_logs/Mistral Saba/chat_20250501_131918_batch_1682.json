The patient also exhibits symptoms of generalized anxiety and social anxiety, with avoidance behaviors and panic-like symptoms. Mild dissociative symptoms are noted, characterized by feelings of detachment. The patient reports a sense of disconnection from others and uncertainty about personal identity and life goals.
