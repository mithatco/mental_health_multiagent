This questionnaire will help us understand which areas of your mental health might need further attention. Your answers will remain confidential, and I promise to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll read each one aloud. Let's start whenever you're ready. First question: Have you been feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things lately?"

These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and possible GAD. The patient's reports of dissociative symptoms and avoidance behaviors also warrant further exploration. Given the patient's denial of substance use and psychotic symptoms, further assessment should focus on mood, anxiety, and interpersonal functioning. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor the patient's symptom severity and potential risk of suicide, with a focus on safety planning and support.",
