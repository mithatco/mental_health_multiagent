We will go through 23 questions, and you can answer based on how much or how often you have been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's begin."

It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time recently, with <sym>decreased interest</sym> in activities you usually enjoy, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> before social events. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>feeling disconnected</sym> from yourself and others, and <sym>occasionally feeling</sym> that you're not being taken seriously. It's important to recognize that these feelings are valid and deserve attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mild to Moderate Depressive Episode</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports several <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>depressive episode</med>, including <sym>decreased interest/pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>increased sleep duration</sym> which is often associated with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> of social situations, suggests comorbid <med>anxiety</med> features. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>increased sleep duration but poor sleep quality</sym> indicates a potential <med>sleep-wake disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>feeling that you are not close to other people or enjoying your relationships with them</quote> and <quote>feeling that you don't know who you really are or what you want out of life</quote> further supports the presence of <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> features. The patient's <quote>stomach issues</quote> could be related to <sym>stress</sym> and are not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Referral to a Mental Health Professional:** Refer the patient to a mental health professional for a more comprehensive evaluation and ongoing support.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to address the <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, focusing on <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>behaviors</sym>, and <sym>social avoidance</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>duration</sym>.\n4. **Monitoring of Symptoms:** Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep</sym> patterns to assess the effectiveness of interventions and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. **Explore Medication Options:** If appropriate, discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication options with the patient to help manage their <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n6. **Support System Engagement:** Encourage the patient to engage with their support system, including family and friends, to combat feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.\n7. **Identity Exploration:** Facilitate interventions that help the patient explore and clarify their personal identity and life goals.\n8. **Psychoeducation:** Provide <med>psychoeducation</med> about <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> disorders to help the patient understand their experiences and develop coping strategies.",
