You've mentioned feeling a lack of interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, difficulty sleeping, and intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> that lead to <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>. You've also shared that you feel distant from others and unsure about your identity and life goals. It's understandable that these experiences can be overwhelming, and I appreciate your openness about them. It's important to remember that these feelings are valid and can be addressed with the right support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on the responses, you've reported multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with <med>MDD</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest <med>GAD</med>. Additionally, the presence of intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> indicates <med>OCD</med>. The pattern of <sym>symptoms</sym> is consistent with these diagnoses, but further evaluation is needed to confirm.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Psychotherapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>, and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) for <med>OCD</med>.\n2.

Sleep Hygiene: Implement good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. Interpersonal Therapy: Address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and improve social functioning.\n5. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Incorporate these to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>.\n6. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n7. Education: Learn about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to better understand your experiences and cope effectively.",
