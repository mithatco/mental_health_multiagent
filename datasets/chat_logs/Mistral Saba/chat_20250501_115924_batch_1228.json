The patient's sleep disturbances, increased alcohol use, and feelings of hopelessness require careful monitoring for suicidal risk. The patient\u2019s symptoms are likely interconnected, with trauma-related issues playing a significant role in the overall mental health presentation. A comprehensive assessment and a multidisciplinary approach, including trauma-focused therapy and potential pharmacologic interventions, are recommended to address these complex symptoms.",

The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, etc., and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist phrased questions in clinically accurate ways that align with DSM-5 terminology and did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, each question naturally follows from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured smooth transitions and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cite specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis explicitly links to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses show consistent empathy, natural conversational style, and appropriate professional tone. The therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state and acknowledged patient distress without clinical detachment or overly technical language."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates exceptional performance across all criteria. The therapist thoroughly explored all DSM-5 dimensions, asked clinically relevant questions, maintained a logical flow, provided clear diagnostic justification, and interacted with empathy and professionalism.
