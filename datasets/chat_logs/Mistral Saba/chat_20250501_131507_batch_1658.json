It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, experiencing feelings of depression, anxiety, and physical discomfort. It's clear that you've been feeling down and less interested in activities you usually enjoy, and you've had moments of feeling panicked and on edge. You've also mentioned some concerning thoughts and behaviors, such as suicidal ideation and <sym>substance misuse</sym>. Additionally, you've been dealing with <sym>chronic pain</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be quite debilitating. It's also important to note your feelings of detachment and identity confusion, which can be very isolating. Thank you for your honesty and bravery in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple symptoms consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym> occurring several days a week, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a key feature of severe <med>depression</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>anxious distress</sym>, including <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors. The patient's report of <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>, <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further supports a diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>. The <sym>substance misuse</sym> reported by the patient may be a coping mechanism for the <sym>emotional pain</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> experienced, but it does not negate the primary diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based psychotherapies to address <med>depression</med>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Collaborate with a psychiatrist to consider <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <med>depression</med> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's <sym>substance use</sym> and provide appropriate interventions, such as <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment or support groups.\n4. **Pain Management:** Address <sym>chronic pain</sym> through a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, pain management techniques, and <med>pain management</med> medication if necessary.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies and, if necessary, consult a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n7. **Suicide Prevention:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, implement a <med>safety plan</med> and ensure the patient has access to crisis resources and support.\n8. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider involving them in the treatment process to provide additional support.",

      "predicted": "I truly appreciate your willingness to share your experiences with me today. It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, experiencing feelings of depression, anxiety, and physical discomfort. It's clear that you've been feeling down and less interested in activities you usually enjoy, and you've had moments of feeling panicked and on edge. You've also mentioned some concerning thoughts and behaviors, such as suicidal ideation and <sym>substance misuse</sym>. Additionally, you've been dealing with <sym>chronic pain</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be quite debilitating. It's also important to note your feelings of detachment and identity confusion, which can be very isolating. Thank you for your honesty and bravery in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple symptoms consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym> occurring several days a week, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a key feature of severe <med>depression</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>anxious distress</sym>, including <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors. The patient's report of <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>, <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further supports a diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>. The <sym>substance misuse</sym> reported by the patient may be a coping mechanism for the <sym>emotional pain</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> experienced, but it does not negate the primary diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based psychotherapies to address <med>depression</med>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Collaborate with a psychiatrist to consider <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <med>depression</med> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's <sym>substance use</sym> and provide appropriate interventions, such as <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment or support groups.\n4. **Pain Management:** Address <sym>chronic pain</sym> through a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, pain management techniques, and <med>pain management</med> medication if necessary.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies and, if necessary, consult a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n7. **Suicide Prevention:** Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, implement a <med>safety plan</med> and ensure the patient has access to crisis resources and support.\n8. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider involving them in the treatment process to provide additional support.",
