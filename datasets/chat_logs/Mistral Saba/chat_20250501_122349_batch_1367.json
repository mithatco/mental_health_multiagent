Key symptoms include decreased interest, irritability, sleep disturbances, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, somatic complaints, identity concerns, and relational distancing. These symptoms collectively point to a clinically significant level of distress that requires further evaluation and intervention.

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling less interested in activities you used to enjoy, increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and avoiding social situations. You've also experienced some <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, and you've been feeling distant from your friends and family. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features, <med>Insomnia</med>, and <med>Cognitive Impairment</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>decreased interest</sym> in activities and social interactions, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as nervousness, panic, and avoidance behaviors. These symptoms are consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features. The <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> in the form of forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating, as well as <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, further support this diagnosis. The <sym>identity concerns</sym> and <sym>relationship issues</sym> are also common in <med>depressive disorders</med>. The <med>Insomnia</med> is noted as a separate diagnosis due to its significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The symptoms do not meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as the <sym>physical symptoms</med> are not disproportionate to the severity of the underlying <med>mental health</med> issues. The patient does not report <sym>psychotic features</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is reassuring but warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychological Evaluation**: Conduct a comprehensive psychological evaluation to further assess the severity and impact of the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention**: Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anxiolytics</med> may be beneficial in managing the symptoms.\n3. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Recommend CBT to help the patient develop coping strategies for <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve sleep quality and address <med>insomnia</med>.\n5. **Supportive Therapy**: Encourage <med>supportive therapy</med> to help the patient navigate <sym>identity concerns</sym> and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n6. **Follow-Up Appointments**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n7. **Family Involvement**: Involve the patient's family or close friends in the treatment process to provide a support system and enhance the patient's sense of connection.",
