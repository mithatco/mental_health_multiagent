The therapist systematically explored depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, cognitive function, and other key domains. For example, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' to assess depressive symptoms, and 'feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge' for anxiety symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, the therapist asked about 'unexplained aches and pains' to assess somatic symptoms and 'problems with sleep that affected your sleep quality overall' for sleep disturbances. The questions were phrased in a way that maintained their clinical meaning and relevance.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For example, after the patient mentioned feelings of hopelessness, the therapist asked about sleep disturbances, which logically followed from the patient's symptoms. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Depressive Disorder, Current Severity Specified, clearly aligns with the patient's DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as decreased interest or pleasure in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and sleep disturbances. The therapist also considered alternative explanations and provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, the therapist expressed understanding and support when the patient shared feelings of disconnection from others. The interactions were warm, personalized, and professional."

You've shared that you've been feeling down and losing interest in the things you used to enjoy, which has been accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and a lack of energy. Your sleep has been all over the place, with periods of insomnia and hypersomnia, and you've noted some cognitive difficulties and feelings of disconnection from others. It's clear that these experiences have been weighing heavily on you, and I appreciate you opening up about them.**\n\n**Diagnosis: Depressive Disorder, Current Severity Specified**\n\n**Reasoning: The patient presents with multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>decreased interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as insomnia and hypersomnia. These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been occurring for some time and are causing significant distress. The patient also reports <sym>cognitive</sym> difficulties and <sym>emotional detachment</sym>, which are often associated with <med>depressive disorders</med>. Although the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> with intent, the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent is noted. The patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> may be secondary to the underlying <med>depressive disorder</med>.
