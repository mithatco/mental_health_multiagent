      "predicted": "I understand that you've been going through a challenging time. You've shared that you've been feeling a lack of interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, feeling down and depressed, and experiencing constant anxiety and panic attacks. You also mentioned having intrusive thoughts and feeling driven to perform repetitive behaviors, such as excessive hand-washing and checking rituals. Additionally, you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, experiencing poor sleep quality, and having unexplained aches and pains. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent lack of interest and pleasure in activities, feelings of depression, and a heavy feeling in the chest, which are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>depression</med>). Constant feelings of anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, such as excessive hand-washing and checking rituals, are indicative of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>OCD</med>). The patient's feelings of detachment could be a symptom of <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, or a <med>dissociative disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed. The patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym> could be psychogenic in nature, indicating a need for further medical evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n\n2. Consider a combination of <med>psychotherapy</med> and <med>medication</med> to address the <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med>. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> is particularly effective for these conditions.\n\n3. Encourage the patient to maintain a regular sleep schedule and practice good sleep hygiene to improve sleep quality. If sleep disturbances persist, consider a referral to a sleep specialist.\n\n4. Monitor the patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and refer them to a primary care physician for a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\n5. Provide the patient with psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to help them understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and the available treatment options.\n\n6. Continuously assess the patient's risk for <med>suicidal ideation</med> and provide appropriate support and resources if necessary.",
