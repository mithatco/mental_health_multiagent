You've also mentioned <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can all be quite debilitating. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>relationship strain</sym>, and you've turned to <sym>increased alcohol consumption</sym> to cope. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings and behaviors are significant, and it's commendable that you're seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis: <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>.

The patient's <sym>increased alcohol consumption</sym> and potential <sym>overuse of prescribed medications</sym> suggest a <med>substance use disorder</med>, as these behaviors are used to cope with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Monitor the use of <med>prescribed medications</med> to prevent <sym>overuse</sym>.\n\n3. **Substance Use Support:** Participate in <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment programs, such as <med>alcoholics anonymous (AA)</med> or <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy for substance use disorders</med>, to address <sym>alcohol</sym> consumption and prevent <sym>overuse of prescribed medications</med>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>caffeine</sym> close to bedtime.\n\n5. **Social Support:** Engage in support groups or <med>interpersonal psychotherapy</med> to improve <sym>relationship difficulties</sym> and reduce <sym>social isolation</sym>. Building a support network can help the patient feel more connected and less <sym>detached</sym> from others.\n\n6. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-ups with a mental health professional to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This can help ensure that the patient's needs are being met and that the chosen interventions are effective.\n\n7. **Address Somatic Symptoms:** Work with a healthcare provider to address <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, which may be exacerbated by psychological distress. This could involve further medical evaluation and appropriate treatment, such as <med>pain management strategies</med>.\n\n8. **Identity Exploration:** Engage in activities or therapies that help the patient explore their identity and purpose, such as <med>existential psychotherapy</med> or <med>life coaching</med>. This can help the patient gain a better understanding of themselves and their goals.",
