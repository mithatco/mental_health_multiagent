The patient reports feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and anxiety, along with physical discomfort and cognitive difficulties. There is evidence of substance use to cope with symptoms, and the patient exhibits a pattern of withdrawal from social activities and relationships. The patient does not endorse any psychotic symptoms or dissociative experiences but reports anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and cognitive issues. The presence of suicidal ideation and self-medication with painkillers warrants immediate clinical attention and further evaluation. A comprehensive assessment and treatment plan should address both the psychiatric and somatic symptoms, with a focus on managing depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as addressing substance use and cognitive complaints. Further diagnostic clarification and ongoing monitoring are recommended.",
