They describe persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). The patient also reports increased irritability and anger, excessive sleep, and fatigue, which are common <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>MDD</med>. The patient exhibits significant anxiety, including feelings of being on edge, fear of impending doom, and difficulty breathing during panic attacks. These <sym>symptoms</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>) and <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient avoids situations that provoke anxiety, which may indicate <med>agoraphobia</med> or <med>social phobia</med>. The patient reports somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach issues, which, when combined with the feeling of not being taken seriously, may indicate <med>somatic symptom disorder</med> (<med>SSD</med>). The patient experiences intrusive thoughts and feels driven to perform repetitive behaviors, suggesting <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>). The patient reports feeling detached from their body and surroundings, which could indicate <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med>.

The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>GAD</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient's intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals are indicative of <med>OCD</med>. The patient's experiencing of depersonalization and derealization, as well as identity confusion, suggest <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med> and <med>identity disturbance</med>. The patient's somatic symptoms and feeling of not being taken seriously point to <med>SSD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>panic disorder</med>, and <med>OCD</med>. <med>Interpersonal therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) can also be beneficial for <med>MDD</med>. <med>Dialectical behavior therapy</med> (<med>DBT</med>) may help with <sym>depersonalization/derealization</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications to manage <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>panic disorder</med>. A <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SSRI</med>) or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SNRI</med>) may be considered for <med>OCD</med>.\n3. **Somatic Symptom Management:** Address somatic symptoms through a combination of psychotherapy and medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>panic disorder</med>, <med>OCD</med>, <med>SSD</med>, <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med>, and <med>identity disturbance</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support networks and consider support groups for <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>.\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.

It's almost like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> <quote>It's been pretty consistent. I wake up every day feeling like there's no point to anything, and it's hard to shake that feeling. It's like a dark cloud is hanging over me.</quote> <quote>Yeah, I've been snapping at people a lot more often. It's like I'm just on edge all the time. My partner has even mentioned it, and I feel bad about it.</quote> <quote>No, I've actually been sleeping a lot more. I just feel exhausted all the time, like I can't get enough sleep.</quote> <quote>Oh, definitely. I'm always on edge, like I'm waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting.</quote> <quote>There have been moments where I feel like I can't breathe, like something terrible is going to happen. It's scary.</quote> The patient has been experiencing a significant loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities, consistent with <sym>anhedonia</sym>. They describe persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). The patient also reports increased irritability and anger, excessive sleep, and fatigue, which are common <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>MDD</med>. The patient exhibits significant anxiety, including feelings of being on edge, fear of impending doom, and difficulty breathing during panic attacks. These <sym>symptoms</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>) and <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient avoids situations that provoke anxiety, which may indicate <med>agoraphobia</med> or <med>social phobia</med>. The patient reports somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomach issues, which, when combined with the feeling of not being taken seriously, may indicate <med>somatic symptom disorder</med> (<med>SSD</med>). The patient experiences intrusive thoughts and feels driven to perform repetitive behaviors, suggesting <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med> (<med>OCD</med>). The patient reports feeling detached from their body and surroundings, which could indicate <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient feels unsure about their identity and what they want out of life, which may suggest an <med>identity disturbance</med>. The patient has withdrawn from social relationships, feeling like a burden to others.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>, and <med>Identity Disturbance</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of anhedonia, persistent sadness, and low energy aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>GAD</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient's intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals are indicative of <med>OCD</med>. The patient's experiencing of depersonalization and derealization, as well as identity confusion, suggest <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med> and <med>identity disturbance</med>. The patient's somatic symptoms and feeling of not being taken seriously point to <med>SSD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>panic disorder</med>, and <med>OCD</med>. <med>Interpersonal therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) can also be beneficial for <med>MDD</med>. <med>Dialectical behavior therapy</med> (<med>DBT</med>) may help with <sym>depersonalization/derealization</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications to manage <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, and <med>panic disorder</med>. A <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SSRI</med>) or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</med> (<med>SNRI</med>) may be considered for <med>OCD</med>.\n3. **Somatic Symptom Management:** Address somatic symptoms through a combination of psychotherapy and medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>GAD</med>, <med>panic disorder</med>, <med>OCD</med>, <med>SSD</med>, <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med>, and <med>identity disturbance</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social support networks and consider support groups for <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>.\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed. Pay close attention to any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, as the patient reports feeling trapped in a dark place.",
