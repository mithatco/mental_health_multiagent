      "predicted": "I'm really sorry to hear that you've been struggling with such intense emotions and difficulties. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of <sym>pain</sym> and discomfort, including feeling <sym>depressed</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. These feelings have been impacting your ability to enjoy activities, sleep well, and maintain relationships, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's also concerning to hear that you've had thoughts of harming yourself, and I want to assure you that you're not alone and that help is available. It's important to take these thoughts seriously, and I'm here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are all key features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<MDD>). Additionally, the patient reports excessive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<GAD>). The co-occurrence of these symptoms is common, and the <med>DSM-5</med> allows for the specification of <med>Anxiety Features</med> in <MDD> when these symptoms are present. The patient's <sym>detachment</sym> from themselves and their surroundings may also suggest <med>Depersonalization/derealization Disorder</med>, but the prominent <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms are more consistent with <MDD> with <med>Anxiety Features</med>. The patient's symptoms are persistent and pervasive, significantly impacting their daily functioning, and the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates a need for immediate and careful assessment and management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate the patient's immediate risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> and develop a safety plan as needed.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<CBT>) or <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</med> (<IPT>) to address both <MDD> and <GAD> symptoms.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and management of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety</med> medication if indicated.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <MDD> and <GAD> to help the patient understand their symptoms and the available treatment options.\n5. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and overall functioning.",
