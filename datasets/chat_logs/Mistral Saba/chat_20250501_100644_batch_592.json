You've shared feeling a significant loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy, persistent <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and a constant state of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others, and you've been withdrawing from social activities. These feelings have been accompanied by physical <sym>symptoms</sym> like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, which you believe are related to <sym>stress</sym>. The fact that you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, even if you don't intend to act on them, is particularly concerning.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, which are core <symptom>s</symptom> of <med>depression</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are also common in <med>anxiety disorders</med>. The presence of <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> further supports the diagnosis, as they are often comorbid with <med>mental health issues</med>. The patient's <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> are also consistent with a <med>depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even without intent to act, is a significant risk factor.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n2. **Medication**: Refer the patient to a psychiatrist to discuss the possibility of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <med>anxiolytic medication</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Self-Care Strategies**: Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and practice <med>mindfulness</med> or <med>relaxation techniques</med> to manage <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. **Social Support**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive friends and family, and consider joining a support group for individuals with similar experiences.\n5. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. **Suicide Prevention**: Address the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> by developing a safety plan and providing resources for crisis intervention, such as the national suicide prevention hotline.",
