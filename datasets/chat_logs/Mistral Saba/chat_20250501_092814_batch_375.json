We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer them based on how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question."

It's understandable that these experiences feel overwhelming, and it's important to know that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>persistent feelings of depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, which are key symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>variable sleep patterns</sym> and <sym>overall poor sleep quality</sym> indicate a potential <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>.

CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that are contributing to their distress.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be beneficial for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, while <med>benzodiazepines</med> or <med>buspirone</med> could help with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social supports, such as friends and family. Social isolation can exacerbate <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, so rebuilding these connections is crucial.\n5. **Medical Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a primary care physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.",

The patient's reports of physical symptoms, cognitive difficulties, and social withdrawal further highlight the multifaceted nature of their distress. A comprehensive mental health assessment, including a thorough evaluation of suicidal risk and potential medical causes, is warranted. Treatment may involve a combination of psychotherapy and possibly medication to address both the mood and anxiety components of the patient's presentation.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through an incredibly challenging time, marked by persistent feelings of depression, anxiety, and a general sense of hopelessness. You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you once enjoyed, experience frequent irritability, and struggle with both oversleeping and feeling exhausted <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. Your worries about the future and ability to cope have left you feeling anxious and, at times, panicked. You've also mentioned unexplained physical symptoms, like headaches and stomach discomfort, and a sense of detachment from yourself and others. It's understandable that these experiences feel overwhelming, and it's important to know that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>persistent feelings of depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, which are key symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>variable sleep patterns</sym> and <sym>overall poor sleep quality</sym> indicate a potential <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym>, such as headaches and stomach discomfort, may be related to these <med>mood and anxiety disorders</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both the <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that are contributing to their distress.\n2. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anti-anxiety</med> medications. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be beneficial for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, while <med>benzodiazepines</med> or <med>buspirone</med> could help with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Support Network:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with social supports, such as friends and family. Social isolation can exacerbate <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, so rebuilding these connections is crucial.\n5. **Medical Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a primary care physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.",
