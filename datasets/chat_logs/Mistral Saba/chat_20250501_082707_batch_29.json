      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing significant emotional distress and physical symptoms over the past two weeks. You've described a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of hopelessness and depression, increased irritability, and challenges with sleep. Your anxiety and panic attacks seem to be particularly impactful, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> leading to avoidance behaviors and withdrawal from social interactions. You've also mentioned physical symptoms such as <sym>chest pain</sym> during panic attacks and feelings of detachment from yourself and the environment. It's understandable that these experiences have been overwhelming, and it's important to address them carefully.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<panic disorder with agoraphobia>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with symptoms consistent with <panic disorder with agoraphobia>. These include recurrent <sym>unexpected panic attacks</sym> accompanied by <sym>fear of impending doom</sym> and <sym>feeling detached from oneself</sym>, as well as <sym>avoidance of situations</sym> that may trigger panic attacks. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> significantly impact their daily life and social interactions, which is a key feature of agoraphobia. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are common comorbid conditions with <panic disorder>. While the patient denies suicidal ideation, the presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>chest pain</sym> warrants careful monitoring for potential risk.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychological Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough psychological evaluation to assess the severity of <panic disorder> and any comorbid conditions, such as <depression> and <anxiety>.\n\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to help the patient manage <panic attacks> and <anxiety>. CBT can also address <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n3. **Medication Review:** Review any current medications and consider prescribing anxiolytic medications or antidepressants to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Ensure that any chest pain is thoroughly evaluated medically to rule out any underlying <med>cardiac conditions</med>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n5. **Gradual Exposure Therapy:** Implement gradual exposure therapy to help the patient confront and manage <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to agoraphobia.\n\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
