Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported feelings of depression and hopelessness, the therapist probed further to understand the impact on daily life. The only potential area for improvement is that some questions could have been more detailed, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",

For instance, when asking about sleep quality, the therapist could have used more specific DSM-5 terminology. However, the questions were mostly clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms. With some refinement in question phrasing, this score could have been 5.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively built on the patient's disclosures to guide the conversation. For example, when the patient mentioned increased irritability, the therapist followed up with questions about anger management. The conversation had a coherent arc, and there were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder clearly aligns with the patient's reported symptoms, such as anhedonia, depressed mood, insomnia, hopelessness, and irritability. The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis. The justification for the diagnosis was well-articulated and clinically sound, making a strong case for the chosen diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a professional tone, but there were moments where responses seemed slightly impersonal or robotic. For instance, when the patient disclosed thoughts of detachment, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, the therapist mostly maintained a warm and personalized interaction, effectively tailoring responses to the patient's emotional state."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively explored all relevant dimensions. The conversation was logical, and the diagnostic justification was sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the performance was generally excellent. With some refinement in question phrasing and emotional validation, this conversation could serve as a model for future assessments.",

You've described a heavy weight on your chest, increased irritability, and difficulty controlling your temper. Sleep has been eluding you, with frequent awakenings and a constant sense of tiredness. Anxiety has become a persistent companion, making you feel worried and on edge, and sometimes frightened of losing control. You've also experienced unexplained back pain and occasional feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings. Your relationships with others feel strained, and you've been struggling with thoughts of identity and purpose. You've had a history of <med>substance use</med>, and there are occasional thoughts of resuming these behaviors.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with several key <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>major depressive disorder</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>.
