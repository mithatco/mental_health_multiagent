These ups and downs have also affected your sleep, with <sym>hypersomnia</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>insomnia</sym> during manic episodes. You've mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> as well, which are concerning and need to be addressed. Additionally, you've noted some withdrawal from social interactions during your depressive episodes, which is understandable given the emotional toll these periods take. It's commendable that you've been open about these experiences, as it's the first step in managing and treating them effectively.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of distinct periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The depressive episodes are characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, while the manic episodes include <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>increased irritability</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behavior</sym>. The patient's description of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> further supports the presence of a mood disorder with significant <sym>emotional dysregulation</sym>. The cyclical nature of these episodes and the impact on sleep and social functioning are also consistent with <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. While <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> is also present, the primary concern is the bipolar pattern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and rule out other possible conditions.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support systems.\n3. Initiate <med>mood stabilizing medications</med> to manage <sym>mood swings</sym> and prevent future episodes.\n4. Implement <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and develop coping skills for both depressive and manic episodes.\n5. Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through a combination of <med>sleep hygiene education</med>, <med>medications</med> if necessary, and <med>therapy</med> to improve sleep quality and regulation.\n6. Provide <med>psychoeducation</med> about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system understand the condition and its management.\n7. Encourage regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n8. Assess and address any interpersonal relationship concerns, especially during depressive episodes, to enhance social support and connection.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n#### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n- **Depressive Episodes:** The patient reports significant periods of feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, accompanied by a loss of interest in activities, anhedonia, and a lack of energy. These episodes are characterized by excessive sleep and persistent feelings of detachment and hopelessness.\n- **Manic/Anxiety Episodes:** During manic episodes, the patient experiences insomnia, irritability, and a surge of energy despite minimal sleep. These episodes are marked by increased irritability, a tendency to start multiple projects, and a lack of thorough decision-making.\n- **Anxiety:** The patient experiences constant, low-key anxiety, particularly during depressive episodes, with worries about potential negative outcomes. There is no reported avoidance of situations or panic attacks, but persistent worrying is noted.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, including hypersomnia during depressive episodes and insomnia during manic episodes.\n- **Thoughts of Death:** The patient mentions passive suicidal ideation, describing thoughts of death but not actively planning self-harm.\n\n#### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n- **Bipolar Symptoms:** The patient describes a clear cyclical pattern of depression and mania, with distinct periods of high and low moods.\n- **Sleep Dysregulation:** Sleep patterns are significantly disrupted during both depressive and manic episodes.\n- **Interpersonal Relationships:** The patient withdraws from social interactions during depressive episodes, but this pattern is not reported during manic episodes.\n- **Cognitive Changes:** The patient does not report significant cognitive impairments, such as memory problems or intrusive thoughts, but there is a feeling of detachment and existential uncertainty during depressive episodes.\n\n#### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n- **Bipolar Disorder:** The cyclical nature of depressive and manic episodes suggests a bipolar disorder, which requires further diagnostic clarification and treatment planning.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Although not severe, the patient's anxiety symptoms may warrant further evaluation and management.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Passive suicidal ideation, even if not actively planning, indicates a need for close monitoring and safety planning.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The impact of sleep disturbances on overall mental health and functioning is significant and should be addressed.\n\n#### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient's passive suicidal thoughts are a significant risk factor that requires immediate attention and safety planning.\n- **Manic Episodes:** The impulsive behavior and increased irritability during manic episodes pose risks to the patient's social and professional relationships, as well as personal safety.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Both hyper and hypo-somnia can exacerbate mental health symptoms and impact daily functioning.\n\n#### 5. Summary of Observations\nThe patient presents with a pattern of cyclical mood disturbances suggestive of bipolar disorder, characterized by periods of depression and mania. Depressive episodes are marked by anhedonia, hypersomnia, and feelings of hopelessness, while manic episodes are characterized by insomnia, increased irritability, and impulsive behavior. The patient also experiences persistent, low-key anxiety during depressive episodes and passive suicidal ideation. Sleep disturbances are prominent during both depressive and manic episodes, significantly impacting overall mental health and functioning. The patient does not report substance use or significant cognitive impairments but does experience social withdrawal during depressive episodes. These symptoms are of clinical significance and warrant further diagnostic evaluation, safety planning, and comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Further diagnostic evaluation to confirm bipolar disorder.\n- Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal ideation.\n- Address sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms.\n- Monitor for manic episodes and their associated risks.\n- Provide psychoeducation and therapy to manage mood episodes and anxiety.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences with me today. It's clear that you've been going through significant emotional and mental challenges. You've described a pattern of <sym>cyclical mood disturbances</sym>, with periods of feeling down and hopeless, as well as episodes of increased energy and irritability. These ups and downs have also affected your sleep, with <sym>hypersomnia</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>insomnia</sym> during manic episodes. You've mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> as well, which are concerning and need to be addressed. Additionally, you've noted some withdrawal from social interactions during your depressive episodes, which is understandable given the emotional toll these periods take. It's commendable that you've been open about these experiences, as it's the first step in managing and treating them effectively.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of distinct periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The depressive episodes are characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, while the manic episodes include <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>increased irritability</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behavior</sym>. The patient's description of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> further supports the presence of a mood disorder with significant <sym>emotional dysregulation</sym>. The cyclical nature of these episodes and the impact on sleep and social functioning are also consistent with <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. While <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> is also present, the primary concern is the bipolar pattern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and rule out other possible conditions.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support systems.\n3. Initiate <med>mood stabilizing medications</med> to manage <sym>mood swings</sym> and prevent future episodes.\n4. Implement <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and develop coping skills for both depressive and manic episodes.\n5. Address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through a combination of <med>sleep hygiene education</med>, <med>medications</med> if necessary, and <med>therapy</med> to improve sleep quality and regulation.\n6. Provide <med>psychoeducation</med> about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system understand the condition and its management.\n7. Encourage regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n8. Assess and address any interpersonal relationship concerns, especially during depressive episodes, to enhance social support and connection.",
