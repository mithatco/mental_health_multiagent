          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n**Patient Presentation:**\nThe patient reports experiencing significant distress related to panic attacks, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. There is a notable avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations and a general sense of feeling down and hopeless. The patient also describes disrupted sleep patterns, somatic symptoms, and feelings of detachment and loss of identity.\n\n**Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n1. **Anxiety and Panic:** Frequent feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge. Experiences panic attacks with symptoms of feeling like they are going to die or lose control.\n2. **Depression:** Reports of decreased interest in activities, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.\n3. **Sleep Disturbances:** Difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, waking up feeling tired and anxious.\n4. **Irritability:** Increased irritability and snapping at others.\n5. **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained headaches and back pain.\n6. **Avoidance Behaviors:** Avoids situations that trigger anxiety, such as public transport and crowded places.\n7. **Feelings of Detachment:** Experiences depersonalization during panic attacks.\n8. **Interpersonal Struggles:** Feeling disconnected from others and not enjoying relationships.\n9. **Identity Confusion:** Feels lost and unsure of self-identity.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\n- **Consistent Anxiety:** The patient reports feeling anxious and on edge almost all the time, with frequent panic attacks.\n- **Avoidance Mechanisms:** Avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations and withdrawal from social interactions.\n- **Sleep Disruption:** Persistent issues with sleep quality and quantity.\n- **Depression Symptoms:** Indicators of depressed mood, loss of pleasure, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Interpersonal Isolation:** Withdrawal from friends and family, possibly due to feelings of burdening them with personal problems.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n1. **Panic Disorder:** Symptoms align with Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder, including recurrent unexpected panic attacks and avoidance of situations where attacks have occurred.\n2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:** Persistent anxiety and worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors.\n3. **Major Depressive Disorder:** Symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness.\n4. **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Persistent insomnia and poor sleep quality.\n5. **Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder:** Feelings of detachment or being outside of oneself during panic attacks.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Although the patient denies active suicidal thoughts, there are indications of passive suicidal ideation (\"sometimes I wish I could just make everything stop\").\n- **Social Isolation:** Withdrawal from social supports could exacerbate existing symptoms and hinder coping mechanisms.\n- **Perceived Lack of Support:** Feelings that medical concerns are not taken seriously by healthcare providers.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Chronic sleep disruption can exacerbate both anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex interplay of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances. The prominent symptoms of anxiety and panic, coupled with avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, suggest a significant impact on daily functioning. The patient's feelings of hopelessness, identity confusion, and passive suicidal ideation warrant close monitoring and intervention. Further evaluation and treatment planning should focus on managing anxiety and panic, addressing depressive symptoms, and improving sleep quality. Interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be beneficial in addressing avoidance behaviors and social isolation.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been experiencing a significant amount of distress due to frequent <sym>panic</sym> attacks and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which has been quite challenging for you. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>depressed</sym>, <sym>irritable</sym>, and having trouble sleeping. It's been difficult for you to enjoy things you used to love, and you've felt <sym>hopeless</sym> at times. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself during these attacks and feeling like you're not sure who you are anymore. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe patient's report of recurrent <sym>unexpected panic attacks</sym>, <sym>frequent anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's description of <sym>feeling down</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> also meets the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> are also consistent with these diagnoses. The absence of other <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> or <med>substance use</med> supports these diagnoses. The patient's <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicates a need for careful monitoring and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> through evidence-based techniques such as exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for <med>depression</med> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>Benzodiazepines</med> can be considered for short-term management of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, but should be used cautiously due to the risk of dependence.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education and Therapy:** To improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and address <sym>insomnia</sym>. This may include behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).\n4. **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** To address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** To monitor <sym>symptoms</sym>, adjust treatments as needed, and ensure safety, particularly regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n6. **Referral to a Primary Care Physician:** To rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.",
