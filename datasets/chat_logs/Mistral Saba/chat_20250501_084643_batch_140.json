This assessment is designed to help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks.

Key symptoms include:\n\n- **Depression:** Feelings of hopelessness, lack of interest or pleasure in activities, feelings of worthlessness, and avoidance of social interactions.\n- **Manic/Hypomanic Episodes:** Increased energy, decreased need for sleep, increased irritability, and excessive involvement in activities and projects.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Both insomnia during manic episodes and hypersomnia during depressive episodes.\n- **Anxiety:** Experiences of nervousness, anxiety, and worry during depressive periods.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Physical issues related to mood fluctuations, although not necessarily unexplained.\n- **Interpersonal Issues:** Difficulty maintaining close relationships due to mood swings, with both withdrawal during depression and hyperactivity during mania.\n\n**Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- **Mood Lability:** The patient describes extreme fluctuations in mood, with periods of profound depression alternating with periods of elevated mood and increased energy.\n- **Sleep Patterns:** Significant disruption in sleep patterns, with insomnia during manic episodes and hypersomnia during depressive episodes.\n- **Behavioral Variability:** Increased activity and risk-taking during manic episodes, contrasted with avoidance and withdrawal during depression.\n- **Cognitive Function:** No reported issues with memory, but significant cognitive dissonance regarding self-identity and goals.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Bipolar Disorder:** The patient's description of depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes suggests a potential diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Further exploration of the duration, severity, and impact of these episodes is warranted.\n- **Anxiety:** The presence of anxiety symptoms during depressive episodes may indicate a co-occurring anxiety disorder.\n- **Psychosocial Impact:** The patient's social withdrawal and difficulties in maintaining relationships highlight the need for psychosocial support and interventions.\n- **Substance Use:** Despite no current substance use, the potential for substance misuse during manic episodes should be monitored.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports passive suicidal ideation during depressive episodes, although no active suicidal intent or plans.\n- **Hazardous Behaviors:** Increased risk-taking and impulsivity during manic episodes may lead to harmful behaviors.\n- **Social Isolation:** Withdrawal from social interactions during depression and potential social over-involvement during mania could exacerbate mood instability.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a clear pattern of mood instability, characterized by alternating periods of depression and mania/hypomania. This suggests a potential diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. The patient experiences significant sleep disturbances, anxiety during depressive episodes, and cognitive dissonance regarding self-identity. There is a notable impact on interpersonal relationships, with both withdrawal and over-involvement depending on mood state. The patient reports passive suicidal ideation during depressive episodes but denies any active intent or plans. Further assessment and monitoring are necessary to determine the severity and duration of these episodes and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

These fluctuations have been impacting your daily life, sleep patterns, and relationships. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming and confusing, and I'm here to help you navigate through them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar Disorder, <med>not otherwise specified</med> (<med>NOS</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a clear pattern of <sym>mood instability</sym>, with alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania/hypomania</sym>. They describe <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. They also report <sym>manic/hypomanic episodes</sym> marked by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. While the patient does not meet the full criteria for <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>, the presentation is not yet fully consistent with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> either, hence the <med>NOS</med> specifier.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a comprehensive evaluation and to consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med>, to manage the <sym>mood swings</sym>.\n2. Referral to a <med>psychotherapist</med> for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, improve <med>coping skills</med>, and address <med>interpersonal issues</med>.\n3. Regular follow-ups to monitor <med>symptom severity</med>, <med>substance use</med>, and <med>suicidal ideation</med>, with adjustments to the treatment plan as needed.\n4. Education about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help the patient understand their condition, recognize <med>trigger factors</med>, and develop a <med>wellness plan</med>.\n5. Involvement of a <med>support system</med>, such as family or friends, to provide emotional support and assistance in managing daily tasks during <sym>depressive episodes</sym>.\n6. Regular sleep hygiene assessment and support, as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are a significant factor in <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>.\n7. Monitoring for <med>co-occurring disorders</med>, such as <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and addressing them as needed.",
