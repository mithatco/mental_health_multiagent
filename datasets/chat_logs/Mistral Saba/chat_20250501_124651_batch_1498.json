This assessment is designed to help us understand how you have been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. We will go through 23 questions, and I will ask each one individually. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, given the range of <sym>emotions</sym> and <sym>physical sensations</sym> you've been dealing with. It's clear that the past few weeks have been incredibly challenging, with feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym> taking a toll on your daily life. It's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to share these experiences, and I'm here to support you and find a way forward together.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> Features and <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe patient reports several key <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with both <med>major depressive disorder</med> and <med>traumatic stress disorder</med>. <quote>I used to enjoy things so much, but lately, it's just been hard to find joy in anything.</quote> <quote>Sometimes I feel like there's no point in anything. Like nothing matters anymore.</quote> These quotes highlight <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about a past accident, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as avoiding driving and crowded places suggest a <med>traumatic stress disorder</med> diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>generalized anxiety</sym> further support an <med>anxiety</med> component. The patient's history of a past accident, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> also indicate the possibility of <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med>.\n\nThe patient's <quote>occasional thoughts of self-harm</quote> and <quote>I've been drinking more to help me sleep</quote> warrant immediate attention and intervention. The patient's <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, suggesting a need for a comprehensive approach to treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>major depressive disorder</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This evidence-based treatment can help the patient manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms by challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n3. **Trauma-Focused Therapy:** Given the history of a past accident and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or <med>Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)</med> could be beneficial.\n\n4. **Medication Review:** Evaluate the patient's current medication regimen and consider the addition of <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Address <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> through non-pharmacological interventions, such as sleep education, relaxation techniques, and establishing a consistent sleep schedule.\n\n6. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Assess the patient's increased alcohol use and provide appropriate interventions to prevent the development of a <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n7. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's well-being.\n\n8. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, and consider involving them in the treatment process to provide a support network.\n\n9. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
