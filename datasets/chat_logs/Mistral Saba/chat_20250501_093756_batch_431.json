      "predicted": "You've shared a lot of difficult feelings and experiences over the past few weeks. It sounds like you've been struggling with a persistent low mood, feeling hopeless and disconnected from activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned feeling irritable, anxious, and constantly on edge. It's clear that you've been having trouble sleeping, both in terms of falling asleep and staying asleep, and you're feeling physically tired. Your relationships feel more distant, and you've been experiencing some physical symptoms like headaches and back pain that you can't quite explain. Additionally, you've mentioned using some substances to cope with these feelings. It's understandable that you're feeling isolated and unsure about your future. <sym>It's important to acknowledge that it takes courage to share these experiences, and I appreciate your openness.</sym>\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with symptoms consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>sad mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym>. The <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as persistent worry, panic sensations, and avoidance behaviors, are prominent and contribute to the overall clinical picture. The patient's use of alcohol and painkillers as coping mechanisms suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> is particularly concerning and requires immediate attention. While the patient reports some <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as headaches and back pain, these do not meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as they are not the primary focus of the patient's distress and do not result in excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors regarding these symptoms. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to warrant a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, considering the significant impairment in functioning and distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> to ensure the patient's safety, given the presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. Given the patient's use of painkillers, a careful consideration of the potential for <sym>substance interactions</sym> is necessary.\n4. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a <med>substance use assessment</med> and consider <med>substance use treatment</med> options, such as <med>motivational interviewing</med> or <med>contingency management</med>.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and support for improving <med>sleep hygiene</med> to address the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed, with a focus on reducing <sym>substance use</sym>, improving mood, and enhancing overall functioning.",
