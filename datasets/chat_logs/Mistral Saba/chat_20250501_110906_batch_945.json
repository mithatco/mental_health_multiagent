This assessment will help us understand your current symptoms and how they might be affecting your daily life. Everything you share will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions and you can answer them to the best of your ability. Let's begin whenever you're ready.

They report significant depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, as well as anxiety and avoidance behaviors. Cognitive difficulties and dissociative symptoms are also present, along with a perception that their symptoms are not taken seriously by others. The patient's behavioral changes, including increased project initiation and risky behaviors, suggest a potential for manic or hypomanic symptoms. Their feelings of detachment and uncertainty about identity and relationships further complicate their clinical picture. The patient's reports of somatic symptoms and their feelings of disconnection from others warrant careful consideration. The presence of suicidal ideation, even without active intent, underscores the need for close monitoring and intervention. Further diagnostic clarification and a thorough mental health assessment are recommended to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

It sounds like you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, both sleeping too much and too little, which can be incredibly taxing. You've also mentioned <sym>irritability</sym> and feeling like you're not yourself at times, which can be quite unsettling. Additionally, you've shared that you've been initiating more projects than usual and engaging in some risky behaviors, which could be a sign of underlying emotional distress. It's also concerning that you've felt <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others, and that you've had <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>. I appreciate your openness about these challenges, and I'm here to help you navigate them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and possible <med>Hypomanic</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> indicate possible <med>Hypomanic</med> features. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> may be related to the underlying <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. The patient's feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym> could be indicative of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> related to severe <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and the patient's clear insight into their condition support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> rather than <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n2. **Medication:** Consider an initial trial of <med>Sertraline</med> or <med>Escitalopram</med> for depression and <med>Buspirone</med> for anxiety, with close monitoring for side effects and effectiveness.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, including their causes, symptoms, and treatment options.\n5. **Suicide Prevention:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, ensure a safety plan is in place and provide resources for crisis intervention.\n6. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
