This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and whether there are any areas we should focus on in more detail. Your answers will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and we can take our time with each one. Let's start whenever you're ready. How have you been feeling lately in terms of interest or pleasure in doing things? Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth.

The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language.",
