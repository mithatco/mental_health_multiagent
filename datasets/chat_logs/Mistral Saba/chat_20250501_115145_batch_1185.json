You've also been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and even some <sym>bodily sensations</sym> like headaches and stomachaches.

Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>severe anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features.

Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation to rule out any medical causes of the <sym>bodily sensations</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and to assess the severity of the <med>Depression</med>, <med>Anxiety</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure the patient's safety. This may include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support resources.\n3. Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address the <med>Depression</med>, <med>Anxiety</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n4. Evaluate the patient for <med>pharmacological treatment</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med>, to manage the <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med> symptoms.\n5. Address the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and, if necessary, <med>medication</med> or <med>therapeutic interventions</med> specifically targeting <med>Insomnia</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and reconnect with friends and family to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. This can be facilitated through group therapy or support groups.\n7.

      "predicted": "I genuinely appreciate your candor and appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with me. It sounds like you've been going through a lot lately, with a persistent lack of interest in things you used to enjoy, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, increased <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. You've also been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and even some <sym>bodily sensations</sym> like headaches and stomachaches. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life and your relationships, causing you to withdraw and feel isolated. It's important to address these concerns to improve your overall well-being and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> for more than half the days in the past two weeks, meeting the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>severe anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are indicative of <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> may be a result of the <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, or they could be a separate <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med> that requires further evaluation. The <sym>bodily sensations</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> are consistent with the <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>, and the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicate a need for a safety assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation to rule out any medical causes of the <sym>bodily sensations</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and to assess the severity of the <med>Depression</med>, <med>Anxiety</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure the patient's safety. This may include identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support resources.\n3. Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address the <med>Depression</med>, <med>Anxiety</med>, and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n4. Evaluate the patient for <med>pharmacological treatment</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med>, to manage the <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med> symptoms.\n5. Address the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> through <med>sleep hygiene</med> education and, if necessary, <med>medication</med> or <med>therapeutic interventions</med> specifically targeting <med>Insomnia</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and reconnect with friends and family to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. This can be facilitated through group therapy or support groups.\n7. Regularly review and adjust the treatment plan based on the patient's progress and feedback to ensure optimal outcomes.",
