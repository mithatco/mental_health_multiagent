This questionnaire will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything we discuss will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer each one based on how much you've been bothered by the symptoms. Let's start with the first question. How much has little interest or pleasure in doing things bothered you over the past two weeks?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ### Clinical Observation Summary\n\n**Patient's Responses Review:**\n\n**1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports feelings of little interest or pleasure in doing things (A1), frequent feelings of depression, hopelessness, and anhedonia (A2).\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences frequent feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge (A6), panic attacks (A7), and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety (A8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient reports insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and nightmares (A4, A14).\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** The patient experiences unexplained aches and pains, including headaches and back pain (A9).\n- **Dissociative Symptoms:** The patient feels detached or distant from self, surroundings, and memories (A18).\n- **Risk of Substance Use:** The patient reports increased alcohol use to aid sleep (A21).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n- The patient's responses indicate a pervasive mood disturbance characterized by depression and anxiety.\n- There is a clear pattern of avoidance behaviors and safety-seeking strategies, likely stemming from post-traumatic stress.\n- The patient's symptoms are consistent with a history of trauma, specifically related to a recent accident.\n- The patient's sleep disturbances are both a symptom and a concern, with increased alcohol use as a coping mechanism.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** The patient's symptoms of avoidance, intrusive memories, and hyperarousal (A6, A7, A8, A16) suggest a possible PTSD diagnosis.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** The patient's reports of persistent depression, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness indicate a depressive episode (A1, A2, A10).\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** The patient's persistent feelings of anxiety and worry (A6) may suggest GAD.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** The patient's unexplained physical symptoms (A9) may indicate a somatic symptom disorder.\n- **Substance Use:** Increased alcohol use to manage sleep (A21) is a concerning behavior that could lead to further substance use disorders.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Although the patient denies suicidal thoughts (A11), the presence of depressive symptoms and substance use is a risk factor for suicide.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient's increased alcohol consumption to manage sleep is a risk factor for developing a substance use disorder.\n- **Trauma History:** The patient's history of trauma (accident) is a significant risk factor for PTSD and other mental health issues.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with multiple mental health diagnoses, including potential PTSD, MDD, GAD, and somatic symptom disorder. The patient's history of trauma, depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and increased alcohol use for sleep management highlight significant clinical concerns. The patient's avoidance behaviors and dissociation suggest a need for targeted interventions to address trauma and anxiety. Continued monitoring for suicidal ideation and substance use is necessary to ensure patient safety and prevent further deterioration. A comprehensive treatment plan should address these concerns through a combination of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and monitoring of substance use.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through an incredibly challenging time since your accident. You've described feeling a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and a constant state of anxiety and fear. The <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>intrusive memories</sym> you've experienced are understandably overwhelming, and it's understandable that you've been avoiding situations that trigger these feelings. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> further compound your struggles, and it's commendable that you're seeking help. Your increased alcohol use to manage sleep is a concerning behavior, and it's important to address this.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Probable <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> with concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient's history of trauma (accident), <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>. The persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, point to a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's increased alcohol use to manage <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> suggests a developing <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could be related to the <med>PTSD</med> or <med>MDD</med>, and further evaluation is needed to determine if they warrant a separate diagnosis.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Trauma-Focused Therapy:** Refer the patient to a therapist specialized in <med>trauma-focused therapy</med>, such as <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure Therapy</med>, to address the <sym>PTSD</sym> symptoms.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend <med>CBT</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, focusing on <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> and <sym>behavioral avoidance</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for medication management, which may include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> for both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>, and possible <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term <sym>anxiety management</sym>. Monitor alcohol use and consider <med>naltrexone</med> or <med>acamprosate</med> for <sym>alcohol cravings</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce reliance on <sym>alcohol</sym> for sleep.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, address any emerging <sym>substance use</sym> concerns, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. **Support Groups:** Consider recommending support groups for <sym>trauma survivors</sym> and <sym>mental health</sym> challenges to provide additional emotional support and resources.",
