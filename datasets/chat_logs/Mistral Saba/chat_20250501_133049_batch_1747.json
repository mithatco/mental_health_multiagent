This assessment is designed to help us understand how you've been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I'll read each question to you. Let's begin whenever you're ready."

Like the other day, my coworker asked me something and I just snapped at them. I felt bad afterward, but it was like I couldn't control it."

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Anhedonia: Patient reports a significant decrease in interest or pleasure in activities (Q2).\n- Depressed mood: Recurrent feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless (Q3).\n- Irritability: Increased irritability and anger, difficulty controlling temper (Q4).\n- Sleep disturbance: Insomnia and nightmares related to a traumatic event (Q5, Q15).\n- Anxiety: Persistent feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge (Q7).\n- Panic attacks: Experiences of panic, racing heart, and difficulty breathing (Q8).\n- Avoidance behaviors: Avoids situations and activities that remind of the accident (Q9).\n- Somatic symptoms: Unexplained aches and pains, stomach discomfort (Q10).\n- Intrusive thoughts: Recurrent, unwanted thoughts related to the accident (Q17).\n- Dissociation: Feels detached from self and surroundings at times (Q19).\n- Interpersonal difficulties: Feels detached from others, avoids social activities (Q21).\n- Alcohol use: Reports drinking 3-4 drinks of alcohol nightly to aid sleep (Q22).\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- The patient's symptoms are highly interconnected and appear to stem from a recent accident.\n- There is a pattern of avoidance and detachment in both behavioral and interpersonal domains.\n- Sleep disturbance and anxiety seem to be central to the patient's presentation.\n- The patient reports a lack of enjoyment and motivation, indicative of a more pervasive mood disturbance.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Given the patient's history of a traumatic event (the accident), symptoms of re-experiencing (Q17), avoidance (Q9), and hyperarousal (Q7, Q8) suggest a PTSD diagnosis may be warranted.\n- Major Depressive Disorder: Symptoms of anhedonia (Q2), depressed mood (Q3), and sleep disturbance (Q15) indicate a possible depressive disorder.\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Persistent anxiety and avoidance behaviors (Q7, Q9) suggest a potential GAD diagnosis.\n- Alcohol Use Disorder: Nightly alcohol use to aid sleep may indicate a pattern of problematic drinking.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- The patient denies current suicidal ideation (Q12), but the presence of depressed mood, anhedonia, and avoidance behaviors warrants continued monitoring for suicidal risk.\n- Alcohol use as a coping mechanism could escalate and lead to further substance use disorders.\n- The patient's detachment from others and avoidance of social activities could contribute to feelings of isolation and exacerbate other symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with PTSD, including intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal. Depressive and anxiety symptoms are also prominent, with significant sleep disturbance and anhedonia. The patient's alcohol use to aid sleep may indicate a developing substance use disorder. Interpersonally, the patient experiences detachment and avoids social activities. The patient denies current suicidal ideation but should be monitored for changes in mood and behavior. The patient's symptoms appear to be interconnected and stem from a recent traumatic event, highlighting the need for a comprehensive trauma-informed approach to treatment.",
