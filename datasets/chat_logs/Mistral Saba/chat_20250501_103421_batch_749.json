      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a very challenging time. The persistent <sym>feeling of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, and the <sym>irritability</sym> have been significantly impacting your life. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic symptoms</sym> you're experiencing, along with the <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> and <sym>increased alcohol use</sym>, indicate that you're coping with a lot right now. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to a past accident suggest that there might be some unresolved trauma. It's understandable that you're feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of physical discomfort as well.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>) and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to a past accident, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>feeling detached from oneself and others</sym> are indicative of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, the <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> suggest a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The increased alcohol use may be a maladaptive coping mechanism for dealing with these <sym>symptoms</sym>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could be a manifestation of psychological distress. Given the severity and duration of these <sym>symptoms</sym>, a provisional diagnosis is warranted.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Mental Health Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough assessment to validate the provisional diagnoses and rule out other possible conditions.\n2. **Trauma-Focused Therapy:** Implement evidence-based therapies such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing</med> (<med>EMDR</med>) to address the <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. **Antidepressant Medication:** Consider prescribing <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) to manage <med>MDD</med> symptoms, if indicated.\n4. **Alcohol Use Assessment:** Evaluate the extent of alcohol use and provide appropriate intervention or referral for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> treatment if necessary.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene:** Develop a sleep hygiene plan to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue.\n6. **Support Network:** Encourage engagement with social support systems and consider <med>group therapy</med> to address feelings of disconnection.\n7. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure safety.",
