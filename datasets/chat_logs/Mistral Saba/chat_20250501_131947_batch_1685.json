      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really challenging time, both emotionally and physically. You've expressed feeling a profound loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, persistent sadness and hopelessness, and a lack of energy that makes even everyday tasks feel overwhelming. Your sleep has been disrupted, with early morning awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, leaving you chronically fatigued. Anxiety and worry have become constant companions, and you've started to avoid social situations to cope. You've mentioned <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even if it hasn't been acted upon, which is deeply concerning. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>uneasy physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain, and a sense of detachment from yourself and your surroundings. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have taken a toll on your overall well-being and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation aligns strongly with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The core <sym>symptoms</sym> include <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>. The patient reports <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is a significant indicator of the severity of the depression. The absence of <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> rules out <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidant behaviors</sym> could be indicative of co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, but the prominent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and their impact on the patient's functioning suggest <med>MDD</med> as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and improve coping mechanisms.\n\n2. **Medication Management**: Consultation with a psychiatrist for potential <med>antidepressant medication</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants before bedtime.\n\n4. **Suicide Prevention**: Implement a safety plan and ensure the patient has a support system in place to manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. This may include regular follow-ups and crisis intervention resources.\n\n5. **Medical Evaluation**: Refer the patient for a comprehensive medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n\n6. **Social Support**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with friends and family, or join support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.\n\n7. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, treatment efficacy, and overall well-being. Adjust the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's response.",
