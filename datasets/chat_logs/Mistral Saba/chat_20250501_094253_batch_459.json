However, the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety warrant ongoing monitoring for any changes in suicidal ideation.\n- **Avoidance Behaviors**: The patient's avoidance of social situations and potential isolation could exacerbate depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n- **Sleep Patterns**: Excessive sleep and difficulty getting out of bed could be a sign of underlying depression or a coping mechanism for anxiety.\n\n#### Summary\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and potential Social Anxiety Disorder. The patient's avoidance behaviors, sleep disturbances, and feelings of disconnection and identity confusion are clinically significant and warrant further exploration. There are no immediate risk factors for suicidal behavior, but ongoing monitoring is necessary. The patient's responses indicate a need for comprehensive assessment and treatment focused on managing depressive and anxiety symptoms, addressing avoidance behaviors, and fostering a sense of identity and connection.",
