Consider <med>anxiolytic</med> medication for short-term use during <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n3. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>homicidal ideation</sym>, given the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate yourself and your support system about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> to better understand and manage your symptoms.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Encourage regular <sym>sleep hygiene</sym>, <sym>exercise</sym>, and <sym>stress management</sym> techniques to improve overall well-being and <sym>mood stability</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly review and adjust treatment plan as needed, based on symptom progression and treatment response.\n7. **Substance Use Monitoring:** Continue to monitor for any signs of <med>Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders</med>, given your history of bad experiences with recreational drugs.\n8. **Relationship Building:** Work on <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym> through <med>psychotherapy</med> to improve <sym>social functioning</sym> and <sym>quality of life</sym>.",

      "predicted": "It's evident that you've been navigating a challenging time. You've shared that you've been feeling a profound <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, accompanied by persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. This emotional turmoil has been exacerbated by <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>difficulty controlling your temper</sym>, which can be incredibly frustrating. You've also described fluctuating <sym>sleep patterns</sym>, with periods of both <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>, and a constant underlying <sym>anxiety</sym> that often escalates into <sym>panic</sym>. It's clear that these experiences have led to some <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, making it difficult for you to engage in social situations or even leave your home at times. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>struggles with identity</sym> and <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym>, which further compounds your distress. It's important to acknowledge that you've been feeling these emotions for some time, and it's commendable that you're seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, Type II, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with <sym>panic attacks</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your report of both <sym>depressive episodes</sym> and <sym>hypomanic periods</sym> aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> Type II. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> that is disproportionate to situational triggers and the occurrence of <sym>panic attacks</sym> further supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with <sym>panic attacks</sym>. The absence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym> and your ability to function in daily life suggest that these are not <med>psychotic features</med>. Additionally, the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are consistent with these diagnoses. While <med>Borderline Personality Disorder</med> could be considered due to <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and <sym>identity struggles</med>, the absence of <sym>impulsivity</sym> and <sym>unstable relationships</sym> makes it less likely at this time. The <sym>occasional derealization</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> experiences are not frequent or severe enough to warrant a separate diagnosis of a <med>Dissociative Disorder</med>. It is also important to note that you do not meet the criteria for <med>Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders</med> as you report no current substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Begin with <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy</med> (<med>IPSRT</med>) to stabilize mood and improve daily routines.\n2. **Medication Management:** Collaborate with a psychiatrist to find the appropriate <med>mood stabilizer</med> and <med>antidepressant</med> to manage <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> symptoms. Consider <med>anxiolytic</med> medication for short-term use during <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n3. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>homicidal ideation</sym>, given the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate yourself and your support system about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> to better understand and manage your symptoms.\n5. **Lifestyle Changes:** Encourage regular <sym>sleep hygiene</sym>, <sym>exercise</sym>, and <sym>stress management</sym> techniques to improve overall well-being and <sym>mood stability</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring:** Regularly review and adjust treatment plan as needed, based on symptom progression and treatment response.\n7. **Substance Use Monitoring:** Continue to monitor for any signs of <med>Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders</med>, given your history of bad experiences with recreational drugs.\n8. **Relationship Building:** Work on <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym> through <med>psychotherapy</med> to improve <sym>social functioning</sym> and <sym>quality of life</sym>.",
