Your answers will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We will be going through 23 questions to cover various aspects of your mental health.

There is a notable lack of interest in previously enjoyable activities and a sense of hopelessness, along with a withdrawal from social interactions.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Mood Disorder:** The presence of anhedonia, depressed mood, and hopelessness suggests a depressive disorder.\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms of generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors are indicative of an anxiety disorder.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** The patient's report of unexplained aches and pains, along with feeling that physical symptoms are not taken seriously, may suggest a somatic symptom disorder.\n- **Dissociative Symptoms:** Feelings of detachment or depersonalization are notable.\n- **Social Withdrawal:** Indicative of potential avoidance behaviors related to anxiety or depressive symptoms.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports having thoughts of harming themselves, though no immediate action has been taken.\n- **Panic Attacks:** The occurrence of panic attacks suggests a high level of anxiety and potential for further exacerbation of symptoms.\n- **Dependence on Health Care Providers:** The feeling that medical concerns are not being taken seriously could lead to non-adherence or mistrust in treatment.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and potential somatic symptom disorder. The patient experiences anhedonia, depressed mood, hopelessness, and panic attacks, along with somatic symptoms and a sense of detachment. There is a notable pattern of social withdrawal and a history of suicidal ideation, which warrants careful monitoring and intervention. The patient's feelings of being unheard regarding medical concerns and the presence of panic attacks highlight areas that require immediate attention.

It sounds like you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and a notable lack of <sym>interest or pleasure</sym> in your daily activities. The <sym>anxiety</sym> you've been feeling seems to be quite pervasive, with frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors. Additionally, you've been dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your daily life and relationships.\n\n***Diagnosis:** Depressive Disorder, Severe, Recurrent, With Anxious Features and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>*\n\n***Reasoning:** The patient presents with a constellation of <sym>symptoms</sym> that align with a <med>Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors suggests <med>Anxious Features</med>. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> aligns with <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The patient's feelings of being unheard regarding medical concerns and <sym>depersonalization</sym> further support this diagnosis. The severity and recurrence of <sym>symptoms</sym> warrant a diagnosis of <med>Severe, Recurrent</med> <med>Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> <sym>symptoms</sym>. CBT can help the patient manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</med>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be considered.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. This may include a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding <sym>stimulants</sym> close to bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n4. **Somatic Symptom Management:** Educate the patient about <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and provide strategies to manage <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>. This may include relaxation techniques, <med>mindfulness</med>, and <med>stress management</med> strategies.\n5. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Given the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, conduct a thorough <med>suicide risk assessment</med> and develop a safety plan. Ensure the patient has a support system in place and is aware of resources available in case of a crisis.",
