      "predicted": "I understand that you've been struggling with a significant loss of interest and pleasure in activities, persistent feelings of depression, and a sense of hopelessness and emptiness. You've mentioned that you feel down a lot, and even small things seem to bother you more than usual. It sounds like you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> as well, with constant worries and fears about the future. You've also shared that you've been sleeping a lot but still feeling tired, and you're having trouble with memory and concentration. These <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym> are causing you to feel like you're not thinking clearly, and you've even mentioned feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings at times. You've been withdrawing from social interactions and feeling like a burden to others. It's understandable that these experiences have been challenging, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation aligns closely with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>). The presence of <sym>persistent depressive mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>decreased energy</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> supports this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry and <sym>cognitive disintegration</sym>, are also present. The patient's <sym>sleep pattern</sym> is disrupted, with <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and persistent <sym>fatigue</sym>. Social withdrawal and feelings of worthlessness are notable, and there is a subjective sense of cognitive impairment. These symptoms significantly impact the patient's daily functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient address depressive thoughts and improve coping strategies.\n2. **Pharmacological Treatment:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressant medication</med> such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulating activities before bedtime.\n4. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Implement <med>cognitive rehabilitation</med> techniques to address <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>cognitive disintegration</sym>.\n5. **Social Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and connect with supportive individuals to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of isolation.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
