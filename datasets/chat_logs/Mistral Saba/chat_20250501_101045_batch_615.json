Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n   - The patient reports a pervasive negative mood and loss of interest, accompanied by anxiety and sleep disturbances.\n   - There is a pattern of cognitive and affective symptoms without significant psychotic features (e.g., no hallucinations, delusions).\n   - The patient exhibits a pattern of avoidance and withdrawal in social and interpersonal contexts.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Depressive Symptoms:** Persistent anhedonia, hopelessness, and difficulty finding motivation.\n   - **Anxiety Symptoms:** Constant anxiety, avoidance of situations due to anxiety, and feelings of detachment.\n   - **Sleep Disturbances:** Insomnia and variable sleep quality.\n   - **Cognitive and Identity Issues:** Feelings of uncertainty about personal identity and life goals.\n   - **Interpersonal Relationships:** Withdrawal from social interactions and difficulties in maintaining close relationships.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Fleeting thoughts of self-harm, though not acting on them (Q11).\n   - **Generalized Anxiety:** Constant anxiety and an inability to relax (Q6).\n\n**5. Summary:**\n   The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder, characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, and a pervasive negative mood. Anxiety symptoms, including constant nervousness, avoidance, and feelings of detachment, are also prominent. Sleep disturbances and interpersonal difficulties are notable, as is a sense of uncertainty about personal identity and life goals. The patient has not endorsed any psychotic symptoms or substance use. The presence of suicidal ideation, though fleeting, warrants further exploration and safety assessment. The clinical picture suggests a need for further evaluation and potential treatment for a depressive and anxiety disorder, with an emphasis on safety and support for interpersonal relationships.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been feeling incredibly overwhelmed and disconnected from the things that used to bring you joy. You've been experiencing persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which has made it hard for you to find motivation and relaxation. Sleep has been inconsistent, and you've felt detached from yourself and others. These feelings have led to some <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even if it's only fleeting. It's understandable that these experiences have made you feel isolated and misunderstood, as if people around you don't truly grasp the depth of your struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and possible <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive slowing</sym> and <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym>. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym>, which are common comorbid conditions with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> or <sym>substance use</sym> supports the primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is a significant concern that warrants immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate the patient's risk of self-harm and develop an appropriate safety plan.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address the <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms and improve coping skills.\n3. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), to manage the <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep hygiene</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n5. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive relationships and consider supportive therapy or group therapy to address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
