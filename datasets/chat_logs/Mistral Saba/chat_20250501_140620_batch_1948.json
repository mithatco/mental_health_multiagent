You've mentioned feeling depressed and hopeless, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, and experiencing a lot of worry and anxiety. It's clear that you're not feeling like yourself, and that's been affecting your sleep, your relationships, and your overall well-being. It's also important to acknowledge the physical symptoms you've been experiencing, such as headaches and stomach issues. It's commendable that you're taking your prescribed medication as directed. Let's explore these feelings and find some ways to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with <med>Anxiety</med> features and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, indicates <med>Anxiety</med> features. Additionally, the patient's fluctuating <sym>sleep pattern</sym> warrants an evaluation for a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>feeling detached</quote> and <quote>lost</quote> may also suggest an existential component to their distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1.

Consider a referral to <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as to develop coping strategies for <sym>sleep</sym> disturbances and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n3. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> regularly, given the patient's current <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent <sym>sleep</sym> schedule and practice good <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> to help regulate their <sym>sleep pattern</sym>.\n5.

Encourage the patient to engage in gentle <med>exercise</med> and <med>self-care</med> activities to help improve their <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>overall well-being</sym>.\n7.

Additionally, the patient exhibits significant anxiety symptoms, characterized by persistent worry, nervousness, and avoidance behaviors. Somatic complaints, including headaches and stomach issues, may be related to psychological stress. The patient also reports feelings of detachment, existential distress, and social isolation. These symptoms collectively suggest a complex presentation of mood and anxiety disorders, warranting comprehensive assessment and treatment planning. Regular monitoring for suicidal ideation and risk factors is essential given the patient's current emotional state.",

You've mentioned feeling depressed and hopeless, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, and experiencing a lot of worry and anxiety. It's clear that you're not feeling like yourself, and that's been affecting your sleep, your relationships, and your overall well-being. It's also important to acknowledge the physical symptoms you've been experiencing, such as headaches and stomach issues. It's commendable that you're taking your prescribed medication as directed. Let's explore these feelings and find some ways to help you feel better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with <med>Anxiety</med> features and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, indicates <med>Anxiety</med> features. Additionally, the patient's fluctuating <sym>sleep pattern</sym> warrants an evaluation for a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>feeling detached</quote> and <quote>lost</quote> may also suggest an existential component to their distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n2. Consider a referral to <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as to develop coping strategies for <sym>sleep</sym> disturbances and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n3. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> regularly, given the patient's current <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to maintain a consistent <sym>sleep</sym> schedule and practice good <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> to help regulate their <sym>sleep pattern</sym>.\n5. Consider a referral to a <med>primary care physician</med> for a thorough medical evaluation to assess <sym>somatic</sym> complaints, such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach issues</sym>, and to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in gentle <med>exercise</med> and <med>self-care</med> activities to help improve their <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>overall well-being</sym>.\n7. Foster a supportive and non-judgmental environment to encourage the patient to express their feelings and concerns openly.\n8. Regularly review and adjust the patient's <med>medication</med> regimen as needed, in consultation with their <med>prescribing physician</med>.",
