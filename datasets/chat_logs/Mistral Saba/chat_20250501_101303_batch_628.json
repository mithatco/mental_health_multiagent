      "predicted": "I appreciate you sharing your experiences and how you've been feeling. It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time, with a noticeable decrease in interest in activities you used to enjoy, feelings of depression, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. It's clear that you've been feeling overwhelmed, and it's understandable that you might feel misunderstood or disconnected from others. It's also concerning that you've been using substances to cope, including alcohol and painkillers, which might be a sign that you need additional support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Provisional Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, which are core <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's increased irritability and feelings of being on edge could be indicative of <sym>anxiety</sym>, which often co-occurs with <med>MDD</med>. The patient's report of excessive alcohol use and misuse of prescribed painkillers suggests a possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, given the criteria outlined in the DSM-5, which includes <sym>using substances in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended</sym> and <sym>persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use</sym>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym> are also consistent with <med>MDD</med>. While the symptoms do not fully meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis of <med>Substance-Induced Mood Disorder</med> or <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, the pattern of use is concerning and warrants further assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management**: Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and potential pharmacotherapy, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> for <med>MDD</med>.\n3. **Substance Use Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's <med>substance use</med> to determine the severity and appropriate level of care.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n5. **Support System Engagement**: Encourage the patient to reconnect with supportive friends and family to improve social connections and reduce <sym>isolation</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.\n7. **Psychoeducation**: Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> to help them understand their conditions and the importance of treatment adherence.",
