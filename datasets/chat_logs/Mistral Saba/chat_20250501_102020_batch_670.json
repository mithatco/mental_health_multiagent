You've described feeling depressed and hopeless most days, and you've mentioned increased irritability and anxiety. It sounds like you've been sleeping a lot but still feel exhausted, and you've withdrawn from social activities and friends. You've also experienced some physical discomforts, like headaches and stomachaches, and feel detached from yourself and your surroundings at times. It's clear that you've been struggling, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n****Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent loss of interest and pleasure in activities (anhedonia), which is a key symptom of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and depression</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>. The constellation of these symptoms, lasting over two weeks and causing significant distress or impairment, aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the <med>DSM-5</med>. The patient denies psychotic features, which supports a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> rather than <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. While <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is also present, the primary focus of the patient's distress is on depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Continue monitoring for any suicidal ideation, as the patient denies current thoughts but experiences significant <sym>hopelessness</sym>.\n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of <med>MDD</med>.\n3. Consider initiating <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based psychotherapies to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n4. Explore the possibility of medication management, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n5. Encourage gradual re-engagement in social activities and self-care practices to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.\n6. Monitor for any potential <med>substance use</med> issues, given the patient's avoidance of alcohol, and encourage healthy coping strategies.\n7. Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> and its treatment options to empower them in their recovery journey.",

There is a notable absence of psychotic or manic symptoms. The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal suggest a further decline in functioning. The co-occurrence of somatic symptoms and cognitive impairments adds to the complexity of the presentation. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the specific diagnoses and develop an appropriate intervention plan.",

      "predicted": "You've shared that you've been feeling quite down lately, with a notable loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've described feeling depressed and hopeless most days, and you've mentioned increased irritability and anxiety. It sounds like you've been sleeping a lot but still feel exhausted, and you've withdrawn from social activities and friends. You've also experienced some physical discomforts, like headaches and stomachaches, and feel detached from yourself and your surroundings at times. It's clear that you've been struggling, and I'm here to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n****Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent loss of interest and pleasure in activities (anhedonia), which is a key symptom of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and depression</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>. The constellation of these symptoms, lasting over two weeks and causing significant distress or impairment, aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the <med>DSM-5</med>. The patient denies psychotic features, which supports a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> rather than <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. While <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> is also present, the primary focus of the patient's distress is on depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Continue monitoring for any suicidal ideation, as the patient denies current thoughts but experiences significant <sym>hopelessness</sym>.\n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of <med>MDD</med>.\n3. Consider initiating <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based psychotherapies to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n4. Explore the possibility of medication management, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n5. Encourage gradual re-engagement in social activities and self-care practices to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>.\n6. Monitor for any potential <med>substance use</med> issues, given the patient's avoidance of alcohol, and encourage healthy coping strategies.\n7. Educate the patient about <med>MDD</med> and its treatment options to empower them in their recovery journey.",
