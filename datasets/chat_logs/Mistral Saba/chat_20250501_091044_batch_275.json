      "predicted": "I want to acknowledge the struggles you've been facing. It sounds like you've been feeling overwhelmed by a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> more often than usual, and that <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> have been affecting your quality of life. It's also concerning to hear about your <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, even if they're not active plans, and the <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> of detachment you've been experiencing. It's clear that these <symptoms> are impacting your daily life and relationships, and it's important to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, likely with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and possible Panic Disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for the past two weeks, along with <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>insomnia</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. These symptoms meet the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which suggest a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> reported, such as feeling detached from oneself and surroundings, warrant further exploration but are not sufficient to diagnosis a <med>Dissociative Disorder</med> at this time. The patient's <sym>cognitive issues</sym>, such as <sym>memory problems</sym>, could be related to <sym>stress</sym> or <sym>depression</sym>. The patient does not meet the criteria for <med>Somatoform Disorder</med> as the <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> are likely secondary to <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. The patient does not report <sym>substance use</sym> or <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, ruling out <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> and <med>Psychotic Disorder</med> as primary concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Discuss the possibility of medication with the patient, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> to help them understand their experiences and reduce stigma.\n5. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety. Develop a safety plan if necessary.\n6. **Referral:** Consider referring the patient to a neurologist or other specialist to rule out any underlying <med>medical conditions</med> that may be contributing to <sym>cognitive issues</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n7. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and build a support network to combat feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>.\n8. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
