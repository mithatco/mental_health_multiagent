      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing a range of significant <sym>symptoms</sym> that have been causing you considerable distress. You've shared feelings of profound sadness, a loss of pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, <sym>irritability</sym>, and a persistent sense of hopelessness. Your <sym>sleep</sym> has been disrupted, and you've been feeling physically unwell, with <sym>aches and pains</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> that seem to have no clear cause. Additionally, you've been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, often feeling on edge or even panicked. You've also mentioned feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and having intrusive thoughts about your future. It's understandable that these experiences have been overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're seeking support. Rest assured, I am here to help you navigate through this challenging time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety features and Somatic Symptom Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation is consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> based on the presence of multiple <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>fatigue</med>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as excessive worry, panic, and avoidance behaviors. This is evident in the patient's report of feeling nervous, anxious, and frightened often, as well as avoiding situations that make them anxious. The patient also reports <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> such as unexplained aches and pains, which could be indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (SSD), given the distress and impairment caused by these symptoms. The patient's feelings of disconnection from oneself and others, along with intrusive thoughts, further support a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> with anxiety features. The patient's thoughts of self-harm, although not currently acted upon, are a significant concern and warrant close monitoring. The patient's overall presentation suggests a complex interplay of <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, requiring a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based talk therapy to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consideration of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. A consultation with a psychiatrist may be beneficial.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implementing good <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> practices to improve sleep quality and duration.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Incorporating mindfulness practices and relaxation techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Addressing the patient's feelings of disconnection and withdrawal from social interactions.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n7. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address any thoughts of self-harm, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n8. **Cultural Considerations:** Consider the patient's cultural background and how it may impact their experience of <med>MDD</med> and <med>SSD</med>, and tailor treatment accordingly.",
