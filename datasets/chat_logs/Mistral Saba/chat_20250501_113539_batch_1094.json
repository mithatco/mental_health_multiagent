This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Safety Planning:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of isolation.\n6. **Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptom severity and treatment response.",

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed recently. You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy, such as gardening, and you've been feeling down and depressed most days. You've mentioned that you're experiencing <sym>insomnia</sym>, waking up early and having trouble falling back asleep, and you've been feeling more irritable and snapping at people over small things. You've also expressed <sym>anxiety</sym>, feeling nervous and on edge, and sometimes panicking in crowded places. You've been experiencing <sym>physical pain</sym>, including headaches and backaches, and you've mentioned feeling detached from yourself and others, as well as having <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like memory problems. It's also concerning that you've had thoughts of hurting yourself, though you've mentioned you don't have any specific plans.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure in activities</sym> (<sym>anhedonia</sym>), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym> (irritability and restlessness) is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (DSM-5). Additionally, the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although without specific plans, is a concerning symptom that warrants immediate attention. The patient's symptoms are not better explained by another <med>mental disorder</med>, such as <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> or <med>Schizoaffective Disorder</med>, and they persist for more than two weeks, meeting the duration requirement for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend evidence-based therapies such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation and possible <med>pharmacological treatment</med>. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SSRIs) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (SNRIs) are commonly used to treat <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>insomnia</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n4. **Safety Planning:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n5. **Support System:** Encourage the patient to reach out to friends, family, or support groups to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of isolation.\n6. **Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptom severity and treatment response.",
