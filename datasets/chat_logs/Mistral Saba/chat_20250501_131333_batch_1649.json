For example, when asking about sleep disturbances, the therapist could have been more specific about the types of sleep problems (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia) to better align with DSM-5 terminology.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and maintained a coherent conversational arc. For instance, after the patient disclosed their excessive use of prescription painkillers, the therapist appropriately discussed potential risks and the need for a medication review.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly linked specific patient symptoms to DSM-5 criteria, ensuring a comprehensive differential diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation of the patient's feelings."
