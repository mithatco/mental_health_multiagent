This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Your answers will be kept confidential, and this will help us create a safe space for discussion. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this process comfortable for you. Let's start with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Co-occurring anxiety and significant sleep disturbances are also present. The patient's interpersonal relationships are affected by mood fluctuations, with withdrawal during depression and superficial interactions during mania.

      "predicted": "It's clear from our discussion that you've been experiencing significant fluctuations in your mood and energy levels, which have been causing you a lot of distress. You mentioned feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> at times, with little interest in activities you used to enjoy. You also described periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym> and <sym>increased energy</sym>, during which you start multiple projects but struggle to complete them. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>, as well as <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> during depressive episodes. It's also apparent that these mood swings have affected your relationships, with <sym>withdrawal</sym> during depression and <sym>superficial social interactions</sym> during mania. It's understandable that these experiences would be overwhelming, and I'm here to help you manage them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a clear pattern of <sym>mood fluctuations</sym> consistent with <med>bipolar disorder</med>, characterized by both <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>manic</sym> episodes. The <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> during depressive episodes, along with <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> during manic episodes, strongly suggest this diagnosis. Additionally, the co-occurring <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are common in <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>interpersonal</sym> and <sym>behavioral</sym> patterns further support this diagnosis, as <sym>mood</sym> fluctuations often impact relationships and behavior.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>mood stabilizers</med>, <med>antidepressants</med>, or <med>antipsychotics</med> to manage <sym>bipolar disorder</sym> symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to develop coping strategies for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address <sym>interpersonal</sym> issues.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>quality of life</sym>.\n4. **Support System:** Connect with support groups or trusted individuals to share experiences and gain <sym>social support</sym>.\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule regular check-ins with a mental health professional to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.",
