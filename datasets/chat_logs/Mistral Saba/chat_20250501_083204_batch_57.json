It sounds like you've been going through significant highs and lows, with periods where you feel incredibly down and hopeless, and other times where you're bursting with energy and excitement. These shifts can be exhausting and confusing, and it's understandable that you've felt frustrated when healthcare providers haven't fully understood or addressed these fluctuations. It's also clear that you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to seek help and navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic, Severe\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on the patient's report of distinct periods of elevated mood with increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and grandiosity, followed by periods of depressed mood with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, hopelessness, and increased sleep, the diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> is warranted. The patient's description of <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with the criteria for this disorder. The patient's history of <med>treatment non-adherence</med> with antidepressants, which exacerbated <sym>mood instability</sym>, further supports this diagnosis. The absence of <med>psychotic features</med> or <med>substance-induced mood disorder</med> criteria suggests that Bipolar I Disorder is the most fitting diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consider consultation with a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner for pharmacologic treatment. Mood stabilizers like lithium or anticonvulsants (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine) and atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine) are often used to manage <med>bipolar disorder</med>. Close monitoring for side effects and adherence is crucial.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help the patient manage <sym>mood swings</sym>, develop coping strategies, and improve overall functioning.\n3. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Encourage regular sleep hygiene, a balanced diet, and regular exercise to help stabilize <sym>mood</sym> and energy levels. Education about the role of lifestyle factors in managing <med>bipolar disorder</med> is essential.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>bipolar disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system understand the condition, recognize early warning signs, and develop a safety plan for <sym>manic</sym> and depressive episodes.\n5. **Substance Use Screening:** Conduct a thorough assessment of any potential <med>substance use disorder</med> or self-medication patterns, as these can exacerbate <med>bipolar symptoms</med>. Provide support and resources as needed.\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety planning, given the patient's history of passive suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes.\n7. **Follow-up and Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> fluctuations, medication effectiveness, and adherence. Collaborate with the patient's support system to ensure consistent care.",

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - **Mood Instability:** The patient reports periods of depression with anhedonia, hopelessness, and irritability, alternating with manic phases characterized by increased energy, irritability, decreased need for sleep, and impulsivity.\n   - **Sleep Disturbances:** Marked changes in sleep patterns, with both insomnia and hypersomnia, depending on the mood phase.\n   - **Anxiety:** Anxiety is prominent during depressive episodes, with worries about the future and panic attacks, but not during manic phases.\n   - **Identity and Relationship Difficulties:** Feelings of disconnection from oneself and others during depressive episodes, and a sense of grandiosity and impulsivity during manic episodes.\n   - **Somatic Symptoms:** No significant unexplained aches or pains.\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n   - **Bipolar Pattern:** The patient exhibits a clear pattern of alternating depressive and manic episodes, with distinct periods of each.\n   - **Impulsivity and Risk-Taking:** Increased impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors during manic phases.\n   - **Anhedonia and Apathy:** During depressive episodes, the patient experiences a lack of interest in activities and feelings of hopelessness.\n   - **Sleep Changes:** Sleep patterns fluctuate significantly between manic and depressive episodes.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Bipolar Disorder:** The patient's description of mood swings, energy levels, and sleep patterns is consistent with Bipolar I Disorder.\n   - **Treatment Non-Adherence:** The patient has discontinued antidepressant medication, which may contribute to mood instability.\n   - **Substance Use:** Although the patient denies current substance use, past experiences with medication side effects and potential self-medication should be explored.\n   - **Risk of Suicidal Ideation:** Although the patient reports passive suicidal ideation, the risk is not currently active but should be monitored.\n\n**4. Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient has had passive suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes.\n   - **Impulsivity:** Increased impulsivity during manic phases could lead to risky behaviors.\n   - **Non-Adherence to Medication:** Discontinuation of antidepressant medication may exacerbate symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\n   The patient presents with a classic pattern of Bipolar I Disorder, characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. Manic episodes are marked by increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. Depressive episodes are characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. The patient's history of treatment non-adherence and passive suicidal ideation necessitates ongoing monitoring and a comprehensive treatment plan. Further exploration of the patient's experiences with medication and potential self-medication is essential. The patient's reports of anxiety, impulsivity, and mood instability suggest a need for consistent and potentially intensive treatment to manage symptoms and prevent potential risks.",

It sounds like you've been going through significant highs and lows, with periods where you feel incredibly down and hopeless, and other times where you're bursting with energy and excitement. These shifts can be exhausting and confusing, and it's understandable that you've felt frustrated when healthcare providers haven't fully understood or addressed these fluctuations. It's also clear that you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to seek help and navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic, Severe\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on the patient's report of distinct periods of elevated mood with increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and grandiosity, followed by periods of depressed mood with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, hopelessness, and increased sleep, the diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> is warranted. The patient's description of <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with the criteria for this disorder. The patient's history of <med>treatment non-adherence</med> with antidepressants, which exacerbated <sym>mood instability</sym>, further supports this diagnosis. The absence of <med>psychotic features</med> or <med>substance-induced mood disorder</med> criteria suggests that Bipolar I Disorder is the most fitting diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Management:** Consider consultation with a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner for pharmacologic treatment. Mood stabilizers like lithium or anticonvulsants (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine) and atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine) are often used to manage <med>bipolar disorder</med>. Close monitoring for side effects and adherence is crucial.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help the patient manage <sym>mood swings</sym>, develop coping strategies, and improve overall functioning.\n3. **Lifestyle Interventions:** Encourage regular sleep hygiene, a balanced diet, and regular exercise to help stabilize <sym>mood</sym> and energy levels. Education about the role of lifestyle factors in managing <med>bipolar disorder</med> is essential.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>bipolar disorder</med> to help the patient and their support system understand the condition, recognize early warning signs, and develop a safety plan for <sym>manic</sym> and depressive episodes.\n5. **Substance Use Screening:** Conduct a thorough assessment of any potential <med>substance use disorder</med> or self-medication patterns, as these can exacerbate <med>bipolar symptoms</med>. Provide support and resources as needed.\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety planning, given the patient's history of passive suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes.\n7. **Follow-up and Monitoring:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> fluctuations, medication effectiveness, and adherence. Collaborate with the patient's support system to ensure consistent care.",
