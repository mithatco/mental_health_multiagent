The persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, and cognitive disturbances indicate a significant impairment in functioning. The presence of auditory hallucinations and delusional thoughts indicates the need for a thorough evaluation for a possible psychotic disorder. The patient's sleep disturbance, which includes insomnia and reversed sleep-wake cycle, is a critical area for intervention. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of social disconnect further suggest the presence of anxiety and a possible dissociative component. The patient's thoughts of self-harm without a clear intent or plan necessitate careful monitoring and safety planning. Overall, the patient's symptoms indicate a complex mental health presentation requiring comprehensive assessment and multimodal treatment interventions.",

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been struggling with a range of <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life and emotional well-being. You've expressed a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> about being watched or judged by others. You've also mentioned hearing voices and feeling like others can read your mind, which can be quite frightening. Your <sym>sleep</sym> patterns are disrupted, with you often staying awake at night and sleeping during the day. These challenges have led to feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and confusion about your identity. It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices) and <sym>delusions</sym> (believing that others can hear their thoughts) indicates <med>psychotic features</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support this diagnosis. The combination of these symptoms suggests a complex presentation of <med>MDD</med> with <med>psychotic features</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Medication Review**: Consult with a psychiatrist to review current medications and consider the addition of <med>antipsychotics</med> to manage <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Engage in <med>CBT</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> thoughts and behaviors. This can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and establish a regular <sym>sleep-wake cycle</med>.\n4. **Social Support**: Encourage engagement in <med>social activities</med> and support groups to combat feelings of <sym>isolation</sym> and <sym>social disconnection</sym>.\n5. **Safety Planning**: Develop a <med>safety plan</med> with the patient to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.\n6. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed to ensure effectiveness and safety.",
