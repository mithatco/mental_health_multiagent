Anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry and panic attacks, are also present and contribute to the patient's overall functional impairment. Cognitive difficulties and interpersonal withdrawal further complicate the clinical picture. The patient denies suicidal ideation and substance use, but the presence of depressive symptoms necessitates ongoing monitoring for suicide risk. The patient's somatic symptoms and cognitive impairment require further evaluation to determine etiology. Treatment should focus on symptom management, psychosocial support, and cognitive-behavioral interventions to address the patient's depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation and management.\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n- Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n- Interpersonal therapy to address social withdrawal and interpersonal difficulties.\n- Ongoing assessment of cognitive function and somatic symptoms.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've been feeling a persistent sadness and hopelessness, <sym>like nothing really matters anymore</sym>, and you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also been experiencing a lot of anxiety, feeling <sym>nervous and worried most of the time</sym>, and sometimes even <sym>panicking</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you feeling tired during the day, and you've noticed some physical symptoms like headaches and stomach pains. On top of that, you've been feeling disconnected from yourself and others, and it's been hard to find the motivation to do things. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and it's important to address these feelings and symptoms to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in daily activities</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>decreased motivation</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> present may indicate a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, but the primary symptoms point to a depressive episode. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>interpersonal withdrawal</sym> are common in severe depression and do not necessarily warrant a separate diagnosis at this stage.\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Referral to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a comprehensive evaluation and medication management. Antidepressants may be considered to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n2. Initiate <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address both <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>. This can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. Engage the patient in <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve interpersonal relationships.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym>, adjust treatment as needed, and prevent relapse.\n5. Further evaluation of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> to rule out other conditions such as <med>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</med> or <med>Mild Neurocognitive Disorder</med>.\n6. Monitor for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> during follow-up appointments, even if the patient denies current thoughts, as depression can fluctuate.\n7. Encourage the patient to maintain a <sym>regular sleep schedule</sym> and engage in gentle <sym>exercise</sym> to improve overall well-being.",
