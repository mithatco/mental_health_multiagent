There are also indications of an anxiety disorder, characterized by frequent anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors. The patient's reports of unexplained aches and pains, along with a belief that medical professionals are not taking these symptoms seriously, suggest a somatic symptom disorder. The patient's feelings of depersonalization during panic attacks and social withdrawal further exacerbate the clinical picture. Immediate intervention is warranted to address the suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. A comprehensive assessment and treatment plan, including potential referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and therapy for depression and anxiety, is recommended.",

      "predicted": "It is clear that you've been going through a very challenging time, marked by a significant <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and overwhelming <sym>anxiety</sym>. It's understandable that these feelings can make you feel isolated and disconnected from those around you. The <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>uneasiness</sym> you've described add to the overall distress, and it's concerning to hear about the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> you've experienced. It's important to acknowledge the <sym>depersonalization</sym> feelings you experience during panic attacks, as well as the <sym>social withdrawal</sym> you've been experiencing. It's crucial to address these issues promptly and comprehensively.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggest co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are consistent with severe <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Depression</med>. The <sym>uneasiness</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym> could be <sym>somatic manifestations</sym> of <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>. The <sym>depersonalization</sym> during panic attacks indicates a dissociative experience, which is common in severe <med>Anxiety</med>. The <sym>social withdrawal</sym> is a common feature of <med>Depression</med> and can exacerbate the condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss potential medication management for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Recommend CBT to address <med>Depression</med> and <med>Anxiety</med>, focusing on cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques.\n3. **Supportive Psychotherapy:** Provide a safe and supportive space to explore feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of identity</sym>, and <sym>social disconnection</sym>.\n4. **Suicide Prevention:** Implement immediate safety planning and a safety contract to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. Ensure the patient has a support system in place and access to crisis resources.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n6. **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure the patient's safety and well-being.\n7. **Collaboration with Primary Care:** Work closely with the patient's primary care provider to address <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and ensure comprehensive care.",
