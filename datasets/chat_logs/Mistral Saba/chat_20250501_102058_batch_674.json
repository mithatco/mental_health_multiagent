Today, we will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to assess how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. This assessment is designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health. Please know that this conversation is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you. We will be going through 23 questions. Let's start with the first one: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've mentioned a significant decrease in interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, feelings of sadness and hopelessness, increased irritability, and persistent anxiety. You've also been experiencing sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and feelings of detachment from yourself and others. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your daily life and relationships, and I want to assure you that it's important to address these <sym>symptoms</sym> together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent pattern of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, which are core features of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient experiences persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are indicative of an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym> from others and the environment may also suggest <med>depersonalization/derealization disorder</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> is a positive sign. The patient's <sym>withdrawal from social activities</sym> and <sym>relationships</sym> suggests a potential negative impact on social functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Suggest a referral to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Recommend a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, and <med>interpersonal therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to improve social functioning and relationships.\n3. Consider a trial of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) to target <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects and efficacy.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a consistent sleep schedule to improve overall well-being.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> to help the patient understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and the importance of adherence to treatment.\n6. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
