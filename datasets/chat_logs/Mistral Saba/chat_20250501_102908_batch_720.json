This assessment helps us understand how you've been feeling and any symptoms you've experienced over the past two weeks. Please know that this conversation is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's start with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things recently?"

It's understandable that these feelings can be overwhelming, but it's important to remember that you're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>decreased pleasure in activities</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>being on edge</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym>, suggest a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.
