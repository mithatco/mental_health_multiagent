        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a warm and professional tone."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult and effectively explored a wide range of symptoms. The therapist's approach was comprehensive, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language in some questions and increased emotional support in certain moments, the overall performance was excellent. With some refinement in clinical phrasing and empathetic responses, this conversation could be considered exceptional.",
