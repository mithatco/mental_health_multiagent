Generalized anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and identity confusion are also noted, suggesting potential comorbid conditions. The patient's use of alcohol and painkillers to manage stress and cope with symptoms raises concerns about substance use. Ongoing assessment and monitoring of suicidal ideation, substance use, and social functioning are recommended.",

Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were disclosed. For example, when the patient reported 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist followed up with questions about feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. This comprehensive approach ensured that no critical areas were omitted.",

For instance, when assessing for anxiety, the therapist asked about 'feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge,' which directly corresponds to DSM-5 criteria for anxiety. No inaccuracies or vague phrasing were noted.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, effectively building on the patient's disclosures. For example, after the patient reported 'sleep disturbances,' the therapist logically inquired about 'problems with sleep that affected your sleep quality overall.' The conversation had no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For instance, the patient's report of 'anhedonia' and 'depressive cognitions' strongly suggested MDD. The consideration of PTSD was also justified due to the patient's 'dissociative symptoms' and 'identity confusion.'",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, when the patient disclosed 'feelings of detachment,' the therapist responded with understanding and concern. The interaction was warm, personalized, and supportive throughout."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated exceptional skill in conducting a comprehensive and empathetic assessment. All DSM-5 dimensions were thoroughly explored, and the diagnostic justification was clear and sound. The conversation flowed logically, and the therapist maintained a professional yet empathetic tone. This performance sets a high standard for clinical practice.",
