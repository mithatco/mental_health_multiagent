        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For example, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' to assess depression, and 'feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge' for anxiety. The questions were phrased in clinically accurate ways, showing a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For instance, after the patient mentioned suicidal ideation, the therapist appropriately followed up with concern and did not abruptly change topics. The conversation had no noticeable logical inconsistencies, ensuring that the patient could express their symptoms freely.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For example, the patient's persistent depressed mood and anhedonia supported the diagnosis of MDD, while frequent anxiety and worry aligned with GAD. The presence of obsessions and compulsions suggested OCD. The justification was comprehensive, and the differential diagnosis was considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, expressing understanding and validation. For example, the therapist noted, 'It's understandable that these experiences can feel overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're reaching out for support.' The interactions were warm, personalized, and supportive, creating a safe space for the patient to share their experiences."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated exceptional clinical skill, with comprehensive coverage of DSM-5 dimensions, clinically relevant and accurate questions, logical consistency, clear diagnostic justification, and empathetic engagement. The therapist effectively explored all relevant symptoms, provided a clear rationale for the diagnoses, and maintained a supportive and professional demeanor. This conversation serves as a strong example of best practices in clinical assessment and therapeutic communication.",
