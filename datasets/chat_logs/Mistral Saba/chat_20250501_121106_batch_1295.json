      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a very challenging time lately. You've described feeling a profound sense of emptiness and loss of interest in things that used to bring you joy, such as painting. You've also mentioned feeling down, hopeless, and having frequent crying spells. It sounds like you're experiencing significant <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which can be really debilitating. The <sym>loss of interest</sym> in hobbies and activities, coupled with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, paints a picture of a potential <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest that there may be an underlying <med>anxiety disorder</med> as well. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> you're experiencing, such as headaches and back pain, could be related to the stress and depression. It's also concerning that you've had thoughts of hurting yourself, even though you don't have a specific plan. This indicates a need for careful monitoring and support.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (<med>MDD</med>) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (<med>GAD</med>\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that have been ongoing for at least two weeks. These symptoms, along with <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, are consistent with a <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> also suggests a <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even without a specific plan, is a significant concern that warrants immediate attention.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend evidence-based treatments such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (<med>IPT</med>) to address both the depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage the <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to help improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. **Suicide Prevention:** Implement a safety plan and ensure that the patient has a support system in place to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and intervene if necessary.\n6. **Evaluation of Somatic Symptoms:** Further evaluation of the <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> to determine if they are related to the <med>depression</med> or if there are other underlying medical conditions that need to be addressed.\n7. **Support Groups:** Recommend joining support groups or seeking social connections to combat <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and feelings of isolation.\n8. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
