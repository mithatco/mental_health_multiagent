You've described persistent feelings of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are understandably distressing. Additionally, you've mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, such as hearing voices and feeling like your thoughts are being read. It's clear that these experiences have been affecting your daily life, memory, and relationships. It's important to address these concerns to improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, including auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideations, warrants the specifier \"with psychotic features.\" Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further support this diagnosis. The <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> may be secondary to the depression and <sym>anxiety</sym>, but they also require careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consideration of <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, to address <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. If <sym>psychotic symptoms</med> persist, <med>antipsychotic</med> medication may be indicated.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Initiation of <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (<med>CBT</med>) or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</med> (<med>DBT</med>) to manage <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Support Groups:** Referral to support groups for individuals with <med>depression</med> and <med>psychosis</med> to provide a safe space for sharing experiences and coping strategies.\n5. **Substance Use Assessment:** A thorough assessment of <sym>substance misuse</sym> and referral to <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment if necessary.\n6. **Sleep Hygiene:** Education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n7. **Regular Follow-ups:** Regular check-ins with a mental health professional to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and address any emerging concerns.",
