This assessment is designed to help us understand how you're feeling and if there are any specific areas we should focus on. Your responses will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can respond based on how much or how often you've been bothered by each problem in the past two weeks. Let's start whenever you're ready."
