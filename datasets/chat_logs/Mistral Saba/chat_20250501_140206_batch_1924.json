This assessment will help us understand your current mental health status and guide our discussion. Everything you share will be kept confidential and used to create a safe and supportive space for you. You'll be asked 23 questions based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question."

For example, when asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist could have used more precise language from the DSM-5. Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could be more precise.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few moments where transitions could have been smoother. For instance, after the patient disclosed feeling detached from themselves, the therapist could have explored this symptom further before moving on to the next topic.",

The therapist provided a good justification for these diagnoses, citing specific symptoms like decreased interest, feeling down, and chronic anxiety. However, it would have been beneficial to discuss differential diagnoses and rule out other potential conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more emotionally responsive, such as when the patient discussed feeling detached from themselves."
