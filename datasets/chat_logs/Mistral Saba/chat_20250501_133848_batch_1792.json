      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've described feeling <sym>down, depressed</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>hopeless</sym>, which can make even everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You've also mentioned struggling with <sym>sleep</sym> and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. It's completely understandable that these feelings can make you feel isolated and unsure about your future. I'm really glad you've reached out for support, and I'm here to help you navigate through this challenging period.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> (<quote>I've felt nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge during the past two weeks</quote>), which is characteristic of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I've felt down, depressed, or hopeless...In fact, I've been having trouble sleeping</quote>) suggests <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors (<quote>I avoid going out in public if I can</quote>), <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (<quote>I worry about everything</quote>), and <sym>compulsive</sym> behaviors (<quote>I check things repeatedly</quote>) further support these diagnoses. The patient's passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (<quote>I've thought about wanting things to just go away</quote>) is a concerning symptom that warrants careful attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) to address <med>anxiety</med> and depressive symptoms. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consultation with a psychiatrist for potential <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anti-anxiety medication</med> to manage symptoms. Medications can be a helpful adjunct to therapy.\n\n3. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Introduce mindfulness practices and relaxation techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n\n4. **Interpersonal Therapy:** Given the patient's feelings of detachment from others and difficulty in relationships, <med>Interpersonal Therapy</med> (IPT) could be beneficial.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Encourage open communication about any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or worsening symptoms.",
