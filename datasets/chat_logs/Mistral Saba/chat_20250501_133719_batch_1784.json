Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - **Mood Lability:** The patient reports experiencing significant mood swings, including periods of depression with feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and periods of mania with increased energy and impulsivity.\n   - **Sleep Disturbances:** Extreme variations in sleep patterns, including insomnia during manic episodes and hypersomnia during depressive episodes.\n   - **Anxiety:** Feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge, particularly during the transition from manic to depressive states.\n   - **Impulsivity:** Increased impulsivity and engagement in risky behaviors during manic episodes, such as starting numerous projects and making impulsive financial decisions.\n   - **Depressive Symptoms:** Recurrent thoughts of worthlessness, lack of pleasure, and avoidance of social situations during depressive phases.\n   - **Cognitive Symptoms:** Difficulty concentrating and feeling detached or distant from oneself and surroundings during depressive episodes.\n   - **Social Withdrawal:** Withdrawal from relationships and feeling disconnected from others during depressive phases.\n   - **Substance Use:** Occasional alcohol use during manic episodes and previous misuse of prescribed antidepressants.\n\n**2. Patterns in Responses:**\n   - **Bipolar-Type Symptoms:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern consistent with bipolar disorder, marked by alternating periods of depression and mania.\n   - **Cyclical Nature:** The symptoms fluctuate in a cyclical manner, with periods of intense energy and impulsivity followed by periods of profound depression and lethargy.\n   - **Variable Intensity:** The patient's symptoms are highly variable in intensity, ranging from feeling invincible to feeling completely hopeless.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - **Bipolar Disorder:** The description of mood swings, sleep disturbances, and impulsive behaviors strongly suggests a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n   - **Anxiety:** Persistent anxiety symptoms, particularly during transitions between mood states, warrant further evaluation for co-occurring anxiety disorders.\n   - **Risk of Substance Use:** The patient's history of using alcohol during manic episodes and previous misuse of antidepressants indicates a potential risk for substance use disorder.\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Although the patient denies current suicidal thoughts, the history of suicidal ideation during depressive episodes is concerning and requires ongoing monitoring.\n\n**4. Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n   - **Impulsivity and Risky Behaviors:** The patient's history of impulsive decisions and risky behaviors during manic episodes poses a risk for harm to self and others.\n   - **Social Withdrawal:** Social withdrawal during depressive episodes may increase the risk of isolation and exacerbate depressive symptoms.\n   - **Substance Use:** The patient's history of alcohol use during manic episodes and previous misuse of antidepressants suggests a potential for substance use disorder.\n   - **Suicidal Ideation:** Past suicidal ideation during depressive episodes, even without current suicidal thoughts, necessitates careful monitoring for worsening symptoms.\n\n**5. Clinical Summary:**\n   The patient presents with a pattern of mood swings indicative of bipolar disorder, characterized by alternating periods of depression and mania. The patient reports significant depressive symptoms, including feelings of hopelessness, lack of pleasure, and social withdrawal, along with manic symptoms such as increased energy, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances. The patient also experiences anxiety symptoms, particularly during transitions between mood states, and has a history of substance use during manic episodes. The patient's history of suicidal ideation during depressive episodes and impulsive behaviors during manic episodes highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and intervention. Further assessment and treatment planning should focus on stabilizing mood, managing anxiety, and addressing potential substance use issues.",

You've described periods of profound <sym>depression</sym>, where you feel <sym>hopeless</sym> and disconnected from life, as well as episodes of intense <sym>mania</sym>, where you're bursting with <sym>energy</sym> and taking on numerous projects. These fluctuations have likely impacted your daily functioning and relationships, and it's understandable that you might feel misunderstood or isolated.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, Severe, with Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>mood swings</sym> between <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> during transitions, strongly suggests a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, such as feeling that others can hear your thoughts, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> during <sym>depressive episodes</sym> and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> during <sym>mania</sym> indicates a severe course of the illness. The patient's report of <sym>alcohol use</sym> during <sym>manic episodes</sym> and previous misuse of <med>antidepressants</med> suggests a potential risk for <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>.\n2. **Pharmacological Treatment:** Consider a combination of <med>mood stabilizers</med> and <med>antipsychotics</med> to manage <sym>mania</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. A <med>psychiatrist</med> can help determine the most appropriate <med>medication</med> regimen.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, as well as <med>interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT)</med> to stabilize daily routines and improve social functioning.\n4. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's <med>substance use disorder</med> risk and provide appropriate <med>substance abuse treatment</med> if necessary.\n5. **Family Involvement:** Encourage family involvement in therapy to educate them about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and <med>substance use disorder</med>, and to provide a supportive environment for the patient.\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Conduct regular assessments of <med>suicide risk</med> and provide appropriate safety planning to ensure the patient's well-being.\n7. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage regular <sym>sleep</sym> hygiene, exercise, and a balanced diet to support overall mental health and stabilize <sym>mood</sym>.",
