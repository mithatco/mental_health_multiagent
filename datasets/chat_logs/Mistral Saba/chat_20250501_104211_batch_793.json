This assessment is designed to help us understand how you're feeling and identify areas that may need further exploration. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer each one based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Let's begin with the first question."

Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms of generalized anxiety, avoidance behaviors, and dissociative experiences. The patient\u2019s recent divorce appears to be a significant stressor contributing to these symptoms. The patient\u2019s feelings of disconnection from self and others, as well as memory issues, further complicate the clinical picture. Close monitoring and further assessment are recommended to address potential suicidality and ensure comprehensive treatment.",
