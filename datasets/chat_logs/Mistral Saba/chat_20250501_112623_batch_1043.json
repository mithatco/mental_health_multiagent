Today, we will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure to assess how you have been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. This assessment is designed to help us understand your current mental health status and identify areas that might need further exploration. Your responses will be kept confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. We will go through 23 questions, and I'll start with the first one. Are you ready to begin?"

It's understandable that you've been feeling disconnected from the things you used to enjoy, and that <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> have been overwhelming. It must be incredibly difficult to live with the persistent <sym>flashbacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> that you've described. It's also concerning to hear about the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and increased alcohol use. It's important to know that what you're experiencing is valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (PTSD), and potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your responses, you exhibit several key <sym>symptoms</sym> of <med>MDD</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>emotional detachment</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of the accident, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, <sym>negative cognitions</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> are indicative of <med>PTSD</med>. The increased alcohol use to cope with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>emotional distress</sym> suggests a potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. These <sym>symptoms</sym> are interconnected and likely exacerbated by each other. <quote>I've been snapping at my family and friends over small things.</quote> This indicates <sym>irritability</sym>, a common <symptom</sym> in both <med>MDD</med> and <med>PTSD</med>. <quote>It's like I'm not really here, just going through the motions.</quote> This feeling of <sym>detachment</sym> is also common in these conditions. Given the severity and persistence of these <sym>symptoms</sym>, it's crucial to address them promptly.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a <med>mental health professional</med> for a comprehensive evaluation and to develop a treatment plan.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) for <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>, which can help process traumatic memories and change negative thought patterns.\n3. <med>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing</med> (EMDR) therapy, which can help reduce the intensity of traumatic memories.\n4. <med>Medication management</med> to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>PTSD</med>, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SSRIs</med>) or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors</med> (<med>SNRIs</med>).\n5. <med>Sleep hygiene</med> strategies and possible <med>medication</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n6. <med>Substance use counseling</med> to address increased alcohol consumption and prevent potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n7. Regular follow-ups to monitor <sym>symptoms</sym> and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
