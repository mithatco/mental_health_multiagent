The patient's symptoms are notably triggered by reminders of a past traumatic accident, and they report a high frequency of symptoms, including anhedonia, depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and depersonalization. Further assessment and treatment are warranted to address the patient's symptoms and develop a comprehensive treatment plan, including evidence-based therapies for PTSD and MDD, as well as strategies to manage alcohol use.",
