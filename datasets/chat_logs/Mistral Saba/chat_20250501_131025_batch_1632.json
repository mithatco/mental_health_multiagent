You've expressed feeling disconnected from others and even from yourself, and you've been dealing with <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, particularly in your back.

I'm really glad you've taken the first step to reach out and talk about what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe (Single Episode)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in daily activities, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. These symptoms have been present for more than two weeks and are causing significant impairment in the patient's functioning. The severity of the <sym>depression</sym> is indicated by the presence of <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> (excessive sleep) and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could be comorbid conditions, but the primary presentation is consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies, while IPT can help improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n2. **Medication:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> could be beneficial in managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>Pain management</med> for the <sym>back pain</sym> should also be addressed, with caution due to the patient's history of painkiller use.\n\n3. **Safety Planning:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan that includes identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support people to reach out to in times of crisis.\n\n4. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's substance use, including the use of painkillers and alcohol. Provide education about the risks of <med>substance use disorder</med> and offer treatment options if necessary.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure safety.",

The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use raise significant concerns that warrant immediate attention. The patient's feelings of detachment and disconnection from oneself and others suggest the possibility of a dissociative disorder. Comprehensive assessment and treatment planning should focus on addressing the primary depressive and anxiety symptoms, managing physical symptoms, and addressing potential substance misuse and suicidal ideation.",

While there is a mention of potential substance use (e.g., painkiller use), it is not explicitly identified or highlighted as the primary condition (substance_abuse).

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a lot lately, and I want to acknowledge the difficulty of what you're experiencing. You've shared that you've been feeling a persistent sense of gloom and hopelessness, with a decreased interest in activities you once enjoyed. You've also mentioned <sym>increased irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>excessive sleep</sym> that doesn't seem to provide relief. You've expressed feeling disconnected from others and even from yourself, and you've been dealing with <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, particularly in your back. It's also concerning to hear that you've had thoughts of hurting yourself. I'm really glad you've taken the first step to reach out and talk about what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Severe (Single Episode)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in daily activities, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. These symptoms have been present for more than two weeks and are causing significant impairment in the patient's functioning. The severity of the <sym>depression</sym> is indicated by the presence of <sym>psychomotor retardation</sym> (excessive sleep) and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> could be comorbid conditions, but the primary presentation is consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Refer the patient for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies, while IPT can help improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n2. **Medication:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> could be beneficial in managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. <med>Pain management</med> for the <sym>back pain</sym> should also be addressed, with caution due to the patient's history of painkiller use.\n\n3. **Safety Planning:** Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan that includes identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support people to reach out to in times of crisis.\n\n4. **Substance Use Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of the patient's substance use, including the use of painkillers and alcohol. Provide education about the risks of <med>substance use disorder</med> and offer treatment options if necessary.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure safety.",
