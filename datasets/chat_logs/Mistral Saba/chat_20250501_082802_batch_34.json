However, the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety could indicate a potential risk for future suicidal ideation if not addressed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of a major depressive disorder, including anhedonia, persistent sadness, irritability, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties. Additionally, the patient exhibits signs of generalized anxiety disorder, somatic symptoms, and social withdrawal. The patient's sleep disturbances, identity confusion, and feelings of detachment also warrant attention. The patient does not report suicidal ideation or substance misuse, which is reassuring. However, the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms necessitates a thorough evaluation and evidence-based treatment plan to prevent potential escalation of symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You've shared that you've been feeling a significant amount of sadness and hopelessness recently. You mentioned that activities you used to enjoy no longer bring you pleasure, and you often feel irritable and anxious. You've been experiencing physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, which you attribute to stress. Sleep has been challenging for you, and you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. You've also been withdrawing from friends and family, feeling uncertain about your future and your identity. It sounds like you've been going through a difficult time, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences. Your candor is a crucial first step in addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>I used to enjoy going out with friends, but lately, I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything</quote>), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (<quote>I feel sad and hopeless a lot of the time</quote>), and <sym>irritability</sym> (<quote>I find myself getting irritated more easily, and I snap at people sometimes</quote>). Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I've been sleeping more than usual. I just can't get out of bed in the morning</quote>), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (<quote>Sometimes I struggle to focus and remember things. It's hard to concentrate</quote>), and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> (<quote>I've withdrawn from my friends and family</quote>). These symptoms meet the criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Refer to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a comprehensive evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms.\n\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This evidence-based therapy can help the patient challenge negative thought patterns, manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, and develop coping strategies for <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n3. **Medication Management**: Consider starting the patient on an <med>antidepressant</med> medication to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. This should be done in consultation with a <med>psychiatrist</med>.\n\n4. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n\n5. **Lifestyle Recommendations**: Encourage the patient to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy diet, and prioritize self-care activities to support overall mental well-being.",
