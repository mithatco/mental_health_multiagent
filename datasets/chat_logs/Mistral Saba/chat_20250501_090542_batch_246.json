This assessment is designed to help us understand how you've been feeling and experiencing life recently. Please know that this conversation is confidential, and we're here to create a safe space for you. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and your answers will help guide our discussion. Let's start. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things over the past two weeks?"

The patient's withdrawal from social interactions and feelings of depersonalization are concerning and warrant further exploration. The patient's somatic symptoms, while unexplained, may be a manifestation of psychological distress. Given the severity and complexity of the symptoms, comprehensive psychotherapeutic intervention and close monitoring are recommended.",
