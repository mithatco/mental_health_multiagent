        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's responses, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound.

      "predicted": "I understand that you've been feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from your life. You've been experiencing a persistent sadness and loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, which has been accompanied by a pervasive sense of anxiety and a feeling of not being in control. You've also mentioned feeling irritable and angry, which seems to be causing strain in your relationships. Additionally, you've been dealing with <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> that have been making it hard for you to function normally. It's clear that these feelings have been affecting your daily life and your relationships. It's important to acknowledge the strength it took to share these feelings, and I'm here to help you navigate through this.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** Provisional <med>Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n***Reasoning:*** The patient's report aligns with the criteria for a <med>mixed anxiety-depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> suggests a <med>depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> indicate an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The co-occurrence of these symptoms in a persistent and impairing manner supports a provisional diagnosis of a <med>mixed anxiety-depressive disorder</med>. The patient's <med>obsessive thoughts</med> and <med>compulsive behaviors</med> could also indicate a comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, but the primary symptoms are more aligned with a mixed anxiety-depressive presentation. The <med>somatoform disorder</med> and <med>dissociative symptoms</med> are considered, but the primary cluster of symptoms is more indicative of a mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The patient's <med>cognitive difficulties</med> may be a result of the primary disorder or a comorbid condition that requires further evaluation.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n\n1. <med>Comprehensive psychological assessment</med> to further evaluate the nature and severity of the symptoms, including a detailed history and possibly standardized assessments.\n2. <med>Further evaluation of suicidal ideation</med> to ensure safety and rule out any immediate risk.\n3. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for <med>depression and anxiety</med> to address negative thought patterns and maladaptive behaviors.\n4. <med>Mindfulness and relaxation techniques</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med> such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> to manage symptoms of <med>depression and anxiety</med>, if indicated.\n6. <med>Continuous monitoring of cognitive symptoms</med> and their impact on daily functioning, with potential referral to a neuropsychologist if symptoms worsen.\n7. <med>Referral to a specialist</med> for <med>persistent somatic symptoms</med> or <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, if they do not improve with treatment for the primary disorder.\n8. <med>Psychoeducation</med> for the patient and possibly their support system to better understand the disorder and coping strategies.",
