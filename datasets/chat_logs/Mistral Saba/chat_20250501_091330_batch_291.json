The patient's vague and hesitant responses indicate potential discomfort in discussing symptoms, which may be due to underlying psychological distress or cognitive impairment. Further assessment is necessary to clarify the severity and impact of these symptoms on the patient's functioning. Immediate attention is required for suicidal ideation and perceptual disturbances, and further exploration of medication use and sleep disturbances is recommended.",
