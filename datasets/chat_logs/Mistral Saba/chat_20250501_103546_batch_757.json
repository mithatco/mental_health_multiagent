Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n   - Depressed mood and anhedonia: Patient reports feeling down, depressed, hopeless, and lacking interest or pleasure in activities.\n   - Anxious symptoms: Frequent feelings of anxiety, worry, and panic, with physical manifestations such as racing heart and difficulty breathing.\n   - Sleep disturbances: Increased sleep, difficulty waking up, and poor sleep quality with frequent awakenings.\n   - Cognitive symptoms: Feelings of being disconnected from oneself and surroundings, memory issues, and intrusive worries.\n   - Changes in behaviors: Withdrawal from social activities and relationships, irritability, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.\n   - Somatic symptoms: Unexplained headaches and stomachaches, possibly related to stress.\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n   - A pervasive theme of disinterest, hopelessness, and withdrawal following the divorce.\n   - Heightened anxiety and worry about future and current life circumstances.\n   - Sleep disturbances and cognitive issues contributing to a sense of disconnection and lack of personal identity.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n   - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, and associated symptoms such as sleep disturbances, cognitive changes, and somatic symptoms.\n   - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Excessive worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms of anxiety.\n   - Panic Disorder: Episodes of intense fear, heart racing, and difficulty breathing.\n   - Adjustment Disorder: Symptoms emerging in response to a significant life stressor (divorce).\n\n**4. Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n   - Suicidal ideation: Although the patient denies active suicidal intent, they have expressed passive suicidal thoughts (\"how much easier it would be if everything just ended\").\n   - Social withdrawal: Increased isolation and withdrawal from social support systems.\n\n**5. Summary in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with a depressive episode, including anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and cognitive changes. Co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and panic, along with somatic complaints, further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's recent divorce appears to be a significant stressor, contributing to these symptoms. The patient denies active suicidal intent but reports passive suicidal ideation, necessitating further assessment and monitoring of suicide risk. The patient's withdrawal from social activities and relationships may exacerbate feelings of isolation and despair. A thorough evaluation is warranted to rule out other potential etiologies and to develop an appropriate treatment plan. Close monitoring for suicidal ideation and worsening symptoms is indicated.",
