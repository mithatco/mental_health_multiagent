      "predicted": "I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences over the past two weeks, as it provides valuable insight into how you've been feeling. It's clear that you've been navigating significant emotional ups and downs, which can be incredibly challenging to manage. You've described periods of feeling profoundly <sym>depressed</sym> and hopeless, as well as times of heightened energy and impulsivity. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that have impacted your overall mood and functioning. It's also noteworthy that you've mentioned <sym>social withdrawal</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>excessive socialization</sym> during manic episodes, which can further complicate your emotional state.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Mixed\n\n***Reasoning:*** The patient's description of recurrent episodes of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> is indicative of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. During depressive episodes, the patient experiences <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, <sym>physical discomfort</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Manic episodes are marked by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. Additionally, <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms are present throughout but are more pronounced during depressive episodes. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including both <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, are characteristic of mood disorders. Social withdrawal during depression and excessive socialization during mania further support this diagnosis. The patient's report of fleeting thoughts of self-harm, while not active suicidal intent, is a concerning factor that warrants close monitoring.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety, and <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med> to stabilize daily routines and improve mood stability.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>mood stabilizers</med> such as lithium or valproic acid, and potentially <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>antipsychotics</med> depending on the severity and specific symptoms of the current episode.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on maintaining a regular sleep schedule and healthy sleep habits to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Risk Assessment and Safety Planning:** Conduct a thorough risk assessment for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan to manage any potential crisis situations.\n5. **Family and Social Support:** Encourage involvement of family or close friends to provide emotional support and help monitor mood fluctuations and risky behaviors.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure adherence to the treatment plan.\n7. **Education on Bipolar Disorder:** Provide educational resources and support groups to help the patient and their loved ones better understand <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> and its management.",
