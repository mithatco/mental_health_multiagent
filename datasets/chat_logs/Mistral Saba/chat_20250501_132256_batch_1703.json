You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, as well as feeling detached from yourself and others. These experiences have likely been overwhelming, and it's important to acknowledge the courage it took to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis.

Additionally, the patient reports occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although they deny any intent to act on these thoughts. While the patient also reports some <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, the pervasive and persistent nature of the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and their impact on the patient's functioning suggest a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient challenge negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to explore and improve interpersonal relationships and social functioning.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> medication as a potential adjunct to therapy. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered based on the patient's symptoms and preferences.\n\n3. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's <sym>substance use</sym>, including <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>painkiller misuse</sym>. Provide education on the risks of <sym>substance misuse</sym> and develop a plan to address any <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. **Follow-up Care:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care</med> activities and maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.",

They report a pervasive sense of sadness, anxiety, and avoidance, as well as significant sleep disturbances and cognitive changes. The patient's substance use and occasional suicidal ideation warrant careful monitoring and intervention.

Although it mentions substance use, it does not identify substance abuse as the primary condition. Instead, it suggests a comprehensive assessment of substance use as part of the treatment plan, indicating that substance abuse is not the primary diagnosis.",

      "predicted": "It is clear that you've been struggling significantly with your emotional well-being. You've shared that you've been feeling persistently down and hopeless, with a sense of <sym>anhedonia</sym> making it difficult to find joy in activities you once enjoyed. You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, as well as feeling detached from yourself and others. These experiences have likely been overwhelming, and it's important to acknowledge the courage it took to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnosis. These include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> manifesting as <sym>hypersomnia</sym>, and <sym>cognitive changes</sym> such as feeling lost and unsure about life goals. Additionally, the patient reports occasional <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although they deny any intent to act on these thoughts. While the patient also reports some <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, the pervasive and persistent nature of the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and their impact on the patient's functioning suggest a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient challenge negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>. Consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to explore and improve interpersonal relationships and social functioning.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consult with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> medication as a potential adjunct to therapy. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered based on the patient's symptoms and preferences.\n\n3. **Substance Use Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the patient's <sym>substance use</sym>, including <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>painkiller misuse</sym>. Provide education on the risks of <sym>substance misuse</sym> and develop a plan to address any <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n5. **Follow-up Care:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care</med> activities and maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.",
