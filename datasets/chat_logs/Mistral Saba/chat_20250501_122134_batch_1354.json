      "predicted": "You've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately, and it sounds like you're struggling with feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. It's clear that you're not enjoying the things you used to love, and you're experiencing a lot of physical discomfort along with <sym>cognitive</sym> and <sym>dissociative</sym> symptoms. It's understandable that you're feeling this way, and it's important to address these feelings and their impact on your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional Impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as persistent worry and occasional panic attacks, suggest a co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> you mentioned could be related to either of these disorders or may indicate a separate condition that requires further exploration. The <med>Provisional Impression</med> is used because there are multiple possible diagnoses that could explain your symptoms, and some may require further exploration.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychotherapy</med>: Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address both your <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n2. <med>Medication Management</med>: Discuss with a psychiatrist the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>antianxiety</med> medication to help manage your symptoms. Medication can be a useful tool in conjunction with therapy.\n\n3. <med>Sleep Hygiene Education</med>: Work with a healthcare provider to improve your sleep patterns. Good sleep hygiene can help reduce <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n\n4. <med>Regular Check-ins</med>: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\n5. <med>Cognitive Assessment</med>: Consider a comprehensive <med>cognitive assessment</med> to better understand and address your <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>.\n\n6. <med>Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques</med>: Incorporate practices such as mindfulness meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n7. <med>Support Network</med>: Encourage you to stay connected with friends and family, even if it feels challenging. Social support can be crucial in managing mental health.",
