This assessment is designed to help us understand your symptoms and how they might be affecting your life. Your responses will remain confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. There are 23 questions in total. Let's begin with the first one."

However, the presence of depressive symptoms and avoidance behaviors should be monitored for potential risk.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient denies alcohol and substance use, which is a positive factor.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms including depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, avoidance, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, dissociative experiences, identity confusion, interpersonal disconnection, and obsessive behaviors. These symptoms suggest the potential presence of multiple psychiatric conditions, including depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and somatoform disorder. Further assessment and diagnostic clarification are warranted to determine the exact nature and severity of these symptoms. The patient's lack of substance use is a positive factor, and the absence of suicidal ideation is reassuring. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary due to the presence of significant emotional distress and avoidance behaviors.",

Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. This comprehensive coverage justifies a score of 5.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For example, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' to assess depression, and 'feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge' for anxiety. The questions were clinically relevant and accurately phrased.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics based on the patient's disclosures. For instance, after the patient mentioned 'disturbing thoughts,' the therapist inquired about 'unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images that repeatedly enter your mind.' The conversation had no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Somatic Symptom Disorder clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For example, the patient's 'depressed mood and anhedonia' suggested Major Depressive Disorder, 'excessive worry and avoidance behaviors' indicated Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and 'unexplained aches and pains' pointed to Somatic Symptom Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone.
