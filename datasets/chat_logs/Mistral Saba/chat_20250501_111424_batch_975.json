A comprehensive assessment and treatment plan, including potential referral to a psychiatrist for medication management, is recommended.",

I feel really down and hopeless at times, like there's a dark cloud hanging over me. I've been snapping at my loved ones more often and feel guilty about it afterward, but I can't seem to control it. I've been avoiding places where I've had panic attacks before. It's like I'm trapped in my own home. I've had some stomach issues and headaches that come out of the blue. The doctors can't find anything wrong. I've had thoughts of hurting myself, and that scares me. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not really here. It's like I'm observing myself from a distance. I've withdrawn from my social life.
