You've also hinted at <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> to cope with your feelings. It's clear that you're struggling with a lot, and it's important to address these issues together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors also suggests a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's increased <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>tobacco use</sym>, and <sym>misuse of painkillers</med> indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>, warrant a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med> diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>substance use</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns. Also, consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>social isolation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n\n2. **Medication Management**: Consider prescribing <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med> to help manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Monitor for <sym>substance use</sym> and ensure that medications are used as prescribed.\n\n3. **Substance Use Counseling**: Refer the patient to a <med>substance use counselor</med> to address <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>tobacco use</sym>, and <sym>misuse of painkillers</sym>. This can help the patient develop strategies to reduce or eliminate <sym>substance use</sym>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding <sym>substance use</sym> close to bedtime.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Ensure that the patient feels heard and understood throughout the treatment process.\n\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment**: Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, assess <sym>suicide risk</sym> regularly and ensure that the patient has a safety plan in place. Provide resources for <sym>crisis intervention</sym> if needed.\n\n7. **Explore Identity and Life Goals**: Facilitate discussions about the patient's <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>feelings of being lost</sym>. This can include exploring personal values, interests, and life goals to help the patient gain a clearer sense of self.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, the therapist inquired about suicidal ideation and substance use, and explored the patient's feelings of detachment and identity confusion.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For instance, when asking about sleep disturbances, the therapist could have been more specific about the types of sleep issues (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia). However, the questions were largely clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use, and explored these topics in greater depth. The dialogue was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration, linking the patient's symptoms to specific DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments where the interactions seemed slightly impersonal or abrupt. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a warm and professional tone."

You've also hinted at <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> to cope with your feelings. It's clear that you're struggling with a lot, and it's important to address these issues together.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports multiple <sym>symptoms</sym> consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors also suggests a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's increased <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>tobacco use</sym>, and <sym>misuse of painkillers</med> indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and <sym>insomnia</sym>, warrant a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med> diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>substance use</med>. CBT can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns. Also, consider <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>social isolation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>.\n\n2. **Medication Management**: Consider prescribing <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>anxiolytics</med> to help manage <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>. Monitor for <sym>substance use</sym> and ensure that medications are used as prescribed.\n\n3. **Substance Use Counseling**: Refer the patient to a <med>substance use counselor</med> to address <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>tobacco use</sym>, and <sym>misuse of painkillers</sym>. This can help the patient develop strategies to reduce or eliminate <sym>substance use</sym>.\n\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education**: Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding <sym>substance use</sym> close to bedtime.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support. Ensure that the patient feels heard and understood throughout the treatment process.\n\n6. **Suicide Risk Assessment**: Given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, assess <sym>suicide risk</sym> regularly and ensure that the patient has a safety plan in place. Provide resources for <sym>crisis intervention</sym> if needed.\n\n7. **Explore Identity and Life Goals**: Facilitate discussions about the patient's <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>feelings of being lost</sym>. This can include exploring personal values, interests, and life goals to help the patient gain a clearer sense of self.",
