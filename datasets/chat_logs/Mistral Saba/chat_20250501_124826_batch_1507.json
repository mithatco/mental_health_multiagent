It's clear that you're feeling a significant loss of interest and pleasure in the things you used to enjoy, and you're constantly battling feelings of depression and emptiness. The struggles with sleep, anxiety, and <sym>memory</sym> issues are also taking a toll on you. It's understandable that you've been pulling away from others and feeling disconnected, as these <sym>symptoms</sym> can be overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge that you're having difficult thoughts about harming yourself, even if you don't have a plan. I'm really glad you've reached out and shared this with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (specifically early morning awakening), <sym>anxiety</sym> (<sym>constant worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (<sym>memory</sym> issues), <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> strongly suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>symptoms</sym> are also pervasive and impair the patient's daily functioning, further supporting this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>manic episodes</sym>, or <sym>substance use</sym> helps to rule out other potential diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with <med>depression</med>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial in managing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>depression</med> to help them understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. **Risk Assessment:** Continue to assess the patient's risk of self-harm, providing immediate resources and support as needed. Encourage the patient to reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline if <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> become more intense.\n7. **Collaboration with Other Healthcare Providers:** If applicable, collaborate with the patient's primary care physician to ensure a comprehensive approach to their care, addressing any potential <sym>physical health</sym> concerns that may exacerbate <sym>mental health</sym> symptoms.",

The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal may contribute to feelings of disconnection and exacerbate depressive symptoms. Further assessment is warranted to determine the severity of depressive symptoms, rule out other underlying conditions, and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The patient does not report any substance use or misuse, which is a positive factor. Close monitoring is recommended due to the presence of passive suicidal ideation.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing what you're experiencing. It's clear that you're feeling a significant loss of interest and pleasure in the things you used to enjoy, and you're constantly battling feelings of depression and emptiness. The struggles with sleep, anxiety, and <sym>memory</sym> issues are also taking a toll on you. It's understandable that you've been pulling away from others and feeling disconnected, as these <sym>symptoms</sym> can be overwhelming. It's important to acknowledge that you're having difficult thoughts about harming yourself, even if you don't have a plan. I'm really glad you've reached out and shared this with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (specifically early morning awakening), <sym>anxiety</sym> (<sym>constant worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (<sym>memory</sym> issues), <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> strongly suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>symptoms</sym> are also pervasive and impair the patient's daily functioning, further supporting this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>manic episodes</sym>, or <sym>substance use</sym> helps to rule out other potential diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with <med>depression</med>.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (<med>SNRIs</med>) may be beneficial in managing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n4. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient about <med>depression</med> to help them understand their <sym>symptoms</sym> and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. **Risk Assessment:** Continue to assess the patient's risk of self-harm, providing immediate resources and support as needed. Encourage the patient to reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline if <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> become more intense.\n7. **Collaboration with Other Healthcare Providers:** If applicable, collaborate with the patient's primary care physician to ensure a comprehensive approach to their care, addressing any potential <sym>physical health</sym> concerns that may exacerbate <sym>mental health</sym> symptoms.",
