      "predicted": "<a>I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. You've described experiencing a significant decrease in interest in activities you used to enjoy, feeling down and hopeless almost every day, and struggling with irritability and anxiety. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that keep recurring. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot, and it's understandable that this has been impacting your daily life. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences with me.</a>\n\n**Diagnosis:**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD) and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (OCD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>excessive anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's description of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> indicates the presence of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with these diagnoses and do not necessarily warrant a separate diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. <med>Psychotherapy</med>:\n   - Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) for MDD and GAD. CBT can help the patient challenge negative thoughts and develop coping strategies.\n   - <med>Exposure and Response Prevention</med> (ERP) therapy for OCD to help the patient manage <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and reduce <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n\n2. <med>Medication</med>:\n   - Prescribe <med>antidepressant medication</med> to target symptoms of MDD and GAD. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) could be considered.\n   - Consider <med>augmentation therapy</med> with <med>anxiolytics</med> for short-term management of severe <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n\n3. <med>Sleep Hygiene</med>:\n   - Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve sleep quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. <med>Monitoring and Follow-up</med>:\n   - Regularly monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, even if fleeting, and ensure safety planning is in place.\n   - Schedule follow-up appointments to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\n5. <med>Educational Resources</med>:\n   - Provide the patient with educational resources about MDD, GAD, and OCD to help them better understand their conditions and the available treatments.",
