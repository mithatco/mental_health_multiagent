Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you to express your experiences. There are 23 questions in total, and we'll go through them one by one. Let's begin. First, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks, either at all or just a little?"

Key findings include persistent depressed mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, increased irritability, and frequent anxiety and worry, particularly in social situations. The patient also reports sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, feelings of detachment, and social avoidance. These symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The patient denies any thoughts of self-harm, which is reassuring. However, the presence of dissociative symptoms and interpersonal distancing warrants further exploration to fully understand the extent and impact of these symptoms on the patient's daily functioning and overall well-being.\n\nRecommendations include a thorough psychiatric evaluation, consideration of potential pharmacotherapy, and initiation of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address both the depressive and anxious symptoms. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed.",

It's clear that you've been feeling down and anxious, struggling with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. <quote>I've definitely noticed that I'm not as interested in the things I used to enjoy.</quote> It's also evident that you've been feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others, which can be quite isolating. Let's explore these feelings further and find ways to support you.\n\n***Diagnosis:*** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n***Reasoning:*** Your report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in previously enjoyed activities, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> strongly suggests a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>deppersonalization/derealization</sym> further support these diagnoses. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> helps differentiate these disorders from other conditions.\n\n***Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:***\n1. **Psychoeducation**: Provide information about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> to help you understand your experiences.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Recommend CBT to address <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> medication to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene**: Implement strategies to improve <med>sleep quality</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n5. **Interpersonal Therapy**: Address feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from others and explore ways to enhance interpersonal relationships.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups**: Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress, adjust interventions as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
