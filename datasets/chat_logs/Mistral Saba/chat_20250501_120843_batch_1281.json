        "clinical_relevance": "The questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist phrased questions in clinically accurate ways that aligned with DSM-5 terminology and did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning. The language used was precise and aligned with clinical criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured smooth transitions and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis explicitly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",

The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

You've been feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, with a lot of <sym>racing thoughts</sym> and <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>. You mentioned that you feel <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>avoidant</sym> of situations that might trigger your <sym>anxiety</sym>, and you're experiencing <sym>physical</sym> <sym>pains</sym> like tension and <sym>abdominal discomfort</sym>. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> have been affecting your ability to enjoy life and connect with others, and it's understandable that you're seeking help to manage them. You've been dealing with a lot, and it's important to take your feelings and experiences seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>excessive anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about a variety of topics, including potential negative outcomes and loss of control, which is consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggests a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and <sym>frequent awakenings</sym>, are indicative of <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> are all consistent with these diagnoses. While the patient does not endorse <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>. CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or primary care physician for a medication evaluation. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> may be considered for <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> strategies to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Regular Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor <sym>symptom</sym> progression and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Assess for any changes in <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or worsening of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n\n5. **Interpersonal Support:** Encourage the patient to engage in social activities and seek support from friends and family. <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> may also be beneficial for addressing <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>.\n\n6. **Medical Evaluation:** Refer the patient for a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.",
