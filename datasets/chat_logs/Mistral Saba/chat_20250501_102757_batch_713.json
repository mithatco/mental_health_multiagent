We'll go through 23 questions, and you can answer each one based on how much or how often you've been bothered by the problems described. Let's begin."

Depressive episodes are marked by feelings of hopelessness, lack of interest, and social withdrawal, while manic episodes are marked by increased energy, reduced sleep, and risky behaviors. The patient's sleep patterns are disrupted and correlate with mood states. Interpersonal relationships are strained due to mood swings. The patient does not report psychotic symptoms or substance abuse, but there is a concern regarding adherence to treatment due to perceived lack of understanding from medical professionals. Further assessment and ongoing support are recommended to manage the bipolar symptoms and interpersonal challenges.",

      "predicted": "I appreciate you sharing these details about your experiences. It sounds like you've been navigating significant fluctuations in your mood and energy levels, which can be incredibly challenging. You've described periods of feeling down and unmotivated, as well as times of high energy and impulsive behavior. These mood swings have also impacted your sleep patterns, social interactions, and overall sense of self. It's understandable that these experiences can be overwhelming, and it's commendable that you're seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of alternating periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> strongly suggests a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. <quote>I've had periods where I've just felt really down and unmotivated... But there have been other times when I've been super energetic and just wanted to do everything at once</quote>. During depressive episodes, the patient experiences <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. During manic episodes, the patient exhibits <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>increased goal-directed activity</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, such as impulsive purchases. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that correlate with mood states and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> due to mood swings. The patient does not report <sym>psychotic features</sym> or <sym>substance abuse</sym>, which is consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> rather than <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> or <med>Cyclothymic Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>irritability</sym> during manic episodes are consistent with the mood episodes rather than a separate diagnosis. The <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>impact on relationships</sym> are also consistent with the diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with information about <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> to help them understand their condition and the importance of adherence to treatment.\n2. **Medication Management:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for evaluation and management of <med>mood-stabilizing medications</med> and/or <med>antidepressants</med> to manage the depressive and manic episodes.\n3. **Therapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient develop coping strategies for managing <sym>mood swings</sym> and improving <sym>interpersonal relationships</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education and strategies to improve <sym>sleep hygiene</sym>, which can help stabilize mood and reduce <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. **Psycho-social Support:** Encourage the patient to reach out to support groups or friends and family for additional emotional support.\n7. **Address Medical Non-Adherence:** Discuss the patient's feelings that their <sym>illnesses are not being taken seriously</sym> and work to address any underlying concerns to improve <med>treatment adherence</med>.",
