      "predicted": "I understand that you've been going through a significant amount of stress lately, particularly with your recent divorce. You've shared that you've been feeling down and hopeless, with little interest in activities you used to enjoy. You've also mentioned increased irritability, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>physical discomfort</sym> such as headaches and stomach issues. You've felt distant from yourself and others, and occasionally, thoughts of hurting yourself have crossed your mind. It's understandable that these feelings and experiences can be overwhelming, and I'm here to support you. <quote>I don't know who I am anymore. It's like I've lost my identity</quote>, you shared, which highlights the depth of your current emotional turmoil.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your constant <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>nervousness</sym> point towards <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>recent life stressors</sym> related to your divorce may be exacerbating these symptoms. The <med>bereavement exclusion</med> from <med>DSM-IV</med> has been removed in <med>DSM-5</med>, allowing for the consideration of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> in individuals experiencing significant life stressors. The <med>barevement exclusion</med> is not applicable here as the symptoms are not solely attributable to the bereavement.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms. CBT can help you develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n\n2. **Medication:** Discuss with your primary care physician or a psychiatrist the possibility of <med>antidepressant</med> or <med>anxiolytic</med> medications to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing your sleep environment.\n\n4. **Social Support:** Engage in activities that promote social connection, even if you don't feel like it initially. Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for emotional support.\n\n5. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. If these thoughts become more frequent or intense, seek immediate help from a mental health professional or a helpline.\n\n6. **Physical Health:** Address <sym>physical discomfort</sym> through medical evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can also improve both physical and mental well-being.",
