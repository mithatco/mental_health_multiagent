This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to share your experiences. This questionnaire has 23 questions, and I'll be asking you each one in turn. Let's start with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things lately?"

You've also been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> attacks, particularly when reminded of an accident you were involved in. Your <sym>sleep</sym> has been disrupted by insomnia and nightmares, and you've been using alcohol to cope with these issues. You've also mentioned <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as trouble concentrating and remembering things, as well as <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain.

Additionally, they exhibit <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> that are consistent with <med>MDD</med>. Their pervasive worries and anxiety, especially in public settings, suggest <med>GAD</med>. The use of alcohol to manage <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> raises concerns for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Trauma-Focused Therapy:** Implement cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques specifically targeted at <med>PTSD</med>, such as prolonged exposure therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider antidepressant medication to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are often effective for both <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n3. **Substance Use Intervention:** Address <med>alcohol use disorder</med> through behavioral therapies, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or CBT for substance use, and consider medications if appropriate.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement strategies to improve sleep quality, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. **Support System Engagement:** Encourage reconnection with friends and family to combat feelings of isolation and <sym>dissociation</sym>. This could involve family therapy or support groups.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and reassess for any changes in symptoms or <med>substance use</med>.",

The patient's avoidance behaviors, cognitive difficulties, and somatic complaints further complicate the clinical picture. Continuous monitoring for suicidal ideation and escalating substance use is crucial. A comprehensive treatment plan should address trauma-focused therapy, management of depressive symptoms, anxiety reduction, and substance use interventions.",

      "predicted": "I understand how challenging the past two weeks have been for you. You've been dealing with a profound loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, a persistent sense of hopelessness, and a heightened level of <sym>irritability</sym>. You've also been experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> attacks, particularly when reminded of an accident you were involved in. Your <sym>sleep</sym> has been disrupted by insomnia and nightmares, and you've been using alcohol to cope with these issues. You've also mentioned <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as trouble concentrating and remembering things, as well as <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain. It's clear that these experiences have taken a toll on your sense of self and your relationships, leaving you feeling distant from friends and family. You've also expressed feeling detached from your surroundings and yourself at times.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> (<med>PTSD</med>), <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<med>MDD</med>), <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<med>GAD</med>), <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (<med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>PTSD</med> as they report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, <sym>hyperarousal</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>. Additionally, they exhibit <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> that are consistent with <med>MDD</med>. Their pervasive worries and anxiety, especially in public settings, suggest <med>GAD</med>. The use of alcohol to manage <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> raises concerns for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Trauma-Focused Therapy:** Implement cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques specifically targeted at <med>PTSD</med>, such as prolonged exposure therapy or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors.\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider antidepressant medication to manage <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are often effective for both <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>.\n3. **Substance Use Intervention:** Address <med>alcohol use disorder</med> through behavioral therapies, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or CBT for substance use, and consider medications if appropriate.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement strategies to improve sleep quality, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. **Support System Engagement:** Encourage reconnection with friends and family to combat feelings of isolation and <sym>dissociation</sym>. This could involve family therapy or support groups.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and reassess for any changes in symptoms or <med>substance use</med>.",
