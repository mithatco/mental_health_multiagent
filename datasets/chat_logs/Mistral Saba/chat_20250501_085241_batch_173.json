      "predicted": "You've been through an incredibly challenging time, and it's clear that the aftermath of your accident has been taking a significant toll on your emotional well-being. You've been feeling <sym>down</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and <sym>irritated</sym>, and you've <sym>avoided</sym> many activities that you used to enjoy. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to the accident have made it difficult for you to engage in normal life, and you've been experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>memory problems</sym>. It's understandable that you've been <sym>withdrawing</sym> from social interactions and <sym>using alcohol</sym> to cope with these feelings. It's important to acknowledge the bravery it took to share these experiences, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Alcohol Use Disorder</med> (AUD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>PTSD</med> as they report <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> related to a traumatic accident. The presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> indicates <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's increased alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism suggests the development of <med>AUD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Referral to a <med>psychotherapist</med> for <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> focused on trauma, such as <med>Prolonged Exposure Therapy</med> (PE) or <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy</med> (CPT) to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n2. Referral to a <med>psychiatrist</med> for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and consideration of <med>pharmacotherapy</med> to manage <med>MDD</med> and <med>AUD</med> symptoms.\n3. Recommend <sym>alcohol</sym> use monitoring and consider <med>Substance Use Disorder (SUD)</med> treatment programs if necessary.\n4. Encourage regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust treatment plans as needed.\n5. Provide psychoeducation on <med>PTSD</med>, <med>MDD</med>, and <med>AUD</med> to empower the patient and their support system.\n6. Incorporate <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices and consider <med>sleep medicine</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n7. Encourage gradual reengagement in social activities and hobbies to reduce <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n8. Explore <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>.\n9. Assess for <med>cognitive impairments</med> and provide appropriate interventions if necessary.",
