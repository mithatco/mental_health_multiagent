Please know that this conversation is confidential, and my goal is to ensure you feel comfortable and safe. We'll go through 23 questions, and you can take your time to respond. Let's start whenever you're ready. First question: Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

Further evaluation is warranted to clarify the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The presence of suicidal ideation, even if passive, necessitates immediate attention and intervention to ensure the patient's safety.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was addressed with appropriate follow-up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped.

        "clinical_relevance": "The questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist phrased questions in clinically accurate ways that align with DSM-5 terminology and did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning. The language used was precise and aligned with clinical criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured smooth transitions and a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria. Alternative diagnoses were adequately considered and ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction throughout the conversation."

      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been going through a lot lately. You've shared that you've been feeling a lack of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, often feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. The irritability and anger you've been experiencing, along with the constant anxiety and panic attacks, must be incredibly challenging. It's also concerning to hear about the <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that have been affecting your daily life. It's understandable that you might feel isolated and disconnected from your surroundings at times. It's important to recognize that these feelings and experiences are valid, and it's crucial to address them with care and attention.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits**\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient presents with a cluster of <sym>symptoms</sym> that strongly suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The <sym>anxiety and panic attacks</sym>, along with <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, indicate a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> traits. The presence of <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> further complicates the diagnostic picture but does not fully meet the criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or a <med>Dissociative Disorder</med> alone.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychological Evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive psychological evaluation to further assess the depth and breadth of the <sym>symptoms</sym> and to rule out any co-occurring conditions.\n2. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Initiate <med>CBT</med> to address the <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive</sym> traits. This therapy can help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n3. **Medication Assessment:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for a medication assessment. <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other appropriate <med>antidepressants</med> may be beneficial for managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Teach mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n6. **Support System Engagement:** Encourage engagement with a supportive social network. This could include connecting with friends, family, or support groups to reduce feelings of isolation and provide emotional support.\n7. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This ensures ongoing support and addresses any emerging <sym>symptoms</sym> promptly.\n8. **Safety Planning:** Given the presence of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, develop a safety plan to ensure the patient's well-being. This includes identifying triggers, coping strategies, and emergency contacts.",
