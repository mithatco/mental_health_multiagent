You've shared that you've felt persistently down and hopeless, with a significant decrease in pleasure and interest in things you used to enjoy. Your sleep has been affected, with increased hours but poor quality, and you've been experiencing physical discomfort and <sym>anxiety</sym> in various situations. It's also clear that you've been feeling disconnected from yourself and others, which must be quite isolating. It's commendable that you've reached out and shared these feelings. It's a brave step towards understanding and managing what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in daily activities align with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 296.3x</sym>). The constant, pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and feeling on edge, accompanied by physical symptoms and avoidance behaviors, suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 300.02</sym>). Additionally, your repetitive thoughts, worries, and compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking) indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 300.3</sym>). While your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> could be related to these <med>mood and anxiety disorders</med>, they can also be a separate <med>sleep-wake disorder</med> that warrants further evaluation. Your <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> may be related to your mental health concerns and do not clearly warrant a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> diagnosis at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Establish a safety plan to manage any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or urgent <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including identifying triggers and coping strategies.\n2. Refer for a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, such as medical conditions or other <med>mental health disorders</med>.\n3. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>, including exposure and response prevention techniques for <med>OCD</med>.\n4. Monitor <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and implement sleep hygiene techniques to improve sleep quality. Consider a formal sleep study if necessary.\n5. Explore <med>medication management</med> options with a psychiatrist to target <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered based on individual needs and preferences.\n6. Encourage regular physical activity and a healthy diet to support overall mental health and well-being.\n7. Facilitate a follow-up appointment to assess progress, address any concerns, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",

      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a challenging time recently. You've shared that you've felt persistently down and hopeless, with a significant decrease in pleasure and interest in things you used to enjoy. Your sleep has been affected, with increased hours but poor quality, and you've been experiencing physical discomfort and <sym>anxiety</sym> in various situations. It's also clear that you've been feeling disconnected from yourself and others, which must be quite isolating. It's commendable that you've reached out and shared these feelings. It's a brave step towards understanding and managing what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in daily activities align with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 296.3x</sym>). The constant, pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and feeling on edge, accompanied by physical symptoms and avoidance behaviors, suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 300.02</sym>). Additionally, your repetitive thoughts, worries, and compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking) indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (<sym>DSM-5 300.3</sym>). While your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> could be related to these <med>mood and anxiety disorders</med>, they can also be a separate <med>sleep-wake disorder</med> that warrants further evaluation. Your <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> may be related to your mental health concerns and do not clearly warrant a <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> diagnosis at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Establish a safety plan to manage any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or urgent <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including identifying triggers and coping strategies.\n2. Refer for a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, such as medical conditions or other <med>mental health disorders</med>.\n3. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) to address <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>, including exposure and response prevention techniques for <med>OCD</med>.\n4. Monitor <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and implement sleep hygiene techniques to improve sleep quality. Consider a formal sleep study if necessary.\n5. Explore <med>medication management</med> options with a psychiatrist to target <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered based on individual needs and preferences.\n6. Encourage regular physical activity and a healthy diet to support overall mental health and well-being.\n7. Facilitate a follow-up appointment to assess progress, address any concerns, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
