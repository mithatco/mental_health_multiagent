      "predicted": "It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. <Quote>You mentioned feeling down and hopeless most of the time, with a constant weight on your chest</quote>. It's understandable that you would also feel irritated and angry more often than usual, and it's clear that these feelings are affecting your life significantly. You've also mentioned experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, <sym>persistent worries</sym>, and feeling <sym>detached from others</sym>. These feelings are all valid and it's important to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits a persistent pattern of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> that have been present for the past two weeks. These include a lack of interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia), feelings of hopelessness, and a loss of energy. The patient also reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> such as difficulty concentrating and memory issues, and <sym>interpersonal distress</sym>. These symptoms align with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the <med>DSM-5</med>. The patient does not report <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, which would be indicative of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> or other <med>psychotic disorders</med>. There is also no evidence of <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym>, further supporting the diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to address the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. These therapies can help the patient develop coping strategies and improve interpersonal relationships.\n\n2. **Medication:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for an evaluation for <med>antidepressant medication</med> if the <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> are severe or not improving with therapy alone. Commonly prescribed medications include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>. This may include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.\n\n4. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Ensure the patient feels supported and that their concerns are being addressed.\n\n5. **Assess for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>:** Although the patient denies current substance use, it is important to continually assess for any potential <med>substance use disorders</med> or misuse, particularly given the patient's history of substance use.\n\n6. **Explore <med>Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques</med>:** Recommend practices such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n\n7. **Educate on <med>Cultural Considerations</med>:** Be mindful of the patient's cultural background and how it may influence their <sym>symptoms</sym> and treatment preferences. Adapt the treatment plan accordingly to ensure cultural competence.",
