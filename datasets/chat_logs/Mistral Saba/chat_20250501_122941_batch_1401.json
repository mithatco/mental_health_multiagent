      "content": "**1. Compassionate Summary**\n\nIt sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling a lot of sadness and hopelessness, and even the things you used to enjoy no longer bring you much pleasure. You've been struggling with sleep and worrying a lot, and it feels like you're always on edge. It's also been hard for you to connect with others and feel like yourself. These feelings can be overwhelming, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. It's great that you're reaching out and taking the first step towards getting support.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pervasive pattern of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that is consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> including <sym>early morning awakenings</sym> and <sym>non-restorative sleep</sym>, which are common in <med>depression</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>concentration problems</sym>, and <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about themselves, which are also indicative of <med>depression</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support this diagnosis. While the patient reports <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as <sym>excessive worry</sym> and <sym>fear</sym>, these are likely secondary to the <med>depressive symptoms</med> and do not meet the full criteria for a separate <med>anxiety disorder</med> diagnosis at this time. The patient's <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> is a significant concern and warrants immediate attention.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to assess the patient's current level of risk and develop a safety plan. This may include identifying triggers, removing access to lethal means, and establishing a support system.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> is recommended to help the patient challenge and modify <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>behaviors</sym> associated with <med>depression</med>. Additionally, <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> may be beneficial to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n3. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or primary care physician for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help the patient improve sleep quality, which may involve establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient and their support system about <med>depression</med>, its symptoms, and treatment options to reduce stigma and encourage adherence to the treatment plan.\n7. **Referral to Support Groups:** Consider referring the patient to support groups for <med>depression</med> to provide a safe space for sharing experiences, learning coping strategies, and building a support network.",

Additionally, the patient exhibits signs of generalized anxiety disorder, characterized by excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and a sense of impending doom. Cognitive symptoms include memory difficulties and concentration problems, which may be secondary to the emotional distress. The patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and back pain, which are likely exacerbated by stress. There is a notable loss of interest in social activities and relationships, contributing to a sense of detachment and social withdrawal. The patient reports passive suicidal ideation, indicating a significant risk for self-harm. The patient denies substance use and misuse of prescription medications. Overall, the patient's presentation suggests a complex interplay of depressive and anxious symptoms, with potential cognitive and somatic comorbidities, and a significant risk of social isolation and self-harm.",

      "predicted": "**1. Compassionate Summary**\n\nIt sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately. You've mentioned feeling a lot of sadness and hopelessness, and even the things you used to enjoy no longer bring you much pleasure. You've been struggling with sleep and worrying a lot, and it feels like you're always on edge. It's also been hard for you to connect with others and feel like yourself. These feelings can be overwhelming, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in this. It's great that you're reaching out and taking the first step towards getting support.\n\n**<Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**<Reasoning:** The patient presents with a pervasive pattern of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that is consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> including <sym>early morning awakenings</sym> and <sym>non-restorative sleep</sym>, which are common in <med>depression</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>concentration problems</sym>, and <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about themselves, which are also indicative of <med>depression</med>. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further support this diagnosis. While the patient reports <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as <sym>excessive worry</sym> and <sym>fear</sym>, these are likely secondary to the <med>depressive symptoms</med> and do not meet the full criteria for a separate <med>anxiety disorder</med> diagnosis at this time. The patient's <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> is a significant concern and warrants immediate attention.\n\n**<Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Safety Assessment:** Given the patient's passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it is crucial to assess the patient's current level of risk and develop a safety plan. This may include identifying triggers, removing access to lethal means, and establishing a support system.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> is recommended to help the patient challenge and modify <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>behaviors</sym> associated with <med>depression</med>. Additionally, <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> may be beneficial to address <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n3. **Medication Evaluation:** Refer the patient to a psychiatrist or primary care physician for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed for <med>major depressive disorder</med>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> to help the patient improve sleep quality, which may involve establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Educate the patient and their support system about <med>depression</med>, its symptoms, and treatment options to reduce stigma and encourage adherence to the treatment plan.\n7. **Referral to Support Groups:** Consider referring the patient to support groups for <med>depression</med> to provide a safe space for sharing experiences, learning coping strategies, and building a support network.",
