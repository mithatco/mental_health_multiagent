However, some domains like mania, psychosis, and repetitive thoughts/behaviors were only superficially covered or not directly assessed with specific questions. For example, the therapist did not directly inquire about the patient's experiences with mania (questions 4 and 5) or psychosis (questions 12 and 13) in a detailed manner. Additionally, while the therapist touched on substance use, it was not probed deeply.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were instances of slight inaccuracies or vague phrasing. For example, when asking about sleep disturbances, the therapist could have been more specific about the frequency and duration of the symptoms. However, the questions were mostly clinically relevant and targeted the patient's symptoms effectively. The therapist adapted questions to the patient's responses, showing a good understanding of clinical relevance.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies, such as abrupt transitions between topics. For example, the therapist moved quickly from discussing sleep disturbances to feelings of detachment without fully exploring the impact of sleep issues on the patient's daily life. Overall, the conversation was coherent and easy to follow.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear justification for the diagnosis of Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Features, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The diagnosis aligns with the DSM-5 criteria, and the therapist explicitly linked the patient's symptoms to the diagnostic conclusions. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing alternative diagnoses that were considered and ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses showed empathy and a natural conversational style. They acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, the therapist expressed understanding and validated the patient's feelings of being 'really down' and 'moody.' However, there were minor moments where the therapist's responses seemed slightly robotic or impersonal, such as when discussing substance use."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a good understanding of the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and effectively explored most domains. The conversation was generally coherent and empathetic. However, some domains were not thoroughly addressed, and minor issues with logical flow and clinical phrasing were noted.
