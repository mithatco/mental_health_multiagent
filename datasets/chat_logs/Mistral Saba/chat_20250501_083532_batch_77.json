      "predicted": "It's clear that you've been experiencing a great deal of emotional and cognitive distress. You've shared that you've lost interest in activities you used to enjoy, feel persistently sad and hopeless, and have difficulty finding meaning in life. You've also mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as early morning awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, as well as <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, like <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>confusion</sym>. Additionally, you've been feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, and you've withdrawn from social situations and relationships. These experiences sound incredibly challenging, and it's important to address them with care and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation aligns with the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as outlined in the <med>DSM-5</med>. The core <sym>symptom</sym> of <sym>anhedonia</sym> is evident, as the patient reports <quote>lost interest in a lot of things I used to enjoy</quote>. Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue or loss of energy</sym>, <sym>decreased ability to think or concentrate</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>. The patient's <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> and <sym>withdrawal from relationships</sym> could also be indicative of <med>MDD</med>. While the patient reports occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, they deny any active plans or intentions, which is important to monitor closely. The <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> may be related to the <med>anhedonia</med> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, but they could also warrant further assessment for other potential underlying conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> to help the patient process their emotions, challenge negative thought patterns, and improve coping strategies.\n   - CBT can help address <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n   - IPT can help improve interpersonal relationships and social functioning.\n\n2. **Medication Management:** Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n   - Common first-line treatments include <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep quality</sym> through better <med>sleep hygiene</med>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Cognitive Assessment:** Conduct a thorough <med>cognitive assessment</med> to better understand the patient's <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>confusion</sym>, as these could be related to <med>MDD</med> or may indicate another underlying condition that requires attention.\n\n5. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and ensure their safety and well-being, especially given the patient's occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>.",
