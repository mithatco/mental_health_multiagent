This assessment will help us understand how you've been feeling and identify areas that might need further exploration. Your responses will be kept confidential, and we'll create a safe space for you to share openly. We'll go through 23 questions. Let's begin with the first question. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things during the past two weeks?"

You've described feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>empty</sym>, with a significant loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You're experiencing increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, all of which seem to be affecting your daily life and relationships. You've also mentioned <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and a sense of detachment from yourself and others. It's important to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences are valid and deserve attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>negative thoughts</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> aligns with the criteria for a major depressive disorder. The presence of <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, such as feeling detached from oneself and surroundings, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's thoughts of self-harm, although not considered serious, indicate a need for continued <sym>suicide risk assessment</sym>.\nAlso, the patient denies <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym>, which helps to rule out <med>psychotic disorders</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough <med>mental health evaluation</med> to assess the severity of <sym>depression</sym> and rule out other potential <med>mental health conditions</med>.\n2. Refer the patient for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med>, to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>.\n3. Prescribe <med>antidepressant medication</med> as needed, based on the patient's symptoms and preferences, and monitor for <med>side effects</med> and <med>efficacy</med>.\n4. Refer the patient for a <med>medical evaluation</med> to rule out any underlying <med>physical conditions</med> that could be contributing to <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n5. Monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>risk factors</sym> regularly, and ensure a <med>safety plan</med> is in place.\n6. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med> and <med>support groups</med> to promote <med>coping skills</med> and <med>social connection</med>.\n7. Consider <med>family therapy</med> to address any <sym>relationship concerns</sym> and provide support for the patient and their loved ones.",
