Your responses will remain confidential, and we will work together to ensure you feel safe and comfortable. This questionnaire consists of 23 questions. Let's begin with the first one. Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two weeks?"

You've mentioned feeling <sym>less interested</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, and sometimes feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> about the future. It's also been tough managing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, and you've been avoiding situations that trigger these feelings. You've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others. It's understandable that these experiences can be overwhelming, and I'm here to help you navigate through them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits several <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including anhedonia, low mood, and feelings of hopelessness, which are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms of anxiety suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from oneself and surroundings indicate <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> and the patient's denial of any <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> support this diagnosis over others.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To address <sym>depressive</sym> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, CBT can help the patient identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n2. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Techniques such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation can help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n3. **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** To address <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, IPT can help improve <sym>relationship</sym> skills and social functioning.\n4. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider a consultation with a psychiatrist to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications if <sym>therapeutic interventions</sym> alone are insufficient.\n5. **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Provide education on good <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>fatigue</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
