This assessment is designed to help us understand how you're feeling and any symptoms you might be experiencing. It will cover various aspects of your mental health. Your responses will remain confidential, and the goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I'll read each one to you. Let's begin. Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things in the past two weeks?"
