These <sym>symptoms</sym> have been causing you considerable distress and impacting your daily life. It's important to recognize the strength it takes to acknowledge these feelings and seek support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Provisional impression of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Dissociative</med> features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym> (<quote>I used to love going out with friends, but lately, I just don't feel like it</quote>), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (<quote>I sleep a lot, actually. I wake up around 4 or 5 in the morning and can't go back to sleep</quote>), <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym> (<quote>All the time. It's hard to relax, even when I'm by myself</quote>), <sym>avoidance</sym> (<quote>I've been avoiding going out more</quote>), and <sym>dissociative</sym> <sym>symptoms</sym> (<quote>Sometimes I feel disconnected from everything, like I'm watching my life from a distance</quote>) suggests a pattern consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. <med>Anxiety</med> features are evident through <sym>excessive worry</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, while <med>Dissociative</med> features are present through <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. <med>Suicidal ideation</med> is also present, further supporting the diagnosis (<quote>I've had some dark thoughts, but nothing specific. Just that maybe things would be better if I weren't around</quote>). No manic or psychotic features are present, and there is no evidence of substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, as well as <sym>dissociative</sym> features.\n\n2. **Medication:** Consult with a <med>psychiatrist</med> to discuss <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as <med>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** Implement <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.\n\n4. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan to address <med>suicidal ideation</med>, including identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support resources.\n\n5. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, reassess symptoms, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\n6. **Psychoeducation:** Provide education about <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety</med>, and <med>Dissociation</med> to help the patient better understand their experiences and treatment options.",
