Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to get a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks across various areas, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask them one by one. Are you ready to begin?"

You're dealing with increased <sym>anxiety, worry, and feelings of being on edge</sym>, along with occasional <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Social withdrawal and a sense of disconnect from yourself and your surroundings are also impacting your daily life, and intrusive negative thoughts about worthlessness have been troubling you. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of being dismissed by others and some fleeting thoughts of self-harm, which are important safety considerations. Overall, your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms that are significantly affecting your well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and cognitive disturbances</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance characterized by early awakening and non-restorative sleep, along with concentration difficulties and feelings of disconnect, support this diagnosis. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including excessive worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors, indicates comorbid <med>Anxious Distress</med>. The transient dissociative experiences and intrusive thoughts further suggest cognitive disturbances often associated with severe depression. The patient's report of fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, although not active plans, highlights the severity and need for careful monitoring. No evidence of psychosis or substance misuse was found, and somatic complaints appear to be psychosomatic in nature.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including evaluating the risk of self-harm or suicidality, and develop a safety plan if indicated.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) in conjunction with <sym>psychotherapy</sym> like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n4. Monitor symptoms closely over time for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening mood, and provide support for social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities as tolerated, and explore potential underlying psychosocial stressors in therapy.",

Reports of anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal suggest features consistent with depressive symptomatology. Additionally, the patient reports disturbances in sleep patterns\u2014early morning awakenings and non-restorative sleep\u2014along with fatigue and concentration difficulties, further supporting a depressive diagnosis.\n\nAnxiety features are prominent, including excessive worry, feelings of being on edge, occasional panic-like episodes, and avoidance of social situations due to discomfort, indicating comorbid anxiety symptoms. The patient also notes irritability and increased emotional reactivity, which may contribute to interpersonal challenges.\n\nSomatic complaints, such as unexplained headaches and musculoskeletal aches, are present but without clear medical etiology, potentially reflecting psychosomatic manifestations of underlying distress.\n\nIntrusive negative thoughts about worthlessness and being a burden, coupled with fleeting suicidal ideation without intent or plan, are notable safety concerns. The patient reports transient dissociative experiences (feeling detached or outside oneself) and difficulties with memory and concentration, which may suggest cognitive effects associated with depression or anxiety.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal ideation, social withdrawal, and feelings of disconnection. No substance use or psychotic symptoms are reported.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a severe depressive syndrome characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and social withdrawal, with prominent comorbid anxiety features and transient dissociative experiences. These findings warrant close monitoring of suicidal risk and comprehensive assessment to inform diagnostic formulation and treatment planning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. It sounds like you've been experiencing persistent <sym>low mood, lack of interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned difficulties with sleep, waking early and feeling exhausted despite rest, which can be very draining. You're dealing with increased <sym>anxiety, worry, and feelings of being on edge</sym>, along with occasional <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Social withdrawal and a sense of disconnect from yourself and your surroundings are also impacting your daily life, and intrusive negative thoughts about worthlessness have been troubling you. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of being dismissed by others and some fleeting thoughts of self-harm, which are important safety considerations. Overall, your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms that are significantly affecting your well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and cognitive disturbances</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance characterized by early awakening and non-restorative sleep, along with concentration difficulties and feelings of disconnect, support this diagnosis. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including excessive worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors, indicates comorbid <med>Anxious Distress</med>. The transient dissociative experiences and intrusive thoughts further suggest cognitive disturbances often associated with severe depression. The patient's report of fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, although not active plans, highlights the severity and need for careful monitoring. No evidence of psychosis or substance misuse was found, and somatic complaints appear to be psychosomatic in nature.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including evaluating the risk of self-harm or suicidality, and develop a safety plan if indicated.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) in conjunction with <sym>psychotherapy</sym> like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n4. Monitor symptoms closely over time for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening mood, and provide support for social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities as tolerated, and explore potential underlying psychosocial stressors in therapy.",
