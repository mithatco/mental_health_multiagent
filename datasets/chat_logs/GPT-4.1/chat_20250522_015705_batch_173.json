Anxiety symptoms are evident, including generalized worry, episodic panic symptoms (heart racing, sudden fear), and avoidance behaviors associated with social and situational anxieties. Sleep disturbances are prominent, involving difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, which may exacerbate mood and cognitive difficulties. Cognitive complaints include memory problems and episodes of derealization or depersonalization, indicating possible dissociative features.\n\nIntrusive thoughts, compulsive-like behaviors (checking, cleaning), and feelings of emotional detachment suggest comorbid obsessive-compulsive or dissociative symptoms. The patient reports significant feelings of being misunderstood and dismissed by others, indicating potential social or interpersonal difficulties. Substance use behaviors include habitual smoking, alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, and recreational drug use without medical supervision, which pose additional health risks.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include expressions of hopelessness, dark thoughts, and passive thoughts of self-harm, indicating elevated suicide risk. The presence of mood disturbance, psychomotor agitation (irritability), sleep disruption, and substance misuse warrants careful risk assessment and monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex presentation with features consistent with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possibly dissociative or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Comorbid substance use and passive suicide ideation necessitate thorough safety planning and integrated treatment approaches.",
