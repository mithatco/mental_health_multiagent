I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool that helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment covers symptoms like mood, anxiety, sleep, and other emotional or physical concerns. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. The process will involve 23 questions, and I will ask them one at a time. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also mention increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and a tendency to <sym>avoid social situations</sym> because of this anxiety. Sleep has been problematic, with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, and you note some <sym>cognitive issues</sym> such as forgetfulness and feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. You have also expressed <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning. Despite these challenges, you haven't engaged in risky behaviors or substance misuse recently, but the feelings of distress are clearly impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>, such as <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, with anxious distress features</med>.

Overall, the symptoms align with a moderate severity of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with notable anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicide, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressant medication such as an SSRI or SNRI, especially given the severity of symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, cognitive distortions, and coping skills.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions for sleep hygiene or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate treatment response, symptom progression, and safety concerns.  \n6. Consider assessment for underlying medical conditions that may contribute to cognitive or physical symptoms, such as thyroid function or neurological evaluation if necessary.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, characterized by pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent depression over the past two weeks. These core symptoms are complemented by notable anxiety features, including heightened worry, agitation, and panic attacks, as well as avoidance behaviors related to social situations. Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of increased sleep duration coupled with non-restorative sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep continuity. Cognitive concerns include impaired memory and disorientation in familiar environments, which may suggest cognitive or neurovegetative impacts associated with mood or anxiety pathology.\n\nThe patient reports feelings of emotional numbness, disconnection from self and surroundings (dissociative experiences), and occasional intrusive thoughts. There is a history of passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent, which warrants careful risk assessment. No auditory or visual hallucinations are reported, and substance use appears limited and non-problematic.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Symptomatology aligns with major depressive features, including anhedonia, hopelessness, psychomotor changes, and sleep disruption.\n- Elevated anxiety levels, panic symptoms, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid anxiety disorders.\n- Cognitive disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and dissociative feelings may reflect heightened emotional distress or possible dissociative features.\n- Passive suicidal ideation raises potential safety concerns requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Expressed hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts constitute significant risk factors for self-harm, necessitating safety planning and close evaluation.\n- Mood and anxiety symptoms are persistent and impairing, impacting functioning and social engagement.\n- Dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties add complexity to clinical management.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation of major depressive disorder with prominent anxiety components, cognitive disturbances, and dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation underscores the need for careful risk assessment. The clinical picture warrants comprehensive evaluation, including safety planning, potential diagnostic clarification, and formulation of an integrated treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, cognitive, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and symptoms over the past two weeks. You describe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mention increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and a tendency to <sym>avoid social situations</sym> because of this anxiety. Sleep has been problematic, with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, and you note some <sym>cognitive issues</sym> such as forgetfulness and feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. You have also expressed <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning. Despite these challenges, you haven't engaged in risky behaviors or substance misuse recently, but the feelings of distress are clearly impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>, such as <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, with anxious distress features</med>. The reported <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, dissociative feelings, and intrusive thoughts further support a complex mood-anxiety presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful safety monitoring but does not currently indicate active planning or intent. Overall, the symptoms align with a moderate severity of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with notable anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicide, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressant medication such as an SSRI or SNRI, especially given the severity of symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, cognitive distortions, and coping skills.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions for sleep hygiene or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate treatment response, symptom progression, and safety concerns.  \n6. Consider assessment for underlying medical conditions that may contribute to cognitive or physical symptoms, such as thyroid function or neurological evaluation if necessary.",
