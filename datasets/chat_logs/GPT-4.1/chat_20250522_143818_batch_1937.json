This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers various areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I encourage you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "The patient presents with a profound sense of emotional distress, marked by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, indicating a significant loss of pleasure in activities they once enjoyed. They report ongoing feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>guilt</sym>, and emotional numbness, which suggest the presence of <med>major depressive symptoms</med>. Additionally, trauma-related symptoms are prominent, including intrusive <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and heightened <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, especially in response to cues associated with the recent <med>traumatic event</med>. The individual exhibits <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as steering clear of driving and situations that trigger anxiety, along with somatic complaints like headaches and muscle pains related to trauma reminders. They also describe dissociative experiences, feeling numb or disconnected from themselves and their surroundings, which further complicates their clinical picture. Anxiety symptoms, including increased <sym>startle response</sym> and panic-like reactions, are evident. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships are also notable, along with passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, indicating significant distress and functional impairment. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex interplay of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, and dissociative features, requiring careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> is supported by the patient's trauma-related symptoms, including intrusive memories, nightmares, hyperarousal, avoidance, and dissociative experiences, all of which align with the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. The presence of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a significant depressive component, warranting a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feeling numb and disconnected, are common in trauma-related disorders and suggest a dissociative subtype or features within PTSD. The overlap of symptoms and the trauma history justify a diagnosis that encompasses both PTSD and depression, with attention to the dissociative phenomena contributing to overall impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE), to address trauma-related symptoms.  \n2. Consider psychiatric evaluation for pharmacotherapy, including antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) to target depressive and PTSD symptoms.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses and dissociation, and develop safety and stabilization strategies.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place, given the passive thoughts of self-harm.  \n5. Coordinate care with a trauma specialist if available, and consider referrals for additional support, such as group therapy or trauma support groups.",

Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and hyperarousal (Q5, Q15). The patient's mood symptoms are compounded by trauma-related symptoms, notably intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance (Q10, Q13, Q17), indicating significant post-traumatic stress features. Anxiety is prominent, with reports of heightened startle response, avoidance behaviors (Q7\u2013Q9), and physiological hyperarousal (Q5, Q7). The patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle pains associated with trauma reminders (Q10), alongside cognitive concerns including forgetfulness and disorientation (Q16). Dissociative symptoms are evident, with feelings of numbness, detachment, and a sense of disconnection from self and surroundings (Q19, Q20). Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships are noted (Q21). \n\nPatterns suggest a complex presentation involving major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and features of dissociation. The patient endorses passive suicidal thoughts without current intent (Q12). The presence of hyperarousal, avoidance, intrusive memories, and dissociative symptoms are clinically significant, indicating high levels of trauma-related distress and functional impairment. Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation and dissociation, which warrant careful monitoring. Overall, the clinical picture reflects an individual experiencing substantial trauma-related symptoms compounded by mood disturbances, with potential for significant functional impairment and risk if not addressed appropriately.",

      "expected": "ptsd",
      "predicted": "The patient presents with a profound sense of emotional distress, marked by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, indicating a significant loss of pleasure in activities they once enjoyed. They report ongoing feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>guilt</sym>, and emotional numbness, which suggest the presence of <med>major depressive symptoms</med>. Additionally, trauma-related symptoms are prominent, including intrusive <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and heightened <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, especially in response to cues associated with the recent <med>traumatic event</med>. The individual exhibits <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as steering clear of driving and situations that trigger anxiety, along with somatic complaints like headaches and muscle pains related to trauma reminders. They also describe dissociative experiences, feeling numb or disconnected from themselves and their surroundings, which further complicates their clinical picture. Anxiety symptoms, including increased <sym>startle response</sym> and panic-like reactions, are evident. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships are also notable, along with passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, indicating significant distress and functional impairment. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex interplay of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, and dissociative features, requiring careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> is supported by the patient's trauma-related symptoms, including intrusive memories, nightmares, hyperarousal, avoidance, and dissociative experiences, all of which align with the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. The presence of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a significant depressive component, warranting a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feeling numb and disconnected, are common in trauma-related disorders and suggest a dissociative subtype or features within PTSD. The overlap of symptoms and the trauma history justify a diagnosis that encompasses both PTSD and depression, with attention to the dissociative phenomena contributing to overall impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE), to address trauma-related symptoms.  \n2. Consider psychiatric evaluation for pharmacotherapy, including antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) to target depressive and PTSD symptoms.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses and dissociation, and develop safety and stabilization strategies.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place, given the passive thoughts of self-harm.  \n5. Coordinate care with a trauma specialist if available, and consider referrals for additional support, such as group therapy or trauma support groups.",
