Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. We will go through 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Your sleep has been troubled, with <quote>sleeping less than usual and waking up frequently</quote>, and you\u2019ve noticed problems with <sym>memory</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation or detachment</sym>. There are also concerns about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>distressing images</sym> that keep coming back, which suggest possible obsessive or compulsive symptoms. Additionally, you report <quote>headaches, back aches, and feeling dismissed when discussing health issues</quote>. Your use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications indicates some maladaptive coping strategies, and the presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlights the need for careful monitoring. Overall, your symptoms reflect a deeply difficult experience with overlapping mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic concerns, which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Moderate to Severe, with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <quote>loss of interest and feelings of hopelessness</quote>, alongside significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as <quote>persistent nervousness and panic episodes</quote>. Sleep disturbances and cognitive impairments, including <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and dissociative experiences, further support a mood disorder with anxiety features.

The reports of <quote>self-harm thoughts</quote> without current intent warrant careful safety planning. The combination of mood, anxiety, and obsessive features points toward a complex but identifiable mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, rather than solely somatic symptom disorder, although somatic complaints are present.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed psychiatric history, mental status exam, and screening for suicidality and safety.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, which can target depression, anxiety, and obsessive symptoms.  \n3. Refer to a mental health specialist (psychiatrist or psychologist) for further evaluation, including possible cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address depressive, anxious, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use issues through psychoeducation and motivational interviewing, and consider a referral to addiction counseling if appropriate.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely, especially the risk of self-harm, and develop a safety plan with the patient.  \n6. Explore psychoeducation and support for sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and overall functioning.",

Concurrently, there are significant anxiety features characterized by generalized nervousness (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9). Sleep disturbance is evident, with reports of insomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), alongside cognitive difficulties such as impaired memory and disorientation (Q16). The patient also describes psychomotor agitation or restlessness with elevated energy levels despite limited sleep (Q5), suggestive of possible mixed features.\n\nFurthermore, the patient endorses recurrent distressing intrusive thoughts and images (Q17), compulsive checking behaviors (Q18), and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (Q19), pointing towards possible obsessive-compulsive or dissociative symptomatology. Somatic complaints including unexplained headaches and back aches (Q10) are noted, along with concerns about feeling dismissed regarding health issues (Q11).\n\nSubstance use behaviors include significant alcohol consumption (Q22), cigarette smoking (Q23), and non-prescribed medication misuse (Q24), which could serve as maladaptive coping strategies and pose additional health risks. The presence of suicidal ideation without current intent (Q12) warrants close monitoring.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include mood dysregulation, passive suicidal thoughts, substance misuse, and dissociative experiences. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection (Q19, Q21) further compound clinical concern.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation is characterized by pervasive depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognitive and somatic complaints, dissociative experiences, and maladaptive substance use. These findings suggest a complex psychiatric picture requiring comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of ongoing emotional and physical difficulties. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. At the same time, you\u2019re dealing with significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <quote>feeling nervous, worried, and on edge</quote>, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Your sleep has been troubled, with <quote>sleeping less than usual and waking up frequently</quote>, and you\u2019ve noticed problems with <sym>memory</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation or detachment</sym>. There are also concerns about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>distressing images</sym> that keep coming back, which suggest possible obsessive or compulsive symptoms. Additionally, you report <quote>headaches, back aches, and feeling dismissed when discussing health issues</quote>. Your use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications indicates some maladaptive coping strategies, and the presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlights the need for careful monitoring. Overall, your symptoms reflect a deeply difficult experience with overlapping mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic concerns, which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Moderate to Severe, with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <quote>loss of interest and feelings of hopelessness</quote>, alongside significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as <quote>persistent nervousness and panic episodes</quote>. Sleep disturbances and cognitive impairments, including <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and dissociative experiences, further support a mood disorder with anxiety features. Recurrent intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking, and feelings of disconnection suggest the presence of <med>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</med>. The reports of <quote>self-harm thoughts</quote> without current intent warrant careful safety planning. The combination of mood, anxiety, and obsessive features points toward a complex but identifiable mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology, rather than solely somatic symptom disorder, although somatic complaints are present.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed psychiatric history, mental status exam, and screening for suicidality and safety.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, which can target depression, anxiety, and obsessive symptoms.  \n3. Refer to a mental health specialist (psychiatrist or psychologist) for further evaluation, including possible cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address depressive, anxious, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use issues through psychoeducation and motivational interviewing, and consider a referral to addiction counseling if appropriate.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely, especially the risk of self-harm, and develop a safety plan with the patient.  \n6. Explore psychoeducation and support for sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and overall functioning.",
