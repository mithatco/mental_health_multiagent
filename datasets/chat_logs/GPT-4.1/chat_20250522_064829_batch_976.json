Today, we will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad picture of your mental health across different areas. This helps us understand what you're experiencing and how we can best support you. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various aspects of mental health, and I will ask you each one in turn. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just tell me how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

You've shared experiences of persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which indicate significant emotional pain. You've also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> that interfere with your daily life. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty sleeping and frequent awakenings, along with cognitive issues like forgetfulness and disorientation, add to your distress. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, all of which suggest a complex mental health picture involving mood, anxiety, and possibly obsessive-compulsive features. Your substance use, including alcohol and cigarettes, as well as non-prescribed medications, raises concern about maladaptive coping strategies, and your social withdrawal further impacts your well-being. It is understandable that managing these symptoms feels overwhelming, and acknowledging their presence is a crucial step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder and features of Obsessive-Compulsive and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, anhedonia, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> aligns with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of intense <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and hyperarousal symptoms suggest a comorbid <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> point towards obsessive-compulsive tendencies and dissociative features, which may be part of an <med>OCD</med> spectrum or related anxiety pathology. Cognitive issues like forgetfulness and disorientation could be related to the severity of mood and anxiety symptoms or potential neurocognitive impairment. The patient's substance use, especially alcohol and tobacco, as well as misuse of medications, may be serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms, complicating the clinical picture. Overall, the symptoms indicate a complex, multifaceted mental health condition requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity and history of <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and assess for any risk of <sym>suicide</sym> or <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed approaches), and consider pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, anxiolytics) as appropriate.  \n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and support for reducing alcohol, tobacco, and medication misuse.  \n4. Monitor and manage sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if needed, medical interventions.  \n5. Include support for cognitive concerns and dissociative symptoms, possibly involving neurocognitive evaluation if symptoms persist.  \n6. Ensure close safety planning and risk management given active suicidal thoughts.",

Key symptoms include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, as evidenced by dark thoughts and a desire to escape emotional pain. There are prominent features of anxiety, including heightened worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding crowds), and hyperarousal. Sleep disturbances are apparent, characterized by insomnia, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and difficulty achieving restful sleep. Cognitive impairment is suggested by increased forgetfulness and occasional disorientation. The patient reports psychomotor agitation or restlessness, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive behaviors such as checking rituals, which may reflect underlying obsessive-compulsive tendencies or heightened anxiety. Dissociative experiences, including depersonalization and derealization, are noted, alongside feelings of identity confusion and detachment from self and surroundings.\n\nThe patient endorses maladaptive coping strategies, including substance use\u2014specifically alcohol and cigarettes\u2014and self-medication with non-prescribed medications, which pose additional clinical concerns. There is also evidence of social withdrawal and strained interpersonal relationships.\n\nRisk factors of note include active suicidal ideation with some intent, recent substance use exceeding recommended limits, and potential substance misuse. The presence of hallucination-like paranoia, although not auditory or visual hallucinations, warrants attention for possible psychotic features or severe anxiety.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests a complex comorbidity of mood disorder (likely depression), anxiety spectrum symptoms, neurocognitive concerns, and substance use disorder. The severity of suicidal thoughts and substance misuse warrants careful risk assessment and a comprehensive treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You are clearly going through a very challenging time with a wide range of intense and distressing symptoms. You've shared experiences of persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which indicate significant emotional pain. You've also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> that interfere with your daily life. Sleep disturbances, such as difficulty sleeping and frequent awakenings, along with cognitive issues like forgetfulness and disorientation, add to your distress. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, all of which suggest a complex mental health picture involving mood, anxiety, and possibly obsessive-compulsive features. Your substance use, including alcohol and cigarettes, as well as non-prescribed medications, raises concern about maladaptive coping strategies, and your social withdrawal further impacts your well-being. It is understandable that managing these symptoms feels overwhelming, and acknowledging their presence is a crucial step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder and features of Obsessive-Compulsive and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, anhedonia, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> aligns with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of intense <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and hyperarousal symptoms suggest a comorbid <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> point towards obsessive-compulsive tendencies and dissociative features, which may be part of an <med>OCD</med> spectrum or related anxiety pathology. Cognitive issues like forgetfulness and disorientation could be related to the severity of mood and anxiety symptoms or potential neurocognitive impairment. The patient's substance use, especially alcohol and tobacco, as well as misuse of medications, may be serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms, complicating the clinical picture. Overall, the symptoms indicate a complex, multifaceted mental health condition requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity and history of <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and assess for any risk of <sym>suicide</sym> or <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed approaches), and consider pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, anxiolytics) as appropriate.  \n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and support for reducing alcohol, tobacco, and medication misuse.  \n4. Monitor and manage sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if needed, medical interventions.  \n5. Include support for cognitive concerns and dissociative symptoms, possibly involving neurocognitive evaluation if symptoms persist.  \n6. Ensure close safety planning and risk management given active suicidal thoughts.",
