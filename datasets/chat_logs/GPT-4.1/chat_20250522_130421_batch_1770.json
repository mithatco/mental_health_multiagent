We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get an overall picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to understand how you're doing emotionally, physically, and in your daily functioning, so we can better plan any support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The process will involve me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You mentioned <sym>crying for no reason</sym> and feeling <sym>anxious most of the time</sym>, with worries about your future and feelings of restlessness.

Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> are common for you, and you've expressed feelings of <sym>disconnection from loved ones and a sense of being lost</sym>. You have had <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are important to address carefully. Overall, it sounds like you are going through a very difficult time, experiencing significant emotional distress, and feeling quite isolated and overwhelmed.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Somatic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>crying</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, restlessness, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> suggest significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>, consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The ongoing sleep disturbances and somatic complaints may also reflect the somatic manifestation of emotional distress, but without evidence of medically unexplained symptoms that are disproportionate or excessive, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is less likely. The passive <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicate a risk that warrants careful monitoring and intervention. The overall presentation suggests a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, impacting multiple areas of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and ensure ongoing monitoring.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focused on mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressant medications</med>, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Address sleep hygiene and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n6. Explore social support options and encourage gradual re-engagement with valued activities and relationships.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",

The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants careful risk assessment. Dissociative experiences and social withdrawal further suggest significant emotional distress. The symptom profile indicates a probable mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation and safety planning.",

While the symptoms may resemble an adjustment reaction, the specified diagnosis is mood and anxiety disorders rather than an adjustment disorder, which typically involves a maladaptive response to a stressor without meeting criteria for major depression or anxiety disorders.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>feeling of flatness and loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>overwhelming sadness</sym>. You mentioned <sym>crying for no reason</sym> and feeling <sym>anxious most of the time</sym>, with worries about your future and feelings of restlessness. You also described <sym>difficulty sleeping, waking up at night, and feeling tired during the day</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> are common for you, and you've expressed feelings of <sym>disconnection from loved ones and a sense of being lost</sym>. You have had <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are important to address carefully. Overall, it sounds like you are going through a very difficult time, experiencing significant emotional distress, and feeling quite isolated and overwhelmed.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Somatic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>crying</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, restlessness, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> suggest significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>, consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The ongoing sleep disturbances and somatic complaints may also reflect the somatic manifestation of emotional distress, but without evidence of medically unexplained symptoms that are disproportionate or excessive, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> is less likely. The passive <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicate a risk that warrants careful monitoring and intervention. The overall presentation suggests a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, impacting multiple areas of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and ensure ongoing monitoring.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focused on mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressant medications</med>, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Address sleep hygiene and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n6. Explore social support options and encourage gradual re-engagement with valued activities and relationships.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",
