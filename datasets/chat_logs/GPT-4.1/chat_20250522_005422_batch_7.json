Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a set of questions designed to give us a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. This assessment can help us identify areas that may need further attention or support. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The process involves me asking you 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It\u2019s clear that you are feeling overwhelmed by persistent <sym>depressive</sym> feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, which have left you feeling numb and disconnected. You also described episodes of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, along with impulsive behaviors and engagement in risky activities, which seem to be your way of coping with these intense feelings. Your sleep difficulties, memory problems, and feelings of dissociation\u2014such as feeling detached or watching yourself from outside\u2014are significant and suggest that your mental health challenges are affecting multiple areas of your life. The thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and your use of substances and medications without medical guidance highlight the urgency of addressing your safety and well-being. It\u2019s understandable to feel lost or unsure of who you are right now, given all that you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use</med> concerns\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors further support comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>, <sym>depersonalization</sym>, and feelings of lost identity indicate dissociative phenomena, which often occur in response to trauma or severe stress and can be associated with mood or trauma-related disorders. The report of <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications, suggests maladaptive coping strategies that may exacerbate the overall clinical picture. The cognitive symptoms, such as memory impairment and disorientation, along with the emotional detachment, point toward a complex interplay of mood, dissociative, and substance-related factors. Given the range of symptoms and their impact, a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with mixed features and comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms is appropriate.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk, substance use severity, and possible underlying trauma or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Develop a multidisciplinary treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-focused therapy), medication management for depression and anxiety, and substance use treatment.  \n3. Address safety concerns related to <sym>self-harm</sym> thoughts and substance misuse, possibly involving crisis intervention or closer monitoring.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Consider neurocognitive testing to evaluate memory and cognitive difficulties and tailor interventions accordingly.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant affective disturbance and possible comorbidities. Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), persistent feelings of hopelessness, and episodic thoughts of self-harm, suggesting depressive features. The patient reports marked irritability, impulsivity, and increased engagement in risky activities, alongside heightened anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance, consistent with anxiety and mood dysregulation. Cognitive complaints include memory impairment and disorientation, which may warrant further neurocognitive assessment. The patient's reports of derealization or depersonalization episodes, emotional detachment, and a sense of lost identity point toward dissociative phenomena. Behavioral indicators include increased substance use\u2014particularly alcohol and cigarettes\u2014as maladaptive coping mechanisms, and recent use of non-prescribed medications, raising concern for substance misuse and potential self-medication. The presence of intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors (e.g., repeated checking) further suggest underlying obsessive-compulsive or ruminative processes.\n\nPattern Analysis:\n- Symptom overlap across mood, anxiety, and dissociative domains.\n- Evidence of mood instability, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation.\n- Significant sleep disturbance and fatigue.\n- Substance use as a maladaptive coping strategy.\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including dissociation and memory issues.\n\nPotential Clinical Significance:\n- Major depressive symptoms with possible comorbid anxiety and dissociative features.\n- Elevated risk for self-harm given thoughts of hurting oneself and substance misuse.\n- Functional impairment related to cognitive difficulties and social withdrawal.\n- Substance use concerns, including non-prescribed medication use, which may complicate clinical management.\n\nRisk Factors / Warning Signs:\n- Presence of suicidal ideation (thoughts of hurting oneself).\n- Substance misuse, including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications.\n- Dissociative experiences and feelings of depersonalization.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors.\n- Sleep disturbances and fatigue, contributing to overall functional decline.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive symptoms, anxiety, dissociative phenomena, cognitive impairments, and substance use. These findings warrant comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning to address underlying mood and anxiety pathology, assess suicide risk, and evaluate substance use behaviors.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging and complex set of experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are feeling overwhelmed by persistent <sym>depressive</sym> feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, which have left you feeling numb and disconnected. You also described episodes of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, along with impulsive behaviors and engagement in risky activities, which seem to be your way of coping with these intense feelings. Your sleep difficulties, memory problems, and feelings of dissociation\u2014such as feeling detached or watching yourself from outside\u2014are significant and suggest that your mental health challenges are affecting multiple areas of your life. The thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and your use of substances and medications without medical guidance highlight the urgency of addressing your safety and well-being. It\u2019s understandable to feel lost or unsure of who you are right now, given all that you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use</med> concerns\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors further support comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>, <sym>depersonalization</sym>, and feelings of lost identity indicate dissociative phenomena, which often occur in response to trauma or severe stress and can be associated with mood or trauma-related disorders. The report of <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications, suggests maladaptive coping strategies that may exacerbate the overall clinical picture. The cognitive symptoms, such as memory impairment and disorientation, along with the emotional detachment, point toward a complex interplay of mood, dissociative, and substance-related factors. Given the range of symptoms and their impact, a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with mixed features and comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms is appropriate.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk, substance use severity, and possible underlying trauma or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Develop a multidisciplinary treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-focused therapy), medication management for depression and anxiety, and substance use treatment.  \n3. Address safety concerns related to <sym>self-harm</sym> thoughts and substance misuse, possibly involving crisis intervention or closer monitoring.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Consider neurocognitive testing to evaluate memory and cognitive difficulties and tailor interventions accordingly.",
