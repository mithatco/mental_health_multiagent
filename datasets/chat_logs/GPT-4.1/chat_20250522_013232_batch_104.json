This is a tool we use to get a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. The purpose of this assessment is to better understand your current mental health state and identify any areas that may need further attention. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this space is safe for you to be honest. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different aspects of mental health, and I'll be asking you each one in turn. There's no rush, and you can take your time.

Your sleep has been disrupted, waking very early and feeling exhausted despite sleeping enough hours. You also experience <sym>physical aches</sym> and <sym>difficulties with concentration and memory</sym>, along with <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> where things sometimes feel unreal or distant.

You've been dealing with ongoing worry and avoidance, which seem to contribute to your overall distress. These symptoms are impacting your mood, thoughts, physical health, and daily functioning, and I want to acknowledge how hard it must be to manage all of this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with Anxiety Features and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over a few weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>early morning awakening</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient also exhibits symptoms of <med>generalized anxiety</med>, including persistent worry, avoidance behaviors, and social discomfort. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling <quote>like I\u2019m watching myself from outside</quote>, are indicative of dissociative symptoms, which can occur in severe depression or anxiety disorders. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> without active suicidal intent are notable but do not meet criteria for suicidality at this time. Overall, the constellation of mood, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative symptoms suggests a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any risk factors, including suicidality.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, tailored to the patient's needs and tolerability.  \n4. Monitor for worsening symptoms, especially any increase in <sym>death thoughts</sym> or emergence of <sym>suicidal plans</sym>.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical interventions.  \n6. Explore the possibility of additional support, such as social connection and stress management techniques, to help reduce feelings of isolation.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia (Q2), persistent feelings of hopelessness and depression (Q3), and psychomotor exhaustion (Q5), with reports of early morning awakening and difficulty resuming sleep, contributing to overall fatigue. Cognitive concerns are evident through reported concentration and memory impairments (Q16), alongside feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (Q19), which may suggest dissociative symptoms or emotional numbing.\n\nAnxious features are noted by reports of generalized worry (Q7), social avoidance (Q9), and situational anxiety (Q7), with some avoidance behaviors in social contexts. The patient also reports physical symptoms, including unexplained aches and pains (Q10), which may be somatic manifestations of underlying psychological distress.\n\nThoughts of death or self-harm (Q12) are present without explicit suicidal intent or plans, representing an important risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring. The patient denies hallucinations, paranoid ideation, or substance misuse, and reports social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities, further supporting a depressive diagnosis with comorbid anxiety features.\n\nPatterns of concern include:\n- Mood symptoms: depression, hopelessness\n- Anhedonia and social withdrawal\n- Sleep disturbance: early awakening, non-restorative sleep\n- Cognitive impairment: concentration and memory issues\n- Somatic complaints: aches, pains\n- Dissociative experiences\n- Anxiety and avoidance behaviors\n- Passive death thoughts without active suicidal plans\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance:\n- Major depressive disorder, possibly with features of melancholia or atypical features\n- Generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety\n- Dissociative symptoms warranting further exploration\n- Somatic symptom disorder considerations\n- Monitoring for emerging suicidality given the presence of death-related thoughts\n\nRisk factors/ warning signs:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and death ideation\n- Social isolation and withdrawal\n- Chronic sleep disruption and fatigue\n- Physical complaints without clear medical etiology\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms with co-occurring anxiety and dissociative features, accompanied by somatic complaints and passive death thoughts. These findings underscore the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, safety assessment, and tailored treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a lot about your current experience, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very challenging time. You\u2019re feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>lost</sym>, with a persistent sense of <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>disinterest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. Your sleep has been disrupted, waking very early and feeling exhausted despite sleeping enough hours. You also experience <sym>physical aches</sym> and <sym>difficulties with concentration and memory</sym>, along with <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> where things sometimes feel unreal or distant. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <quote>lost</quote> and lacking a clear sense of yourself or what you want, and have been withdrawing from social connections. Additionally, you\u2019ve had <quote>thoughts about death</quote>, though not with intent or plans to harm yourself. You've been dealing with ongoing worry and avoidance, which seem to contribute to your overall distress. These symptoms are impacting your mood, thoughts, physical health, and daily functioning, and I want to acknowledge how hard it must be to manage all of this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with Anxiety Features and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over a few weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>early morning awakening</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient also exhibits symptoms of <med>generalized anxiety</med>, including persistent worry, avoidance behaviors, and social discomfort. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling <quote>like I\u2019m watching myself from outside</quote>, are indicative of dissociative symptoms, which can occur in severe depression or anxiety disorders. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> without active suicidal intent are notable but do not meet criteria for suicidality at this time. Overall, the constellation of mood, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative symptoms suggests a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any risk factors, including suicidality.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, tailored to the patient's needs and tolerability.  \n4. Monitor for worsening symptoms, especially any increase in <sym>death thoughts</sym> or emergence of <sym>suicidal plans</sym>.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical interventions.  \n6. Explore the possibility of additional support, such as social connection and stress management techniques, to help reduce feelings of isolation.",
