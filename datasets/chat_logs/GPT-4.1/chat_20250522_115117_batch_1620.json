Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different domains, and I will ask each one carefully. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand how you've been feeling. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

Cognitive complaints, dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling numb</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym>, support the consideration of dissociative features often seen in mood and anxiety disorders. While physical symptoms are acknowledged, they seem secondary to psychological distress, and medical evaluations did not reveal significant organic causes. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and overall distress heighten clinical concern for risk, requiring careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and assess risk level, especially regarding suicidal thoughts.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Develop a safety plan with the patient to address passive suicidal thoughts and ensure support during crises.  \n5. Incorporate psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and consider referrals for additional support, such as support groups or psychiatric consultations.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia (A2), feelings of hopelessness and being overwhelmed (A3), and social withdrawal with decreased enjoyment of relationships (A21). There is a notable presence of anxiety symptoms, including pervasive worry (A7), panic attacks (A8), and avoidance behaviors in response to panic and social anxiety (A9). Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in non-restorative sleep (A5, A15). Cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness and disorientation (A16) are also reported, alongside intrusive ruminative thoughts (A17).\n\nThe patient reports dissociative experiences, including feelings of numbness or detachment (A19), and uncertainty about personal identity and future goals (A20). Physical symptoms, including headaches and stomach pains, are acknowledged, with reassurance of medical evaluation ruling out significant medical etiology. The absence of substance use (A22-A24) is noted.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a constellation of depressive symptoms coupled with generalized anxiety disorder features, including panic disorder and agoraphobic avoidance. The presence of passive suicidal ideation without active plans warrants clinical attention.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and despair\n- Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors\n- Dissociative symptoms\n- Intrusive ruminations and cognitive disorganization\n- Social withdrawal and relational disconnection\n- Passive suicidal ideation\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and cognitive concerns, with potential implications for increased risk of self-harm. A comprehensive assessment, including risk evaluation and diagnostic clarification, is recommended to inform targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult experience with persistent <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>overwhelm</sym> that have been affecting your daily life. Your increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> suggest you\u2019re going through significant emotional distress. You also described ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> about health and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which seem to be quite intense and disruptive. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking during the night, along with <sym>cognitive concerns</sym> like forgetfulness, add to your challenges. Your feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about your identity</sym> indicate a complex mix of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms. Despite these struggles, you are reaching out and sharing your experiences, which is a positive step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> (such as feelings of numbness and detachment).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, aligning with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive complaints, dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling numb</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym>, support the consideration of dissociative features often seen in mood and anxiety disorders. While physical symptoms are acknowledged, they seem secondary to psychological distress, and medical evaluations did not reveal significant organic causes. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and overall distress heighten clinical concern for risk, requiring careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and assess risk level, especially regarding suicidal thoughts.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Develop a safety plan with the patient to address passive suicidal thoughts and ensure support during crises.  \n5. Incorporate psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and consider referrals for additional support, such as support groups or psychiatric consultations.",
