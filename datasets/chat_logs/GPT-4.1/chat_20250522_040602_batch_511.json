You mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> most of the time, avoiding social events out of fear of judgment, and experiencing <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> such as a racing heart when confronted with social exposure. You also described persistent worries about making mistakes and feeling disconnected from yourself at times. It\u2019s understandable that these feelings impact your mood, sleep, and overall sense of well-being, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>social anxiety disorder</med>, including intense fear and avoidance of social situations due to worries about negative evaluation, and physical symptoms such as <sym>panic sensations</sym>. The pervasive avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and emotional distress align with this diagnosis. Additionally, reports of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> suggest a concomitant <med>major depressive episode</med>. No evidence of psychosis, dissociative symptoms, or substance misuse was found, but the mood and anxiety symptoms are prominent and impairing.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity and impact on functioning.  \n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety and depression.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for both social anxiety and depression.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and provide safety planning as appropriate.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about anxiety and depression to foster understanding and engagement in treatment.  \n7. Consider involving supportive network members or family in treatment planning, if appropriate.",

Key concerns include pervasive social avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness, particularly related to social interactions. The patient reports significant behavioral inhibition, including avoidance of social situations, and heightened distress characterized by worry about negative evaluation and self-criticism. Mood symptoms such as anhedonia, hopelessness, and occasional passive suicidal thoughts are evident. \n\nCognitive and perceptual domains appear intact, with no reported psychotic symptoms or dissociative episodes. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep and nocturnal awakenings with anxiety, are present. The patient exhibits mild memory lapses suggestive of stress-related impairment. Somatic complaints, notably headaches and stomach discomfort, are temporally linked to social stressors. There is a history of transient panic-like sensations associated with social exposure, indicating situational panic components.\n\nPatterns of responses reveal a consistent avoidance and fear of social scrutiny, with underlying social anxiety likely contributing to feelings of loneliness and identity confusion. The absence of substance use or disordered compulsive behaviors is noted.\n\n**Potential clinical significance includes:**\n- Social anxiety disorder with significant functional impairment\n- Depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and hopelessness\n- Anxiety-related sleep disturbance\n- Passive suicidal ideation warranting monitoring\n- No evidence of psychosis or dissociative disorders\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Expressions of hopelessness and dark thoughts, albeit without active plans\n- Avoidance behaviors that may lead to social isolation\n- Panic sensations linked to social situations\n- Feelings of confusion regarding self-identity\n\n**Overall,** the patient's symptom profile aligns with social anxiety disorder compounded by depressive features. Continued assessment of suicidality, functional impairment, and potential comorbidities is recommended to inform targeted intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about your experiences, and it\u2019s clear that you're dealing with significant challenges related to social anxiety, which affects how you feel, think, and behave in social situations. You mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> most of the time, avoiding social events out of fear of judgment, and experiencing <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> such as a racing heart when confronted with social exposure. You also described persistent worries about making mistakes and feeling disconnected from yourself at times. It\u2019s understandable that these feelings impact your mood, sleep, and overall sense of well-being, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>social anxiety disorder</med>, including intense fear and avoidance of social situations due to worries about negative evaluation, and physical symptoms such as <sym>panic sensations</sym>. The pervasive avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, and emotional distress align with this diagnosis. Additionally, reports of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> suggest a concomitant <med>major depressive episode</med>. No evidence of psychosis, dissociative symptoms, or substance misuse was found, but the mood and anxiety symptoms are prominent and impairing.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity and impact on functioning.  \n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety and depression.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for both social anxiety and depression.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and provide safety planning as appropriate.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about anxiety and depression to foster understanding and engagement in treatment.  \n7. Consider involving supportive network members or family in treatment planning, if appropriate.",
