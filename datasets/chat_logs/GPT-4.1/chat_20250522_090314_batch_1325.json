This questionnaire is designed to help us get a comprehensive view of your mental health across different areas, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. The purpose is to better understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks so we can discuss any concerns you might have and consider appropriate support. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, and I appreciate your honesty.

Additionally, there are concerning behaviors such as <sym>substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and misuse of prescription medication</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Your feelings of <sym>disconnection from yourself and others, and confusion about your identity</sym> suggest significant psychological distress that warrants careful attention. Your experiences reflect a multifaceted clinical picture that requires a compassionate and comprehensive approach.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Disorder and features of Dissociative Symptoms, coupled with Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Symptoms such as <sym>feelings of dissociation, feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings</sym> indicate dissociative features, which can occur with mood and anxiety disorders under significant stress. The reported <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and misuse of prescription medication\u2014raises concern about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to or exacerbating the mental health symptoms. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and substance use points to a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess risk of self-harm, and evaluate substance use severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm risk</sym>.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) and, if indicated, pharmacotherapy.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use</med> and consider referral to addiction treatment services if appropriate.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions, and consider medical evaluation for somatic symptoms.  \n6. Establish ongoing mental health support, including crisis resources if needed, and monitor symptoms regularly to adjust treatment as necessary.",

There is evidence of increased irritability, heightened anxiety, and panic episodes, alongside behavioral changes such as increased risk-taking and hyperactivity. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by decreased duration, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns are noted, with reports of impaired memory and occasional disorientation. The patient reports intrusive thoughts, compulsive-like behaviors (repetitive checking and mental routines), and dissociative experiences, suggesting symptoms of dissociation or derealization. Psychosomatic complaints include unexplained aches and pains, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Additionally, the patient exhibits substance use behaviors, including recent alcohol consumption, regular cigarette smoking, and misuse of prescription medication without medical supervision, representing potential substance use concerns and associated risk factors.\n\nPattern analysis reveals concurrent mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable agitation, impulsivity, and dissociation, alongside self-harm ideation, which warrants immediate clinical attention. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement further compound clinical complexity. Risk factors include suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and impulsive behaviors, all of which elevate the need for comprehensive safety planning and intervention.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of affective, anxiety, dissociative, and behavioral symptoms consistent with a mood disorder possibly compounded by anxiety and substance use issues. The presence of suicidal thoughts and substance misuse underscores the importance of urgent safety assessment and integrated treatment planning.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the 23 DSM-5 Level 1 domains, including mood, anger, anxiety, somatic concerns, suicidality, psychosis, sleep, memory, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. However, some domains like mania and repetitive thoughts/behaviors were only superficially covered or not explored in depth beyond the initial question. For example, the question about manic symptoms was only briefly touched upon with the patient denying psychosis or hallucinations, but no follow-up or probing about elevated mood, grandiosity, or increased activity was conducted, which are key in assessing mania. Similarly, repetitive thoughts and behaviors were addressed with some follow-up, but without detailed exploration. Overall, the conversation is comprehensive but slightly superficial in fewer domains, leading to a high but not perfect score.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions posed by the therapist closely mirror DSM-5 criteria for each domain, with appropriate language and clinical terminology. The phrasing is clear and targeted. Minor issues include some questions that could be more precise\u2014for example, asking about 'feeling more irritated' rather than explicitly probing for irritability symptoms outlined in DSM-5. Additionally, the therapist did not rephrase or clarify questions when the patient reported complex symptoms, which could have improved clinical accuracy. Nonetheless, the overall alignment with DSM-5 criteria is strong and appropriate for clinical assessment.",
        "consistency": "The conversation maintains a logical flow, with each question building on the responses provided. The therapist follows up appropriately on significant disclosures, such as the patient's suicidal thoughts, substance use, and dissociative feelings. There are slight moments where transitions could be smoother\u2014for example, moving from anxiety to somatic concerns without explicitly linking them\u2014but these do not significantly disrupt the dialogue. The overall coherence and natural progression support a high score, though some minor lapses in seamless flow prevent a perfect rating.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Symptoms, and Substance Use Disorder is well-supported by the patient's symptom reports. The clinician explicitly links symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, panic, dissociation, and substance use to DSM-5 criteria. However, the reasoning lacks detailed differential diagnosis considerations\u2014for example, ruling out bipolar disorder (given the elevated, risky behaviors and decreased sleep) or other mood disorders. The justification is generally sound but somewhat superficial, lacking in-depth exploration of symptom severity, duration, and differential diagnoses. A more nuanced discussion would merit a higher score.",
        "empathy": "The therapist exhibits a warm, professional tone, acknowledges the patient's disclosures, and creates a safe space for sharing. The responses are empathetic, with affirmations like 'thank you for sharing' and 'I understand,' which promote rapport. However, there are moments where the responses could demonstrate greater warmth or validation\u2014such as explicitly acknowledging the patient's distress or fear\u2014rather than primarily focusing on information gathering. While overall professional and empathetic, the interaction could be more personalized and emotionally attuned to reach the highest rating."

      "overall_comments": "This simulated conversation demonstrates a strong and generally comprehensive assessment aligned well with DSM-5 criteria. The therapist covers most domains thoroughly, maintains a logical flow, and uses clinically relevant language. The diagnostic reasoning is appropriate but not deeply nuanced, and some DSM-5 areas such as mania and repetitive thoughts are only superficially explored. Empathy and professionalism are evident but could be enhanced with more personalized validation. Overall, this conversation would benefit from deeper probing into certain symptoms and more explicit differential diagnosis considerations. It merits a score of 4 across most criteria, reflecting excellent but not flawless assessment quality.",

Your feelings of <sym>disconnection from yourself and others, and confusion about your identity</sym> suggest significant psychological distress that warrants careful attention. Your experiences reflect a multifaceted clinical picture that requires a compassionate and comprehensive approach.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Disorder and features of Dissociative Symptoms, coupled with Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Symptoms such as <sym>feelings of dissociation, feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings</sym> indicate dissociative features, which can occur with mood and anxiety disorders under significant stress. The reported <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and misuse of prescription medication\u2014raises concern about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to or exacerbating the mental health symptoms. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and substance use points to a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess risk of self-harm, and evaluate substance use severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm risk</sym>.  \n3.
