Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn.

You've also described feeling quite <sym>irritable and angry easily</sym>, along with <sym>significant anxiety, worry, and panic attacks</sym>. Sleep problems are affecting you, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, and you also experience <sym>physical pains such as headaches and back pain</sym>. You\u2019ve noticed issues with memory and feelings of dissociation, like feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you mentioned <sym>intrusive negative thoughts, compulsive checking behaviors</sym>, and feelings of being lost or confused about who you are and what you want. You also report <sym>suicidal thoughts, thoughts of harming yourself</sym>, and ongoing substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication with prescription drugs. Your experiences reflect considerable distress across mood, anxiety, dissociative, and behavioral domains, which require careful clinical attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Symptoms, with indications of suicidal ideation and substance use disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and sleep disturbance</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, along with symptoms of memory impairment and identity confusion, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> possibly related to trauma or severe stress. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts without current intent or plan</sym> emphasizes the importance of safety assessment. Substance use\u2014alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription medication misuse\u2014may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms and require integrated intervention. The broad range of symptoms across mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use indicates a complex clinical picture warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and suicide risk, including safety planning as necessary.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, tailored to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist to manage mood and anxiety symptoms, and evaluate the need for treatment of substance use.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about the interplay of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use, and offer support for developing coping strategies.\n5. Arrange for ongoing monitoring of symptoms, substance use, and safety, with possible involvement of a multidisciplinary team if needed.",

Notable features include pervasive low mood characterized by anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, alongside irritability and irritability-related difficulties controlling anger. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by persistent worry, panic attacks with associated physical sensations, and avoidance behaviors targeting anxiety-provoking situations. Sleep disturbances are reported, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, contributing to overall fatigue and physical tension, as evidenced by unexplained headaches and back pain.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are evident, with reports of memory impairments, dissociative episodes (feeling detached from self and surroundings), and confusion about identity and life goals. Intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts and compulsive-like checking behaviors suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features. Additionally, the patient endorses suicidal ideation without active plans, raising concern for ongoing self-harm risk.\n\nSubstance use behaviors include daily cigarette smoking, episodic alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits, and self-medication with prescription medications without medical oversight, which may compound mental health symptoms and pose additional health risks.\n\nPattern analysis indicates a persistent mood disorder co-occurring with anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and possible substance misuse. The presence of suicidal thoughts, impulsivity, and substance use are clinical warning signs necessitating immediate attention. The patient's subjective sense of being misunderstood and feelings of disconnection from others and self further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits complex, overlapping symptoms suggestive of major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder and dissociative features, compounded by substance use and self-harm ideation. These findings underscore the need for a comprehensive clinical evaluation, safety planning, and integrated intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a wide range of difficult feelings and thoughts over the past two weeks. You mention persistent <sym>low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy</sym>. You've also described feeling quite <sym>irritable and angry easily</sym>, along with <sym>significant anxiety, worry, and panic attacks</sym>. Sleep problems are affecting you, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, and you also experience <sym>physical pains such as headaches and back pain</sym>. You\u2019ve noticed issues with memory and feelings of dissociation, like feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you mentioned <sym>intrusive negative thoughts, compulsive checking behaviors</sym>, and feelings of being lost or confused about who you are and what you want. You also report <sym>suicidal thoughts, thoughts of harming yourself</sym>, and ongoing substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication with prescription drugs. Your experiences reflect considerable distress across mood, anxiety, dissociative, and behavioral domains, which require careful clinical attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Symptoms, with indications of suicidal ideation and substance use disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and sleep disturbance</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, along with symptoms of memory impairment and identity confusion, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> possibly related to trauma or severe stress. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts without current intent or plan</sym> emphasizes the importance of safety assessment. Substance use\u2014alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription medication misuse\u2014may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms and require integrated intervention. The broad range of symptoms across mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use indicates a complex clinical picture warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and suicide risk, including safety planning as necessary.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, tailored to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist to manage mood and anxiety symptoms, and evaluate the need for treatment of substance use.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about the interplay of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use, and offer support for developing coping strategies.\n5. Arrange for ongoing monitoring of symptoms, substance use, and safety, with possible involvement of a multidisciplinary team if needed.",
