This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health by asking about different symptoms you've experienced over the past two weeks. It's a confidential process, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We will go through 23 questions covering different domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and I encourage you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

You mention persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. Your irritability, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate significant anxiety and mood instability. You also describe <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, which are concerning perceptual and cognitive symptoms often associated with psychosis. Additionally, your reports of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> point toward complex emotional and physical distress. Your substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and non-prescribed medications, further complicates your mental health. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are overwhelming, and I want to acknowledge your bravery in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Bipolar Spectrum Features</med> and <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of decreased sleep with increased energy and engagement in risky behaviors suggests episodes of <med>hypomania</med> or <med>mania</med>, indicating a possible <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym> are indicative of <med>psychotic features</med>, which can occur in mood episodes or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. The dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties further point to a complex presentation involving mood instability, psychosis, and possibly trauma-related or dissociative features. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy that may exacerbate mood and psychotic symptoms. Overall, these findings suggest a mood disorder with psychotic features, likely on the bipolar spectrum, requiring careful assessment and management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnosis, including mood episodes, psychotic features, and substance use impact.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm risks</sym>.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, potentially including mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Provide psychotherapy focused on mood stabilization, managing psychotic symptoms, and developing healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling, support groups, or referral to specialized addiction services.  \n6. Consider involving a multidisciplinary team, including medical providers, to evaluate and treat physical symptoms and comorbid conditions.",

Symptomatology indicative of affective dysregulation includes reports of elevated energy levels with decreased sleep, engagement in risky behaviors, and heightened activity levels, suggestive of possible hypomanic or manic episodes. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, racing thoughts, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors leading to social withdrawal and isolation.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are evident, including auditory and thought broadcasting phenomena, as well as dissociative experiences such as feeling detached from oneself and perceiving reality as unreal. These symptoms raise concern for psychotic-like experiences. Additionally, the patient reports somatic complaints, including unexplained aches, pains, and cognitive difficulties like memory impairment and disorientation.\n\nSubstance use patterns are noteworthy, with regular alcohol consumption exceeding standard limits and daily tobacco use, compounded by non-prescribed use of medications and self-medication strategies, indicating potential substance misuse and maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nRisk factors of clinical concern include:\n- Suicidal ideation (thoughts of self-harm)\n- Psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, thought broadcasting)\n- Mood episodes with possible bipolar features\n- Substance misuse\n- Social withdrawal and interpersonal difficulties\n- Dissociative symptoms and cognitive impairment\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests a complex psychiatric profile with mood instability, psychotic features, anxiety features, and substance use issues that warrant comprehensive evaluation, risk assessment, and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of experiences that suggest you are going through a very challenging time. You mention persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. Your irritability, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate significant anxiety and mood instability. You also describe <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, which are concerning perceptual and cognitive symptoms often associated with psychosis. Additionally, your reports of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> point toward complex emotional and physical distress. Your substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and non-prescribed medications, further complicates your mental health. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are overwhelming, and I want to acknowledge your bravery in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Bipolar Spectrum Features</med> and <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of decreased sleep with increased energy and engagement in risky behaviors suggests episodes of <med>hypomania</med> or <med>mania</med>, indicating a possible <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym> are indicative of <med>psychotic features</med>, which can occur in mood episodes or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. The dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties further point to a complex presentation involving mood instability, psychosis, and possibly trauma-related or dissociative features. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy that may exacerbate mood and psychotic symptoms. Overall, these findings suggest a mood disorder with psychotic features, likely on the bipolar spectrum, requiring careful assessment and management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnosis, including mood episodes, psychotic features, and substance use impact.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm risks</sym>.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, potentially including mood stabilizers and antipsychotics, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Provide psychotherapy focused on mood stabilization, managing psychotic symptoms, and developing healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling, support groups, or referral to specialized addiction services.  \n6. Consider involving a multidisciplinary team, including medical providers, to evaluate and treat physical symptoms and comorbid conditions.",
