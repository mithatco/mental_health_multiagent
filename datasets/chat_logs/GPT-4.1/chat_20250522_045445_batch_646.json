There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just tell me how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

They describe persistent anxiety, including generalized worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, indicative of heightened social and environmental sensitivity. Cognitive complaints include memory impairment and disorientation in familiar settings. There are reports of intrusive negative thoughts and occasional images, with feelings of derealization or depersonalization. The patient also reports somatic symptoms such as unexplained headaches and muscle tension.\n\nPatterns observed include fluctuating sleep disturbances\u2014hypersomnia during depressive episodes and decreased sleep during past hypomanic states\u2014suggesting mood variability. While current mood appears more stabilized, residual anxiety and depressive features persist. The patient admits to passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plans, and occasional alcohol use as a maladaptive coping mechanism. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions is present, and substance misuse appears minimal.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass major depressive features with possible underlying bipolarity given episodic mood fluctuations, comorbid anxiety disorder, and cognitive impairment. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants close monitoring. The patient's social withdrawal, feelings of disconnection, and somatic complaints further support the need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and possible mood disorder management.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts, anxiety-related avoidance, and somatic symptoms. No current overt suicidal intent or active plan is reported, but ongoing assessment is recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a complex mixture of symptoms over the past two weeks, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym/anhedonia>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you normally enjoy. You also described a sense of <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>exhaustion</sym> despite sleeping more than usual, along with feelings of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that sometimes escalate into <sym>panic episodes</sym>. Cognitive concerns such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and feelings of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> have been prominent, and you mentioned <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle tension. You also noted some <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without intent, and occasional <sym>alcohol use</sym> as a coping mechanism. It appears you're going through a challenging period marked by mood variability, anxiety, and physical discomfort, which is understandably distressing. Your feelings of disconnection and questioning of your identity suggest a significant impact on your sense of self and relationships, and these experiences deserve careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (possibly Bipolar II or Cyclothymic Disorder)</med> and comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and cognitive disturbances, all lasting at least two weeks, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, episodic increases in <sym>energy</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym> during past hypomanic states suggest underlying <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance behaviors, indicates a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants close monitoring but does not indicate active intent. The ongoing mood fluctuations, combined with cognitive and somatic symptoms, point toward a mood disorder with bipolar features, complicated by anxiety and somatic complaints.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including mood disorder assessment and screening for bipolarity, to clarify diagnosis.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as mood stabilizers or antidepressants, tailored to mood stability and symptom severity.  \n3. Incorporate psychotherapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and cognitive distortions.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation regularly and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Address somatic symptoms with medical evaluation to rule out underlying physical conditions.  \n6. Consider referral to a psychiatrist specializing in bipolar disorders for ongoing management and medication adjustment.",
