Today, we will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, thoughts, and behaviors. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I'd appreciate your honest and detailed responses. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past couple of weeks. These include persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which suggest some degree of <med>depressive symptoms</med>. You also described feeling <sym>anxious, on edge, and worried</sym> frequently, especially in social situations, leading to avoidance of social gatherings and difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts. You mentioned experiencing <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as headaches and stomachaches linked to your anxiety, and you have had <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about hurting yourself, though without specific plans. Your experiences of transient panic feelings and thoughts of rejection or judgment contribute to your social withdrawal and sense of isolation. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant emotional distress impacting your social functioning and well-being, and your honesty in sharing these feelings is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> and <med>Suicidal Ideation (passive)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive worry, anxious feelings especially in social contexts, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The presence of persistent low interest, feelings of hopelessness, and occasional dark thoughts align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The recent <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without plans indicate a risk that warrants attention. The combination of anxious and depressive symptoms, along with social withdrawal and sleep disturbance, suggests a comorbid presentation requiring integrated treatment. The absence of psychotic features and no evidence of dissociation or severe cognitive impairment further supports this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk, and formulate an individualized treatment plan.  \n2. Consider starting psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focused on anxiety management, social skills, and mood regulation.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to address anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Develop a safety plan to monitor and support the patient regarding suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and crisis resources.  \n5. Encourage engagement in social activities gradually and promote healthy sleep hygiene.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",

There are also reports of low anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. The patient reports recent suicidal ideation without concrete plans, which warrants careful monitoring due to associated risk factors.\n\nPhysical complaints include somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches correlated with anxious states, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating sleep and racing thoughts. Cognitive concerns are minimal, with no significant memory deficits or dissociative experiences noted.\n\nPattern analysis indicates significant avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal, coupled with persistent anxious rumination and intrusive negative thoughts about self-worth and rejection. The patient endorses feelings of being on edge and experiences of fleeting panic-like sensations, though without full-blown panic attacks. Substance use appears minimal, and there are no indicators of disordered substance use.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include social anxiety disorder, comorbid depression, and active suicidal ideation. The patient's presentation suggests a complex interplay of anxiety and mood symptoms with associated somatic and cognitive features, underscoring the need for comprehensive assessment and safety planning.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include reported suicidal thoughts, social isolation, and anxiety-driven avoidance, all of which merit ongoing risk assessment and intervention considerations. Overall, the clinical picture reflects significant emotional distress impacting social functioning and quality of life, requiring targeted therapeutic strategies.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past couple of weeks. These include persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which suggest some degree of <med>depressive symptoms</med>. You also described feeling <sym>anxious, on edge, and worried</sym> frequently, especially in social situations, leading to avoidance of social gatherings and difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts. You mentioned experiencing <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as headaches and stomachaches linked to your anxiety, and you have had <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about hurting yourself, though without specific plans. Your experiences of transient panic feelings and thoughts of rejection or judgment contribute to your social withdrawal and sense of isolation. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant emotional distress impacting your social functioning and well-being, and your honesty in sharing these feelings is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> and <med>Suicidal Ideation (passive)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive worry, anxious feelings especially in social contexts, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The presence of persistent low interest, feelings of hopelessness, and occasional dark thoughts align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The recent <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without plans indicate a risk that warrants attention. The combination of anxious and depressive symptoms, along with social withdrawal and sleep disturbance, suggests a comorbid presentation requiring integrated treatment. The absence of psychotic features and no evidence of dissociation or severe cognitive impairment further supports this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk, and formulate an individualized treatment plan.  \n2. Consider starting psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focused on anxiety management, social skills, and mood regulation.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to address anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Develop a safety plan to monitor and support the patient regarding suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and crisis resources.  \n5. Encourage engagement in social activities gradually and promote healthy sleep hygiene.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
