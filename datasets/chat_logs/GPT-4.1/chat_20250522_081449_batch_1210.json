We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your current mental health symptoms. The purpose of this assessment is to identify any areas that might need further attention or support. Please know that everything we discuss is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share openly. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks, and your honest responses will help guide any next steps. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also reported somatic symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and a sense that others don't fully understand your struggles.

The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about everything falling apart (Q17) and compulsive checking behaviors (Q18) indicate possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The dissociative feelings (Q19) and sense of confusion about identity (Q20) further support this, though these may also be part of a mood or anxiety disorder spectrum. The absence of <sym>auditory or visual hallucinations</sym> (Q13, Q14) and no evidence of psychosis reduce the likelihood of primary psychotic disorders. The overall pattern suggests a complex presentation with overlapping mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to confirm diagnostic clarity, assess risk of <sym>suicidality</sym>, and explore the severity and impact of symptoms.\n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n3. Consider a <med>psychiatric evaluation</med> for potential medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, tailored to symptom profile.\n4. Address somatic complaints with medical evaluation to rule out physical causes and incorporate stress management techniques.\n5. Establish a strong support system and safety plan, especially given reports of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and feelings of hopelessness.\n6.

There is a notable presence of anxiety symptoms characterized by excessive worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggestive of comorbid Anxiety Disorder. The patient reports cognitive disturbances evidenced by forgetfulness (Q16), and intrusive negative ruminative thoughts centered around apocalyptic imagery (Q17). Somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches (Q10) further support the somatic manifestation of psychological distress.\n\nPatterns indicate a combination of mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, with emotional numbness or dissociation (Q19), feelings of identity confusion (Q20), and social disconnection. Although thoughts of self-harm are acknowledged (Q12), no active intent or plan is indicated. Substance use appears minimal, with no current use of alcohol or tobacco (Q22, Q23). \n\nPotential clinical concerns include significant depressive symptomatology with associated anxiety features, cognitive impairments, and risk factors for suicidality given reported dark thoughts and feelings of hopelessness. The patient's social withdrawal and emotional disengagement suggest potential social isolation and diminished functioning. The presence of somatic symptoms warrants consideration of medical evaluation to rule out physical causes or the contribution of stress-related somatic complaints.\n\nOverall, these responses indicate a complex presentation of mood and anxiety symptoms with cognitive and somatic components, necessitating a comprehensive assessment for mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and suicidality, as well as evaluation of safety and support systems.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are currently experiencing a wide range of difficult feelings and thoughts. You've described persistent <sym>depressive</sym> feelings of <quote>hopelessness</quote> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>\u2014loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. You're also dealing with <sym>fatigue</sym> despite sleeping more than usual, along with <sym>feelings of being stuck and unmotivated</sym>. Anxiety seems to be a significant part of your experience, with constant <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance of social situations. You mentioned <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness and intrusive <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about everything falling apart, as well as feelings of dissociation or being detached from yourself and your surroundings. Despite these overwhelming symptoms, you acknowledged thoughts of self-harm but clarified there is no current plan or intent. You also reported somatic symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and a sense that others don't fully understand your struggles. Overall, it\u2019s clear you're going through a very challenging time with complex emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms that are significantly affecting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> comorbid with <med>Anxiety Disorder (likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med> and features of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts), along with dissociative experiences.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q2), <sym>fatigue despite hypersomnia</sym> (Q5), <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q3), and social withdrawal (Q21) align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym> (Q7), <sym>panic episodes</sym> (Q8), and avoidance (Q9), suggest a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about everything falling apart (Q17) and compulsive checking behaviors (Q18) indicate possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The dissociative feelings (Q19) and sense of confusion about identity (Q20) further support this, though these may also be part of a mood or anxiety disorder spectrum. The absence of <sym>auditory or visual hallucinations</sym> (Q13, Q14) and no evidence of psychosis reduce the likelihood of primary psychotic disorders. The overall pattern suggests a complex presentation with overlapping mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to confirm diagnostic clarity, assess risk of <sym>suicidality</sym>, and explore the severity and impact of symptoms.\n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n3. Consider a <med>psychiatric evaluation</med> for potential medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, tailored to symptom profile.\n4. Address somatic complaints with medical evaluation to rule out physical causes and incorporate stress management techniques.\n5. Establish a strong support system and safety plan, especially given reports of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and feelings of hopelessness.\n6. Regular follow-up to monitor response to treatment, safety, and any emerging concerns.",
