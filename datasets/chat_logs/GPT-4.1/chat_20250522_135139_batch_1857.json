At the same time, you've experienced <sym>periods of elevated energy</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, including starting multiple projects and engaging in risky behaviors, which suggests <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. You've also described <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoiding situations that trigger worry. Physical symptoms such as headaches and back pain seem to accompany these mood changes. You\u2019ve mentioned occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> during low phases, but no active intent or plans. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex pattern of mood instability with both depressive and manic features, along with anxiety symptoms, which warrants careful clinical consideration.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features, and comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with pervasive feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, alongside periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The fluctuating nature of these episodes, including manic/hypomanic and depressive phases, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoiding stressful situations, suggests a comorbid anxiety component. The physical complaints and occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> during low periods further reinforce the need for a comprehensive treatment plan. This pattern of mood episodes with mixed features fits the diagnostic criteria, and no psychotic symptoms were reported, making <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> the most fitting primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and course of mood episodes.\n2. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood swings and reduce the risk of relapse.\n3. Consider adding an antidepressant or antianxiety medication if appropriate, while monitoring closely for mood destabilization.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and the importance of medication adherence and regular monitoring.\n5. Offer psychotherapy options, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage symptoms, improve coping strategies, and address comorbid anxiety.\n6. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish crisis intervention resources.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor mood stability, medication effects, and overall functioning.",

The reported mood disturbances are characterized by episodes of depression and elevated mood or \"high phases,\" suggesting a possible bipolar spectrum disorder. During manic or hypomanic episodes, the patient reports decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and engagement in risky behaviors such as impulsive spending and initiating multiple projects. Conversely, depressive periods involve hypersomnia, cognitive fog, and feelings of disconnection.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are also evident, with reports of pervasive worry, feeling on edge, and panic attacks. Physical complaints such as headaches and unexplained aches align with somatic manifestations often associated with mood and anxiety disorders. The patient admits to occasional suicidal thoughts during low periods but denies active plans or intent. There are no indications of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nPatterns reveal cyclical mood shifts with concurrent behavioral and cognitive changes, consistent with bipolar disorder. The patient\u2019s substance use appears limited to occasional smoking and episodic alcohol consumption, with no evidence of substance dependence or misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood instability, episodic impulsivity, subthreshold psychotic experiences (e.g., feelings of detachment), and risk factors related to suicidal ideation. The presence of both depressive and manic symptoms warrants careful diagnostic clarification and risk assessment.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture suggests a mood disorder with bipolar features, accompanied by comorbid anxiety symptoms. Further comprehensive assessment is recommended to confirm diagnosis, evaluate risk, and inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very detailed account of your experiences over the past few weeks. It sounds like you've been going through significant mood swings, with episodes of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>low energy</sym>. At the same time, you've experienced <sym>periods of elevated energy</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, including starting multiple projects and engaging in risky behaviors, which suggests <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. You've also described <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoiding situations that trigger worry. Physical symptoms such as headaches and back pain seem to accompany these mood changes. You\u2019ve mentioned occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> during low phases, but no active intent or plans. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex pattern of mood instability with both depressive and manic features, along with anxiety symptoms, which warrants careful clinical consideration.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features, and comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with pervasive feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, alongside periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The fluctuating nature of these episodes, including manic/hypomanic and depressive phases, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoiding stressful situations, suggests a comorbid anxiety component. The physical complaints and occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> during low periods further reinforce the need for a comprehensive treatment plan. This pattern of mood episodes with mixed features fits the diagnostic criteria, and no psychotic symptoms were reported, making <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> the most fitting primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and course of mood episodes.\n2. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood swings and reduce the risk of relapse.\n3. Consider adding an antidepressant or antianxiety medication if appropriate, while monitoring closely for mood destabilization.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and the importance of medication adherence and regular monitoring.\n5. Offer psychotherapy options, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage symptoms, improve coping strategies, and address comorbid anxiety.\n6. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish crisis intervention resources.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor mood stability, medication effects, and overall functioning.",
