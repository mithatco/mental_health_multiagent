This tool helps us understand different areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. The purpose is to get a broad picture of how you've been feeling and functioning recently, which can guide us in providing the best support. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various domains, and I will ask each one in order. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just answer based on how you've experienced things over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question about mood?"

Despite these intense symptoms, you do not have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>hallucinations</sym>.

The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, or significant disorganized behavior indicates these are not current features of psychosis or severe mood disorder, although ongoing distress warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on anxiety management, including techniques for reducing worry and panic symptoms.  \n2. Consider medication evaluation for possible use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other anxiolytics to help manage anxiety and panic episodes.  \n3. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress reduction activities, such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises.  \n4. Schedule follow-up to monitor symptom progression and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, adjusting treatment as needed.",

They report persistent anxious feelings, frequent intrusive negative thoughts, and somatic manifestations such as muscle tension and stomach discomfort. The patient also experiences episodic panic attacks characterized by intense fear, tachycardia, and perceived loss of control, alongside avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded situations. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, leading to daytime fatigue. There are reports of emotional numbing, dissociative feelings, and a sense of emotional detachment, suggesting features of depersonalization or derealization.\n\nPatterns indicate a high level of internalized distress, with symptoms spanning anxiety, mood dysregulation, and somatic concerns. The patient exhibits signs of impulsivity and increased irritability, alongside social withdrawal and feelings of being lost or disconnected from their identity and life direction. Notably, there are no indications of suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, or psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and features of mood disturbance, possibly depressive in nature. The dissociative experiences and feelings of emotional numbness warrant further assessment for comorbid dissociative symptoms or trauma-related conditions. The absence of substance use and self-harm risk factors is noted, but ongoing anxiety and mood symptoms merit close monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits significant internal distress with multifaceted anxiety symptoms, mood symptoms, and somatic complaints, requiring targeted intervention and further diagnostic clarification.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing significant distress over the past two weeks, including pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about many aspects of your life such as work and health. You mentioned feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym>, <sym>irritable</sym>, and <sym>snapping at others</sym>, along with difficulty <sym>sleeping</sym> and feeling <sym>restless</sym>. You also described episodes of <sym>panic</sym> with physical symptoms like a racing heart and difficulty breathing, which you find quite frightening. In addition, you experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>muscle tension</sym>, and feelings of <sym>detachment or numbness</sym>. Despite these intense symptoms, you do not have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>hallucinations</sym>. You noted feeling <sym>lost</sym> about your sense of identity and <sym>withdrawn</sym> from social connections. These symptoms suggest a complex picture of significant anxiety with mood and somatic components, impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with features of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and possible <med>Depressive Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent and pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including excessive worry about multiple domains, along with <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by physical sensations of intense fear, are consistent with <med>GAD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and feelings of <sym>numbness or dissociation</sym> also suggest comorbid <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The somatic complaints such as <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>stomach discomfort</sym> further support the diagnosis, but do not solely point to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> as the primary issue. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, or significant disorganized behavior indicates these are not current features of psychosis or severe mood disorder, although ongoing distress warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on anxiety management, including techniques for reducing worry and panic symptoms.  \n2. Consider medication evaluation for possible use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other anxiolytics to help manage anxiety and panic episodes.  \n3. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress reduction activities, such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises.  \n4. Schedule follow-up to monitor symptom progression and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, adjusting treatment as needed.",
