Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking during the night, are also affecting you, as well as concerns about <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and disorientation.

Although you have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, you have not acted on them. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant level of distress that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with prominent anxiety features and dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your presentation includes core features of <med>major depression</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low energy</sym>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, indicates comorbid anxiety symptoms.

Your sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support this clinical picture. No evidence suggests psychotic symptoms or substance use disorder at this time. The overall presentation aligns most closely with a depressive disorder with prominent anxiety and dissociative features, but further assessment is necessary for definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for potential trauma history or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with psychoeducation about sleep hygiene.  \n3. Discuss the potential use of pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n4. Implement safety planning and regular monitoring of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, with involvement of supportive persons or crisis resources if needed.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of mood disturbance, anxiety, and trauma-related features. Key concerns include persistent anhedonia and low motivation, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and significant anxiety characterized by pervasive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. The patient reports sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and disorientation, which may be exacerbated by anxiety. Recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like checking behaviors suggest the presence of obsessive features. Experiences of dissociation and self-questioning indicate potential identity-related or depersonalization symptoms. The patient also endorses passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent, warranting careful monitoring. Social withdrawal and emotional distancing are evident, with decreased engagement in relationships. Substance use appears limited, with minimal alcohol consumption and no tobacco or illicit drug use reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Symptomatology aligns with major depressive features (anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy), combined with significant anxiety and panic symptoms.\n- Presence of dissociative experiences and identity questioning may suggest comorbid trauma or dissociative phenomena.\n- Sleep disruption and cognitive complaints are notable and may contribute to overall functional impairment.\n- Passive suicidal ideation, without active plans, indicates elevated risk requiring ongoing assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and occasional suicidal thoughts necessitate vigilant monitoring.\n- Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors increase risk for functional impairment and social isolation.\n- Dissociative symptoms and identity questioning could reflect underlying trauma or dissociative processes.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient's presentation reflects a complex clinical picture featuring depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptom clusters, with notable cognitive and sleep disturbances. The reported passive suicidal ideation underscores the importance of safety planning and ongoing evaluation. These findings suggest the need for a comprehensive assessment to delineate diagnostic considerations and tailor appropriate interventions.",

        "clinical_relevance": "The questions asked closely align with DSM-5 criteria, and the language used is generally clear and appropriate. The therapist accurately reflects symptom content, such as sleep disturbances, panic, dissociation, and suicidal thoughts. Minor issues include a lack of probing for certain symptoms like anger or mania, and some questions could be more precise (e.g., the question about unexplained aches could specify location or severity). Overall, questions are relevant and clinically appropriate, but some could be enhanced for precision.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flows logically when addressing each symptom area, with appropriate follow-up questions based on patient responses. However, there are minor lapses\u2014such as the sudden shift from physical symptoms to dissociation without explicit linking\u2014and some areas (e.g., substance use) are briefly addressed without further probing. The dialogue is cohesive but not perfectly seamless, and some responses could prompt deeper exploration. Overall, the flow is generally good but not flawless.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The clinician provides a reasonable synthesis linking symptoms to the proposed diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode with anxiety and dissociative features. However, the justification is somewhat superficial; it does not thoroughly differentiate between possible diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder, trauma-related disorders, or psychosis spectrum conditions. The reasoning references patient symptoms but lacks detailed linkage to DSM-5 criteria or exploration of differential diagnoses. The explanation is generally sound but could be more explicit and comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional tone, demonstrates understanding, and affirms the patient's disclosures with empathetic comments (e.g., 'That must be really frightening,' or 'Thank you for sharing that'). The responses are warm and respectful, fostering rapport. Nevertheless, there are few moments where the empathy could be more explicitly expressed or tailored to the patient's emotional state. Overall, the tone remains supportive and professional, with minor room for increased warmth."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates solid coverage of many relevant DSM-5 symptom domains, with questions generally aligned to clinical criteria and a respectful, professional tone. However, it falls short of comprehensive assessment across all DSM-5 dimensions\u2014particularly missing deeper exploration of anger, mania, psychosis, and personality functioning. The diagnostic reasoning is appropriate but somewhat superficial, lacking detailed differential analysis. The flow is coherent but not entirely seamless, and some areas, such as substance use and dissociation, could benefit from more probing. Overall, this is a strong, competent assessment with room for improvement in breadth, depth, and diagnostic rigor. A score of 4 across most categories would be appropriate, with the exception of dsm_coverage and diagnostic justification, which merit a 3 due to notable gaps and superficial reasoning.",

You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>low motivation</sym>, alongside persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking during the night, are also affecting you, as well as concerns about <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and disorientation. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>dissociated</sym> at times and questioning your <sym>identity</sym>, which can be quite unsettling. Although you have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, you have not acted on them. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant level of distress that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with prominent anxiety features and dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your presentation includes core features of <med>major depression</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low energy</sym>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, indicates comorbid anxiety symptoms. You also report <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feeling detached and questioning your <sym>identity</sym>, which could suggest dissociative phenomena often associated with trauma or severe stress. Your sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support this clinical picture. No evidence suggests psychotic symptoms or substance use disorder at this time. The overall presentation aligns most closely with a depressive disorder with prominent anxiety and dissociative features, but further assessment is necessary for definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for potential trauma history or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with psychoeducation about sleep hygiene.  \n3. Discuss the potential use of pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n4. Implement safety planning and regular monitoring of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, with involvement of supportive persons or crisis resources if needed.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.",
