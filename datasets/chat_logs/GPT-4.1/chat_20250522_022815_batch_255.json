This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers symptoms like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others, to give a broad picture of how you're feeling. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports significant mood disturbances characterized by anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and decreased interest in previously enjoyed activities, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, there are notable anxiety features, including pervasive worry, heightened irritability, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments, indicating social anxiety or generalized anxiety components. The patient exhibits episodic panic attacks with physical sensations of breathlessness and loss of control, alongside persistent feelings of being on edge, which may reflect panic or acute anxiety episodes.\n\nSleep disturbance is evident, with frequent nocturnal awakenings and difficulty maintaining sleep, contributing to overall fatigue. Cognitive concerns include mild memory lapses and disorientation, though these are reported as minor. The presence of intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors such as repetitive handwashing and checking, strongly suggests obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Derealization episodes, characterized by feeling detached from oneself and surroundings, further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nThe patient denies psychotic phenomena, substance misuse, or recent alcohol consumption exceeding moderate intake, and reports no current suicidal ideation or intent. However, expressed feelings of overwhelm and passive thoughts of self-harm warrant careful assessment.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms with obsessive-compulsive features.\n- Symptoms of hyperarousal (irritability, sleep disturbance, hypervigilance).\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances (derealization, mild forgetfulness).\n- Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without intent, requiring ongoing monitoring.\n- Significant functional impairment related to mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n- Episodes of panic with somatic symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized and panic anxiety features, and prominent obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The derealization and cognitive concerns further suggest dissociative elements. The symptomatology warrants a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, considering mood disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and dissociative features, with particular attention to suicidality and functional impairment.",

      "predicted": "You have shared with me a range of difficult feelings and experiences that have been affecting you over the past two weeks. It sounds like you are struggling with <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and loss of interest in activities that once brought you joy</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable, anxious, and on edge, with episodes of panic that are quite intense</sym>. Sleep has been disrupted, and you sometimes feel <sym>derealization, as if you are outside of yourself or disconnected from your surroundings</sym>. You\u2019ve described having <sym>intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive rituals like handwashing and checking</sym>. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re experiencing a complex mix of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, which can be very overwhelming and distressing. Please know that your feelings are valid, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with Obsessive-Compulsive and Anxiety Features, Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports core symptoms of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness</sym>, which align with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry, irritability, sleep disturbances, and panic episodes</sym> suggests significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. The recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive rituals such as handwashing and checking</sym>, point toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Additionally, episodes of <sym>derealization and feeling disconnected from oneself or the environment</sym> indicate dissociative features. These symptoms collectively suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, which often co-occur and can exacerbate each other\u2019s severity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation** to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and rule out other potential conditions.  \n2. **Start evidence-based treatment**, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. **Consider pharmacotherapy**, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), which can help alleviate depression, reduce obsessive thoughts, and manage anxiety.  \n4. **Address sleep disturbances** with sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if appropriate.  \n5. **Monitor for suicidality and passive self-harm thoughts**, providing safety planning and crisis support as needed.  \n6. **Explore additional support**, such as support groups or psychoeducation about symptoms, to foster understanding and resilience.  \n7. **Schedule follow-up sessions** to evaluate treatment response and adjust plans accordingly.",
