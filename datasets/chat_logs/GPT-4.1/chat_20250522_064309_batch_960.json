Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. You're free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with, and there are no right or wrong answers. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

Additionally, you've described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, along with avoidance of certain situations that trigger your nervousness. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>difficulties falling asleep and waking up frequently</sym>. You also reported engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and using substances like alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational drugs, which may be affecting your overall well-being. Feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself and your surroundings</sym> and occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are concerning and warrant careful attention. It\u2019s understandable that these experiences are overwhelming, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> components.

The somatic complaints and dissociative feelings further support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, with risk factors for self-harm. The combination of symptoms aligns with a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Anxiety and Substance Use Disorders</med>, but further assessment is needed to clarify the full diagnostic picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and identify any underlying trauma or additional comorbidities.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy), medication management (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents), and substance use counseling.  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n4. Provide safety planning and ongoing monitoring for self-harm risk, including support networks and crisis resources.  \n5. Explore possible underlying stressors or trauma and incorporate trauma-informed approaches if relevant.",

Key symptoms include pervasive low mood and anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and intrusive thoughts, suggestive of depressive features. Concurrently, there are prominent anxiety symptoms characterized by persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. The patient reports elevated irritability, increased energy levels with decreased sleep, and engagement in impulsive or risky activities, consistent with mood instability potentially indicative of episodic mood dysregulation.\n\nNotable patterns include somatic complaints (headaches, muscle tension) and dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and surroundings), alongside cognitive concerns such as feelings of confusion about identity and purpose. The patient reports difficulties with sleep quality and intrusive, recurrent disturbing thoughts. Substance use is notable, with frequent alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits, daily cigarette smoking, and recent use of non-prescribed medications and recreational drugs, heightening risk factors for substance-related complications and self-harm.\n\nWarning signs of concern include passive thoughts of self-harm, feelings of hopelessness, and substance use behaviors that may increase risk for adverse outcomes. The presence of dissociative symptoms, impulsivity, and mood lability warrants careful monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient presents with a complex presentation involving depressive, anxiety, and substance use symptoms, with potential mood dysregulation and dissociative features. Further assessment is recommended to delineate diagnostic criteria, evaluate risk, and inform targeted intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and behaviors. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>disconnected from things you used to enjoy</sym> and a persistent <sym>low mood and hopelessness</sym>, which suggests significant depressive symptoms. Additionally, you've described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, along with avoidance of certain situations that trigger your nervousness. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>difficulties falling asleep and waking up frequently</sym>. You also reported engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and using substances like alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational drugs, which may be affecting your overall well-being. Feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself and your surroundings</sym> and occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> are concerning and warrant careful attention. It\u2019s understandable that these experiences are overwhelming, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> components. The report of <sym>impulsive risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym> (alcohol, cigarettes, recreational drugs), and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> suggest concurrent <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> and possibly features of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive or Dissociative Disorders</med>. The somatic complaints and dissociative feelings further support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, with risk factors for self-harm. The combination of symptoms aligns with a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Anxiety and Substance Use Disorders</med>, but further assessment is needed to clarify the full diagnostic picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and identify any underlying trauma or additional comorbidities.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy), medication management (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents), and substance use counseling.  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n4. Provide safety planning and ongoing monitoring for self-harm risk, including support networks and crisis resources.  \n5. Explore possible underlying stressors or trauma and incorporate trauma-informed approaches if relevant.",
