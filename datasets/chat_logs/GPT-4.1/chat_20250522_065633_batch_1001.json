Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to look at different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, energy, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and you can answer as honestly as you feel comfortable. Are you ready to begin?"

The chronic worry, physical tension, and difficulty relaxing support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts indicates a moderate risk that requires careful monitoring. The cognitive issues, such as memory difficulties and occasional disorientation, may be related to sleep deprivation or the overall mood and anxiety symptoms. The absence of psychotic features or substance misuse suggests these are primary mood and anxiety-related conditions rather than other psychiatric or medical illnesses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms, safety concerns, and potential underlying medical conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts and establish a safety plan.\n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies, sleep hygiene education, or medical evaluation.\n6. Encourage regular physical activity, social engagement, and stress reduction techniques.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant affective and anxiety-related distress. Key concerns include pervasive low mood characterized by anhedonia and hopelessness, alongside irritability and heightened emotional reactivity. The patient reports persistent anxiety, worry, and physical sensations of tension, including muscle aches and restlessness, suggestive of generalized anxiety features. Sleep disturbances are notable, involving difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, which may exacerbate mood and cognitive issues.\n\nCognitive and perceptual concerns are minimal; the patient denies hallucinations, delusional thoughts, or derealization experiences. However, reports of memory difficulty and occasional disorientation suggest possible cognitive impact, potentially related to emotional distress or sleep deprivation.\n\nSignificant risk factors include passive suicidal ideation without active intent or plans, as well as feelings of emotional disconnection from close others, which may impair social support. The absence of substance misuse (alcohol, tobacco, drugs) and lack of psychotic symptoms are noted. The patient's recent behavioral changes\u2014such as increased risk-taking and compulsive checking\u2014may reflect impulsivity or underlying mood instability.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture is consistent with moderate to severe depressive symptoms interwoven with generalized anxiety features. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants close monitoring, and the patient's functional impairment in social connectedness and motivation is clinically relevant. Further assessment is recommended to clarify diagnostic considerations, evaluate safety, and determine appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You appear to be experiencing significant emotional distress characterized by <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which have impacted your ability to enjoy activities or feel connected to others. You've also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>emotional reactivity</sym>, along with pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> that often leave you feeling on edge. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, seem to exacerbate your feelings of exhaustion and difficulty concentrating. Physical symptoms such as muscle tension and stomachaches are present, and there have been moments of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>. Despite these intense symptoms, you deny hallucinations or delusional beliefs, and you report no current substance misuse.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and sleep disturbances are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The chronic worry, physical tension, and difficulty relaxing support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts indicates a moderate risk that requires careful monitoring. The cognitive issues, such as memory difficulties and occasional disorientation, may be related to sleep deprivation or the overall mood and anxiety symptoms. The absence of psychotic features or substance misuse suggests these are primary mood and anxiety-related conditions rather than other psychiatric or medical illnesses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms, safety concerns, and potential underlying medical conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts and establish a safety plan.\n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies, sleep hygiene education, or medical evaluation.\n6. Encourage regular physical activity, social engagement, and stress reduction techniques.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
