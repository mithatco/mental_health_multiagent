Address substance use through counseling or referral to specialized addiction services.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support.\n6.

Key mood symptoms include anhedonia, feelings of depression, hopelessness, and pervasive low mood. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, irritability, heightened tension, and episodes of panic, along with avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. The patient also reports sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with somatic complaints such as muscle aches and headaches, possibly indicative of tension or somatic preoccupations.\n\nPsychotic or perceptual disturbances are notably reported, including auditory hallucinations (\"hearing whispers or voices\") and paranoid experiences (\"thoughts being read\" or others perceiving their thoughts). Cognitive concerns are evident through reported forgetfulness and disorientation. Intrusive, distressing thoughts and compulsive behaviors\u2014such as repetitive checking or mental routines\u2014are also described, suggesting possible obsessive-compulsive features. Dissociative symptoms are present, with feelings of detachment from self and reality.\n\nThe patient admits to self-injurious ideation (\"dark thoughts\" about not waking up), substance use (alcohol exceeding moderate levels, regular cigarette smoking, and use of unprescribed medications), which constitute significant risk factors for harm. The acknowledgment of recent use of substances without medical oversight heightens concern for potential exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and safety risks.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture indicates a complex presentation characterized by mood disturbance, anxiety, psychotic phenomena, dissociative experiences, and substance use, with underlying risk for self-harm. These findings warrant comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and possibly urgent intervention depending on the severity and immediacy of risk.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex array of symptoms and experiences that reflect significant distress across multiple areas of your mental health. You describe persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about yourself. Anxiety is also prominent, with reports of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. You mention <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling and staying asleep, accompanied by physical symptoms such as <sym>muscle aches</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym>. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>hallucinations</sym> like hearing <sym>voices</sym>, and paranoid thoughts about <sym>thoughts being read</sym>. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings. Your mention of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about not waking up, along with recent <sym>substance use</sym> including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications, raises concerns about your safety and overall well-being. These symptoms suggest a complex mental health picture that needs careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>psychotic features</med> and co-occurring <med>anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices) and paranoid thoughts (e.g., <quote>thoughts being read</quote>) suggest <med>psychotic features</med> that are associated with depression in some cases. The pervasive anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors further complicate the clinical picture, indicating significant comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The physical symptoms, sleep disturbances, and intrusive thoughts also point toward a mood disorder with psychotic features, especially given the recent <sym>self-injurious ideation</sym>. Substance use adds risk and may exacerbate or maintain some symptoms, highlighting the need for integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, particularly regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. \n2. Develop a safety plan including monitoring and possibly inpatient care if immediate risk is high.\n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs) and <med>antipsychotic medication</med> if psychosis persists, along with <med>psychotherapy</med> tailored to depression and anxiety (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).\n4. Address substance use through counseling or referral to specialized addiction services.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support.\n6. Consider a referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and a psychologist or counselor for ongoing therapy.\n7. Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication side effects, and safety.",
