This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time, and you can answer in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Alongside these mood symptoms, you described experiencing <sym>increased irritability, social withdrawal, and avoiding crowded or public places due to anxiety</sym>. Your worries and constant sense of being <sym>on edge, with panic attacks that make you feel terrified and out of control</sym>. You also noted <sym>sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night</sym>, which contribute to feelings of exhaustion and cognitive problems like forgetfulness. You mentioned experiencing <sym>feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings, along with questioning your identity and purpose</sym>. Importantly, you expressed <sym>passive thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore, though without plans or intent to act on these thoughts</sym>. Overall, your symptoms involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, dissociation, sleep disturbance, and thoughts of self-harm.

The reports of <sym>persistent worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and feeling on edge</sym> suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms such as feeling detached from oneself and questioning identity</sym> indicates some dissociative features, which can sometimes be seen with severe anxiety or mood disorders. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties further support the depression diagnosis. The passive suicidal thoughts, though not accompanied by intent or plans, warrant careful attention. Overall, the combined symptom profile supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with Anxious Features</med>, considering the significant overlap with anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive clinical assessment:** Conduct a detailed evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and rule out other possible conditions such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related disorders.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address depression, anxiety, and maladaptive thought patterns.\n3. **Medication evaluation:** Refer to a psychiatrist for consideration of antidepressant medication, especially given the severity of symptoms and passive suicidal thoughts.\n4. **Safety planning:** Develop a safety plan to monitor and address suicidal ideation, ensuring immediate support if thoughts escalate.\n5. **Sleep and lifestyle interventions:** Educate on sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.\n6. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",

Concurrently, the patient reports significant anxiety features, including chronic worry, hypervigilance, and panic attacks with associated physical sensations of terror, as well as avoidance behaviors targeting crowded environments and public transportation. Somatic complaints include unexplained muscle tension, headaches, and sleep disturbances\u2014particularly insomnia and fragmented sleep\u2014contributing to daytime fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar settings.\n\nThe patient also reports dissociative experiences (feelings of detachment from self and surroundings) and identity questioning, which may suggest dissociative or depersonalization symptoms. Intrusive negative thoughts and recurrent distressing images are present, though compulsive behaviors are not indicated. Passive suicidal ideation is acknowledged without current plans or intent, warranting careful monitoring. No perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations or thought broadcasting are reported.\n\nPatterns of symptomatology include overlapping mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, with notable social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors. Substance use appears minimal, with limited alcohol consumption and no reported tobacco or non-prescribed medication misuse.\n\nPotential clinical significance involves comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, with risk factors including passive suicidal ideation and dissociative symptoms. The presentation warrants comprehensive assessment for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative phenomena. Continuous evaluation of suicidality and functional impairment is indicated.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex psychological profile marked by depressive symptoms, generalized and panic-related anxiety, dissociative experiences, sleep disruption, and passive suicidal thoughts, necessitating a thorough diagnostic workup and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very honest and detailed account of your current experience. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a difficult time, feeling <sym>persistent sadness, numbness, and a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless and stuck, with thoughts about whether things will improve</sym>. Alongside these mood symptoms, you described experiencing <sym>increased irritability, social withdrawal, and avoiding crowded or public places due to anxiety</sym>. Your worries and constant sense of being <sym>on edge, with panic attacks that make you feel terrified and out of control</sym>. You also noted <sym>sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night</sym>, which contribute to feelings of exhaustion and cognitive problems like forgetfulness. You mentioned experiencing <sym>feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings, along with questioning your identity and purpose</sym>. Importantly, you expressed <sym>passive thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore, though without plans or intent to act on these thoughts</sym>. Overall, your symptoms involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, dissociation, sleep disturbance, and thoughts of self-harm. I want to acknowledge how tough it must be to manage all of this, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a consistent <sym>low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym>, which align with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>persistent worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and feeling on edge</sym> suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms such as feeling detached from oneself and questioning identity</sym> indicates some dissociative features, which can sometimes be seen with severe anxiety or mood disorders. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties further support the depression diagnosis. The passive suicidal thoughts, though not accompanied by intent or plans, warrant careful attention. Overall, the combined symptom profile supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with Anxious Features</med>, considering the significant overlap with anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive clinical assessment:** Conduct a detailed evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and rule out other possible conditions such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related disorders.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address depression, anxiety, and maladaptive thought patterns.\n3. **Medication evaluation:** Refer to a psychiatrist for consideration of antidepressant medication, especially given the severity of symptoms and passive suicidal thoughts.\n4. **Safety planning:** Develop a safety plan to monitor and address suicidal ideation, ensuring immediate support if thoughts escalate.\n5. **Sleep and lifestyle interventions:** Educate on sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.\n6. **Follow-up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
