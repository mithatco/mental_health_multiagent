      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym> (loss of interest or pleasure), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also noticed increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially in social situations, where worries about <sym>embarrassment</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym> have been prominent. Your sleep has been disrupted with <sym>difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings</sym>, yet you still feel restless and full of energy. You also mentioned recurring <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about yourself and social situations, which seem to contribute to your withdrawal from social interactions. Physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym> are also present but appear to be occasional and not linked to any specific medical issue. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and negative ruminations that are impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym> related to social situations, including avoidance behaviors, worry about embarrassment, and panic-like episodes, indicates <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances characterized by <sym>insomnia and frequent awakenings</sym> are common in depression and anxiety states. The negative intrusive thoughts about social self-evaluation further support social anxiety features. The absence of suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or compulsive behaviors suggests these are not primary features of other disorders such as psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The physical symptoms are likely somatic manifestations of mood and anxiety symptoms rather than medical conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.  \n2. Consider initiating <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depressive and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, which are effective for depression and social anxiety.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or behavioral interventions.  \n5. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or increased anxiety, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n6. Consider consultation with a psychiatrist for medication management if indicated.",

They also endorse significant anxiety, particularly social anxiety characterized by worry about embarrassment, avoidance of social situations, and panic-like episodes in social contexts, indicating social anxiety features. Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of insomnia, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep despite elevated energy levels, which may suggest a mixed mood and anxiety presentation.\n\nNotably, the patient experiences recurrent negative intrusive thoughts related to social self-evaluation, contributing to feelings of worthlessness and social withdrawal. They deny suicidal ideation, self-harm, hallucinations, or delusional thoughts. There is no report of compulsive behaviors or dissociative symptoms. Physical complaints include occasional headaches and muscle aches, which may or may not be psychosomatic.\n\nPatterns observed include a combination of depressive and social anxiety symptoms, with avoidance behaviors and somatic complaints. The absence of substance misuse or medication misuse is noted, reducing immediate concern for substance-related issues.\n\nClinical significance centers on co-occurring mood and social anxiety symptoms, with potential impairments in social functioning and overall quality of life. The presence of panic episodes in social situations warrants attention to panic or agoraphobic features. Sleep disruption may exacerbate mood symptoms.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs are minimal; no suicidal ideation or self-harm is reported. However, ongoing social withdrawal and negative ruminations warrant further assessment for severity and potential risk of worsening mood or anxiety symptoms.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with moderate depressive symptoms, social anxiety features, sleep disturbance, and negative ruminations. These findings suggest a need for comprehensive evaluation and tailored intervention planning, considering both mood and anxiety domains.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym> (loss of interest or pleasure), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also noticed increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially in social situations, where worries about <sym>embarrassment</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym> have been prominent. Your sleep has been disrupted with <sym>difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings</sym>, yet you still feel restless and full of energy. You also mentioned recurring <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about yourself and social situations, which seem to contribute to your withdrawal from social interactions. Physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym> are also present but appear to be occasional and not linked to any specific medical issue. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and negative ruminations that are impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym> related to social situations, including avoidance behaviors, worry about embarrassment, and panic-like episodes, indicates <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances characterized by <sym>insomnia and frequent awakenings</sym> are common in depression and anxiety states. The negative intrusive thoughts about social self-evaluation further support social anxiety features. The absence of suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or compulsive behaviors suggests these are not primary features of other disorders such as psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The physical symptoms are likely somatic manifestations of mood and anxiety symptoms rather than medical conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.  \n2. Consider initiating <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depressive and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, which are effective for depression and social anxiety.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or behavioral interventions.  \n5. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or increased anxiety, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n6. Consider consultation with a psychiatrist for medication management if indicated.",
