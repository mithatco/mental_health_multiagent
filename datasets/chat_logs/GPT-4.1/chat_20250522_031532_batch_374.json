You've also mentioned ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including worries, panic, avoidance, and physical discomfort, which seem to fluctuate with your mood states. Additionally, your concerns about <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, substance use, and feelings of disconnection highlight the importance of a careful, supportive approach to your care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode manic, moderate severity, with mixed features, and comorbid generalized anxiety disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>recurrent depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, decreased <sym>sleep</sym>, increased goal-directed activity, and impulsivity, are consistent with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>.

The history of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive states warrants ongoing risk assessment. The substance use (alcohol and cigarettes, as well as unprescribed medication use) complicates the clinical picture and suggests potential maladaptive coping strategies, which are common in mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment, including evaluation of mood episodes, substance use, and risk of self-harm.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including medications such as lithium or other mood stabilizers, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address anxiety, mood regulation, and substance use.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance misuse, with appropriate crisis planning.  \n6.

Concurrently, reports of elevated mood states, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, increased goal-directed activity, and engagement in risky behaviors suggest episodes of hypomania or mania. Anxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical complaints such as unexplained aches. Cognitive difficulties, notably impaired concentration and memory, are also noted, particularly during mood episodes.\n\nThere is a pattern of mood fluctuation with notable bipolar features, evidenced by the alternation between depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms. The patient's substance use (alcohol and cigarettes), along with self-reported use of unprescribed medications, raises concern for potential substance misuse or maladaptive coping strategies.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Thoughts of self-harm during depressive episodes, although no current intent or plans are reported.\n- Engagement in impulsive and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes.\n- Physical symptoms related to stress and anxiety.\n- Use of substances without medical supervision, which could complicate mood regulation and overall functioning.\n- Social withdrawal and reduced emotional connectedness.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture suggests a mood disorder with bipolar features, comorbid anxiety, and substance use concerns. Ongoing assessment of suicide risk, substance misuse, and functional impairment is warranted, alongside consideration for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to inform targeted treatment planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health experiences, and I want to acknowledge the challenges you're facing. It sounds like you've been dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, especially during depressive episodes. At the same time, you've described periods of elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engagement in risky behaviors\u2014symptoms that suggest episodes of <med>bipolar disorder</med>. You've also mentioned ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, including worries, panic, avoidance, and physical discomfort, which seem to fluctuate with your mood states. Additionally, your concerns about <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, substance use, and feelings of disconnection highlight the importance of a careful, supportive approach to your care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode manic, moderate severity, with mixed features, and comorbid generalized anxiety disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>recurrent depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, decreased <sym>sleep</sym>, increased goal-directed activity, and impulsivity, are consistent with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>mixed features</sym>\u2014simultaneous symptoms of depression and mania\u2014further supports this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance, indicate a comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The history of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive states warrants ongoing risk assessment. The substance use (alcohol and cigarettes, as well as unprescribed medication use) complicates the clinical picture and suggests potential maladaptive coping strategies, which are common in mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment, including evaluation of mood episodes, substance use, and risk of self-harm.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including medications such as lithium or other mood stabilizers, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address anxiety, mood regulation, and substance use.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance misuse, with appropriate crisis planning.  \n6. Collaborate with addiction specialists if substance use persists or worsens.",
