This is a brief questionnaire designed to get a sense of your current mental health across various areas. The purpose is to better understand how you're feeling and functioning so we can discuss any concerns you might have. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health, and I will ask each one in turn. You can take your time with your answers, and if you're unsure or uncomfortable at any point, just let me know. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional and physical challenges that are affecting your daily life. You mentioned feelings of <sym>persistent sadness, numbness, and hopelessness</sym> that have been ongoing, along with <sym>irritability and heightened anxiety</sym> that make it difficult to relax. Sleep disturbances, such as waking early and feeling exhausted despite less sleep, are also impacting your energy and mood. You\u2019ve noticed <sym>difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and feelings of dissociation or detachment</sym>, which can feel confusing and isolating. Additionally, you\u2019ve experienced <sym>somatic complaints like headaches and body aches that seem unexplained</sym>, as well as <sym>intrusive negative thoughts and some thoughts of self-harm</sym>. You also described withdrawing from social interactions and feeling lost about your identity and purpose. It sounds like these symptoms are deeply distressing and impacting multiple areas of your life, and I want to acknowledge how difficult that must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a >2-week history of pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, reports of <sym>excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and heightened anxiety</sym> point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization</sym> suggest dissociative features that often accompany mood or trauma-related disorders. The self-harm thoughts warrant close monitoring and safety planning. The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance misuse indicates these are not primary concerns at this time. The overall symptom pattern aligns with a moderate severity of depression, with notable anxiety and dissociative features contributing to the clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to assess the severity of symptoms, risk of self-harm, and any history of trauma or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ensure immediate safety if risk escalates.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and functional impairment.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if needed, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n6. Explore options for supportive interventions, such as peer support groups or psychoeducation, to help with social withdrawal and identity concerns.  \n7. Monitor symptoms regularly for changes in mood, safety, and overall functioning, adjusting treatment plans accordingly.",

There is evidence of irritability and agitation, alongside significant sleep disturbances marked by early morning awakenings and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns are notable, with reports of impaired concentration, memory difficulties, and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization. The patient exhibits heightened anxiety levels, including general worry, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and body aches, suggesting somatic preoccupations. There are also indications of intrusive negative ruminations and thoughts of self-harm, although no active suicidal plans are disclosed. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships further underscore social and emotional disconnection.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a constellation of depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptoms with overlapping affective and somatic manifestations. The absence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) or substance misuse suggests these are not prominent at this time.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms with comorbid anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and self-harm ideation. The sleep disturbance and cognitive deficits warrant close monitoring. Risk factors for self-harm are present and should be assessed further, especially considering the reported thoughts of harming oneself. The patient's social withdrawal and anhedonia may impact functioning and warrant targeted interventions.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex presentation involving mood disturbance, anxiety, somatic complaints, dissociative experiences, and risk of self-harm, necessitating comprehensive clinical assessment and individualized treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional and physical challenges that are affecting your daily life. You mentioned feelings of <sym>persistent sadness, numbness, and hopelessness</sym> that have been ongoing, along with <sym>irritability and heightened anxiety</sym> that make it difficult to relax. Sleep disturbances, such as waking early and feeling exhausted despite less sleep, are also impacting your energy and mood. You\u2019ve noticed <sym>difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and feelings of dissociation or detachment</sym>, which can feel confusing and isolating. Additionally, you\u2019ve experienced <sym>somatic complaints like headaches and body aches that seem unexplained</sym>, as well as <sym>intrusive negative thoughts and some thoughts of self-harm</sym>. You also described withdrawing from social interactions and feeling lost about your identity and purpose. It sounds like these symptoms are deeply distressing and impacting multiple areas of your life, and I want to acknowledge how difficult that must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a >2-week history of pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, reports of <sym>excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and heightened anxiety</sym> point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization</sym> suggest dissociative features that often accompany mood or trauma-related disorders. The self-harm thoughts warrant close monitoring and safety planning. The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance misuse indicates these are not primary concerns at this time. The overall symptom pattern aligns with a moderate severity of depression, with notable anxiety and dissociative features contributing to the clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to assess the severity of symptoms, risk of self-harm, and any history of trauma or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ensure immediate safety if risk escalates.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and functional impairment.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if needed, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n6. Explore options for supportive interventions, such as peer support groups or psychoeducation, to help with social withdrawal and identity concerns.  \n7. Monitor symptoms regularly for changes in mood, safety, and overall functioning, adjusting treatment plans accordingly.",
