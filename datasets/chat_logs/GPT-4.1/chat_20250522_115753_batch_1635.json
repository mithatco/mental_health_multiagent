We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health by asking about your experiences over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various psychological domains. I'll ask each question one at a time and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

These symptoms collectively suggest a mood disorder with significant anxiety components, and dissociative symptoms may be secondary or related features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed safety evaluation and assessment of functional impairment.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as an SSRI or SNRI, under supervision.  \n3. Recommend individual psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and establish safety planning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if needed, pharmacologic options in consultation with a healthcare provider.  \n6.

There is evidence of psychomotor slowing or fatigue, as evidenced by increased sleep duration coupled with subjective restlessness and exhaustion. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, contributing to daytime fatigue.\n\nAffective symptoms are accompanied by heightened irritability and anger, alongside social withdrawal, suggesting possible social detachment or anhedonia. Anxiety features are evident through reports of persistent worry about the future, occasional panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, which may reflect comorbid anxiety pathology.\n\nCognitive concerns are noted with reports of memory difficulties, which could be related to depressive or anxiety symptoms. Intrusive thoughts related to stress are present, though there are no indications of compulsive behaviors or psychotic phenomena, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions.\n\nRisk assessment reveals some passive suicidal ideation without intent or planning, warranting ongoing monitoring. No current substance misuse or disordered substance use behaviors are endorsed, and there are no indications of psychosis or substance-induced symptoms.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep disturbances.\n- Anxiety symptoms including worry, panic, and avoidance.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.\n- Cognitive complaints related to memory.\n- No active psychotic symptoms or substance abuse reported.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, requiring vigilant assessment and safety planning.\n- Significant social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection, which may exacerbate mood disturbances.\n- Persistent sleep issues and fatigue that could impair functioning.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts, potentially contributing to or stemming from depressive or anxious states.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits clinical features consistent with a major depressive episode, compounded by generalized anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences. The presence of passive suicidal ideation necessitates careful risk management. Further comprehensive assessment, including evaluation of functional impairment and detailed safety assessment, is recommended to inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of ongoing emotional and physical challenges. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, persistent sadness, and social withdrawal. You mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including trouble falling asleep and feeling tired despite sleeping more hours. You also reported <sym>anxiety</sym>, with worries about the future, occasional <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and avoidance of certain situations that increase your distress. Additionally, you experience feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. While you have some passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, you emphasized that you haven't had plans or intent. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant mood and anxiety disturbance that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features, and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as pervasive <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sadness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and social withdrawal. The reported <sym>worry</sym> about the future, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from oneself and surroundings align with dissociative experiences, which often co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants safety monitoring, but there is no evidence of <sym>psychosis</sym>. These symptoms collectively suggest a mood disorder with significant anxiety components, and dissociative symptoms may be secondary or related features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed safety evaluation and assessment of functional impairment.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as an SSRI or SNRI, under supervision.  \n3. Recommend individual psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and establish safety planning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if needed, pharmacologic options in consultation with a healthcare provider.  \n6. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and further assessment if symptoms persist or worsen.",
