Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

The process involves me asking you 23 questions about your experiences over the past two weeks, and I'd like you to answer each one as openly as you feel comfortable. We'll start now\u2014are you ready?"

They disclose <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> that are recurrent and intense, particularly when overwhelmed, and report increased <sym>substance use</sym> as a maladaptive coping strategy. Overall, these symptoms indicate a significant level of distress affecting multiple domains of functioning, requiring careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<provisional>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with mixed features, and comorbid Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and possible psychotic features</provisional>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's symptoms align with <med>major depressive disorder</med> given the persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks. The presence of <sym>irritability, sleep disturbances, and concentration issues</sym> further support this diagnosis.

Additionally, the history of <sym>trauma-related symptoms</sym> like flashbacks and hypervigilance points toward <med>PTSD</med>. The active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the severity and need for urgent intervention. While some symptoms could suggest other diagnoses, the overall pattern most closely fits a recurrent severe depressive episode with comorbid trauma-related symptoms and psychotic features, though further assessment is needed for definitive classification.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess risk, and determine appropriate treatment levels.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Initiate or optimize <med>antidepressant medication</med> and consider adding <med>antipsychotic</med> or <med>mood stabilizer</med> medications if psychotic features persist.  \n4. Refer to psychotherapy specializing in trauma (e.g., trauma-focused CBT or EMDR) and depression.  \n5. Monitor substance use closely and provide integrated treatment for <sym>substance misuse</sym>.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, pharmacologic support.  \n7. Engage the patient in supportive services and establish a strong therapeutic alliance to facilitate ongoing care and recovery.",

There is evidence of marked irritability and emotional dysregulation, characterized by increased irritability, anger outbursts, and a sense of being on edge. Sleep disturbance is prominent, with reports of insomnia, nightmares, and non-restorative sleep, correlating with heightened fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as impaired memory and concentration. Anxiety symptoms are substantial, evidenced by constant worry, hypervigilance, physiological arousal (heart racing, shakiness), avoidance behaviors (notably avoiding driving and crowded environments), and episodes of panic. \n\nPsychotic-like experiences are reported, including auditory hallucinations (hearing voices or whispers) and delusional beliefs of thought broadcasting or mind reading, which occur especially during heightened stress or nightmares. These experiences warrant further assessment for possible psychosis spectrum features. The patient also reports dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization and derealization, alongside feelings of emotional numbness and disconnection from self and others, indicating possible dissociative features or trauma-related symptoms.\n\nThere are notable self-injurious thoughts, with recurring suicidal ideation, particularly when overwhelmed, which constitutes a significant risk factor. Substance use appears to be maladaptive, with increased alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking used as coping mechanisms, and recent misuse of prescribed medications (painkillers and sedatives) without medical guidance, heightening concerns around self-harm and overdose risk.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, comorbid anxiety disorder, dissociative symptoms, subthreshold psychotic features, and substance use disorder. The confluence of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and psychotic-like symptoms, combined with active suicidal ideation and substance misuse, indicates a complex presentation requiring comprehensive evaluation and integrated intervention strategies to address both symptomatic distress and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex and intense presentation of emotional distress, including pervasive <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless and losing joy in activities</quote>, along with significant <sym>irritability and anger</sym>. They report ongoing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by nightmares, waking frequently, and feeling restless despite little sleep. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with <quote>constant worry, physical symptoms like racing heart and shakiness</quote>, and avoidance behaviors like <quote>not driving and staying home</quote>. Psychotic-like experiences, including <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional beliefs about thoughts being read or broadcast</sym>, are also present, especially during stressful or nightmare episodes. The patient expresses <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, such as feeling detached from themselves and their surroundings, along with <sym>intrusive flashbacks</sym>. They disclose <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> that are recurrent and intense, particularly when overwhelmed, and report increased <sym>substance use</sym> as a maladaptive coping strategy. Overall, these symptoms indicate a significant level of distress affecting multiple domains of functioning, requiring careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<provisional>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with mixed features, and comorbid Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and possible psychotic features</provisional>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's symptoms align with <med>major depressive disorder</med> given the persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks. The presence of <sym>irritability, sleep disturbances, and concentration issues</sym> further support this diagnosis. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>delusional beliefs</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest <med>psychotic features</med> occurring within a mood disorder context. Additionally, the history of <sym>trauma-related symptoms</sym> like flashbacks and hypervigilance points toward <med>PTSD</med>. The active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the severity and need for urgent intervention. While some symptoms could suggest other diagnoses, the overall pattern most closely fits a recurrent severe depressive episode with comorbid trauma-related symptoms and psychotic features, though further assessment is needed for definitive classification.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess risk, and determine appropriate treatment levels.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Initiate or optimize <med>antidepressant medication</med> and consider adding <med>antipsychotic</med> or <med>mood stabilizer</med> medications if psychotic features persist.  \n4. Refer to psychotherapy specializing in trauma (e.g., trauma-focused CBT or EMDR) and depression.  \n5. Monitor substance use closely and provide integrated treatment for <sym>substance misuse</sym>.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, pharmacologic support.  \n7. Engage the patient in supportive services and establish a strong therapeutic alliance to facilitate ongoing care and recovery.",
