There are notable irritability and agitation, as well as somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal discomfort, indicative of psychosomatic manifestations of distress. The patient reports episodic panic attacks with racing heart and feelings of losing control, compounded by avoidance of social and situational triggers, suggestive of social anxiety or panic-related avoidance.\n\nSleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep with associated non-restorative rest, are evident. Repetitive intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors further point to obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, are reported, which could indicate dissociative symptoms or heightened dissociative states linked to emotional dysregulation. The patient's sense of identity confusion and social withdrawal suggest possible issues with self-concept and interpersonal functioning.\n\nImportantly, the patient endorses suicidal ideation, indicating a significant risk factor for self-harm. No psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or substance dependence are reported, and no evidence of psychotic phenomena or substance-related exacerbation is noted.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry, panic attacks, and avoidance.\n- Somatic complaints correlated with emotional distress.\n- Repetitive compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts consistent with obsessive-compulsive features.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity concerns suggest complex emotional processing.\n- Suicidal ideation warrants urgent clinical attention.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Persistent depressive symptoms and hopelessness.\n- Active suicidal thoughts.\n- Episodic panic attacks and avoidance behaviors increasing risk for functional impairment.\n- Dissociative experiences indicating emotional regulation difficulties.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety with panic features, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, dissociative experiences, and suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the need for immediate safety assessment, comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, and development of an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidality.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently. You feel <sym>persistent low mood and a loss of interest in activities that once brought you joy</sym>. You often feel <sym>overwhelmed by worry and anxiety, with frequent panic attacks that include racing heart and feelings of losing control</sym>. You also notice <sym>irritability, difficulty sleeping, and physical aches such as headaches and muscle tension</sym>. You describe <sym>repetitive thoughts that trouble you and compulsive checking behaviors</sym>, and sometimes feel <sym>detached from yourself or the world around you</sym>. Additionally, you've had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and feel <sym>a sense of confusion about your identity and a sense of disconnection from others</sym>. These symptoms seem to significantly impact your daily functioning and emotional well-being, and your safety concerns are especially important to address.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Features, and presence of dissociative experiences with suicidal ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include <sym>persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic attacks, avoidance, and hyperarousal point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The repetitive intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>. The reports of feeling detached from oneself and surroundings align with <med>dissociative experiences</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates the need for urgent safety assessment. The combination of mood, anxiety, compulsive behaviors, and dissociative symptoms suggests a complex presentation requiring careful, integrated management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and risk factors.  \n2. Initiate a collaborative treatment plan that may include <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Trauma-Informed Therapy) to address depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3.
