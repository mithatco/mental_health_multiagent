The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores the importance of addressing your safety and overall mental health urgently. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, psychotic, dissociative, and substance use issues that require careful assessment and treatment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features (likely Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features) combined with anxiety symptoms and substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down, hopeless, and numb</quote>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym>, fulfill criteria for a <med>major depressive episode</med>.

Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and evaluate the need for inpatient or outpatient treatment.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing active or passive suicidal ideation, including close monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider starting or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with antipsychotic properties, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Provide or refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and trauma-informed approaches, to address mood, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies.  \n6. Coordinate care with substance use treatment specialists if needed.  \n7. Regularly monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and safety over time, adjusting treatment as necessary.",

Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by insomnia and difficulty achieving restful sleep (Q5, Q15). There are notable cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including memory impairment (Q16), dissociative experiences such as depersonalization and derealization (Q19), and auditory hallucinations (Q13). The patient reports intrusive, distressing thoughts and compulsive behaviors (Q17, Q18), suggestive of underlying obsessive-compulsive features. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, including generalized feelings of nervousness and hypervigilance (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations (Q9). The patient also reports somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and muscle tension (Q10). There are indications of paranoid ideation (Q14), with beliefs about thought broadcasting and mind-reading, which may signal psychotic features.\n\nSubstance use behaviors are significant, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits (Q22), regular cigarette smoking (Q23), and recent use of unprescribed medications and marijuana (Q24). The patient admits to passive suicidal ideation without current intent but acknowledges active distress related to mood and functioning.\n\nPatterns suggest a complex presentation involving depressive, anxious, psychotic, and substance use symptoms. The patient's self-reported experiences of dissociation, hallucinations, paranoid beliefs, and substance use are clinically significant and warrant comprehensive evaluation. Risk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and substance misuse, which increase clinical concern for potential self-harm and worsening psychiatric stability.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of depressive and anxious symptoms, psychotic features, dissociative experiences, and substance use, necessitating integrated assessment and intervention to address mood, psychosis, and safety considerations.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of distressing symptoms that indicate significant emotional, cognitive, and perceptual challenges. You described persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, loss of <sym>interest or pleasure</sym>, and a sense of numbness, which suggest a deep mood disturbance. Your experiences of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep difficulties</sym> further highlight the severity of your emotional state. You also mentioned <sym>intrusive and disturbing thoughts</sym>, <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, and <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym>, indicating possible <med>psychotic features</med>. Your reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling <sym>detached from yourself or reality</sym> suggest dissociative experiences. Additionally, your substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, appears to be a way of coping with ongoing distress. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores the importance of addressing your safety and overall mental health urgently. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, psychotic, dissociative, and substance use issues that require careful assessment and treatment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features (likely Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features) combined with anxiety symptoms and substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down, hopeless, and numb</quote>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym>, fulfill criteria for a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest <med>psychotic features</med> concurrent with depression. The reported <sym>panic episodes</sym>, <sym>generalized anxiety</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point to significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. Substance use behaviors, including alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, complicate the clinical picture and may contribute to or exacerbate symptoms. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate a need for safety planning. Overall, the combination of mood, psychotic, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features</med>, with comorbid <med>substance use disorder</med> and significant anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and evaluate the need for inpatient or outpatient treatment.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing active or passive suicidal ideation, including close monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider starting or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with antipsychotic properties, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Provide or refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and trauma-informed approaches, to address mood, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies.  \n6. Coordinate care with substance use treatment specialists if needed.  \n7. Regularly monitor symptoms, medication adherence, and safety over time, adjusting treatment as necessary.",
