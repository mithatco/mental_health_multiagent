Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different areas. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences honestly. We will go through a total of 23 questions, one by one, about your current feelings and behaviors over the past two weeks. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand what you've been experiencing. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Anxiety features are prominent, characterized by persistent worry, heightened irritability (Q4), sleep disturbances despite increased sleep duration (Q5, Q15), and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded settings (Q9). There are reports of somatic complaints, notably headaches and stomachaches (Q10), which may be stress-related.\n\nIntrusive and distressing thoughts are evident, including dark ruminations about self-harm (Q12) and intrusive images (Q17). While there are no current psychotic symptoms (Q13, Q14), experiences of derealization or depersonalization are reported intermittently (Q19). The patient reports a sense of identity confusion and social withdrawal (Q20, Q21), aligning with possible dissociative or identity-related concerns.\n\nSubstance use appears minimal, with limited alcohol intake and no tobacco or misuse of medications reported (Q22\u2013Q24). Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation and recent mood deterioration. No current evidence of psychosis or substance dependence is indicated.\n\nPatterns suggest a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, possibly complicated by dissociative experiences. The patient's self-reported symptoms warrant comprehensive assessment for depressive and anxiety disorders, with close monitoring of suicidal thoughts and dissociative phenomena. Further evaluation is recommended to clarify the severity, duration, and functional impact of these symptoms, and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing significant <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You\u2019ve also described persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which have been affecting your daily functioning. Sleep disturbances, including both difficulty falling asleep and waking up during the night, along with increasing <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, seem to be contributing to your distress. You mentioned experiencing some <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> feelings and a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. While you have had some <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, you have not engaged in any <sym>suicidal behavior</sym>. Additionally, you reported <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, which you associate with stress. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, which are significantly impacting your well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and physical complaints further support an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component. Reports of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> suggest dissociative features, which may be secondary or comorbid. While no <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> are present, the combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms indicates a complex mood and anxiety presentation that warrants comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a full psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk factors such as <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and explore potential underlying trauma or stressors.  \n2. Initiate a combined treatment plan that includes <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anxiolytics) and <sym>psychotherapy</sym> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-informed therapy) tailored to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Monitor closely for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and provide crisis resources if needed.  \n4. Encourage regular routines, stress management techniques, and gradual re-engagement in social activities as tolerated.  \n5. Consider referral to a specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.",
