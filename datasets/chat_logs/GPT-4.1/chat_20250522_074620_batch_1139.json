You described persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, engaging in risky behaviors and starting many new projects impulsively. Anxiety has been a prominent concern, with constant <sym>worry</sym>, physical sensations like <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that feel intense and sudden. Sleep issues, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, have been ongoing, and you've noticed recent <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014such as feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you shared that you've had <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> and have been using substances like alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs to cope with these feelings. You also expressed feeling misunderstood or not believed when discussing your health concerns. Your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, impulsivity, and substance use, which are all contributing to your current distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Features of Dissociation and Impulsivity</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The widespread anxiety symptoms\u2014including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors\u2014suggest a significant comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences such as <sym>feeling detached from self and surroundings</sym> and recent <sym>identity confusion</sym> point toward features of dissociation, which can be associated with trauma or severe stress reactions. Impulsivity, risky behaviors, and substance misuse indicate potential <med>impulsivity and behavioral dysregulation</med>. The self-reported <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use increase the clinical urgency, highlighting the need for immediate safety assessment and intervention. Overall, the constellation of affective, anxiety, dissociative, and behavioral symptoms suggests a complex mood and anxiety presentation with additional features that warrant a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct an immediate safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm risk</sym>, with potential hospitalization if necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, including screening for trauma history and dissociative disorders.  \n3. Develop a safety plan addressing substance use and impulsivity, and consider involving a substance use specialist if appropriate.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, tailored to the patient's symptoms and safety considerations.  \n5. Refer for psychotherapy, particularly approaches targeting depression, anxiety, trauma, and impulsivity, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused therapies.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies.  \n7. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia, pervasive feelings of depression and hopelessness, and increased irritability\u2014suggestive of depressive symptomatology. The patient reports heightened anxiety, characterized by constant worry, physical symptoms (restlessness, tension, headaches), and episodes of panic with associated avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings. Sleep disturbances are evident, with irregular sleep patterns and frequent nighttime awakenings, contributing to daytime fatigue.\n\nCognitive concerns are noted, including forgetfulness and recent issues with memory, alongside dissociative experiences such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, and a diminished sense of identity and connection to others. There are also reports of impulsive behaviors, including initiation of multiple projects, risky activities, and misuse of substances\u2014alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs\u2014indicating possible impulsivity and maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation, with thoughts of self-harm during periods of distress, raising immediate safety considerations. The presence of substance misuse, combined with previous self-harm thoughts, heightens risk factors for both self-injury and potential worsening of mental health status.\n\nPatterns suggest a mood disorder with prominent depressive and anxiety features, possibly compounded by dissociative symptoms and impulsivity. The patient's substance use appears to be used as a maladaptive coping strategy.\n\nClinical concerns include the severity of depressive symptoms, active suicidal ideation, substance misuse, dissociative experiences, and impulsivity, all of which warrant comprehensive evaluation and immediate safety assessment. Further diagnostic clarification is necessary to determine appropriate treatment interventions, including risk management and targeted psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic strategies.",

Although the primary focus appears to be on mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, the inclusion of substance use as a significant component aligns with substance abuse issues.

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult emotions and symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You described persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, engaging in risky behaviors and starting many new projects impulsively. Anxiety has been a prominent concern, with constant <sym>worry</sym>, physical sensations like <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that feel intense and sudden. Sleep issues, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, have been ongoing, and you've noticed recent <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014such as feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you shared that you've had <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> and have been using substances like alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs to cope with these feelings. You also expressed feeling misunderstood or not believed when discussing your health concerns. Your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, impulsivity, and substance use, which are all contributing to your current distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Features of Dissociation and Impulsivity</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The widespread anxiety symptoms\u2014including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors\u2014suggest a significant comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences such as <sym>feeling detached from self and surroundings</sym> and recent <sym>identity confusion</sym> point toward features of dissociation, which can be associated with trauma or severe stress reactions. Impulsivity, risky behaviors, and substance misuse indicate potential <med>impulsivity and behavioral dysregulation</med>. The self-reported <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use increase the clinical urgency, highlighting the need for immediate safety assessment and intervention. Overall, the constellation of affective, anxiety, dissociative, and behavioral symptoms suggests a complex mood and anxiety presentation with additional features that warrant a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct an immediate safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm risk</sym>, with potential hospitalization if necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, including screening for trauma history and dissociative disorders.  \n3. Develop a safety plan addressing substance use and impulsivity, and consider involving a substance use specialist if appropriate.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, tailored to the patient's symptoms and safety considerations.  \n5. Refer for psychotherapy, particularly approaches targeting depression, anxiety, trauma, and impulsivity, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused therapies.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies.  \n7. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",
