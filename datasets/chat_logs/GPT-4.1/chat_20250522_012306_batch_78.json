Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various psychological symptoms you may be experiencing across different domains. The purpose of this assessment is to get a broad understanding of how you've been feeling over the past two weeks, which can help guide any further support or treatment you might need. Please remember that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. We will go through 23 questions, one by one. Are you ready to begin?"

You've also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and having trouble with <sym>sleep</sym>, including waking up frequently and feeling tired during the day. Cognitive concerns like increased forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating are present, and you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially in social situations, with some <sym>panic-like feelings</sym> before social events. Additionally, you occasionally feel <sym>detached from yourself</sym> or your surroundings, which can be unsettling. Despite these challenges, you do not report thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or current <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and disconnected at times, which can be very distressing, but you're reaching out and sharing honestly, which is a positive step towards support and healing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, and cognitive issues like forgetfulness further support this diagnosis. The anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, point toward comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>detachment</sym> from self and surroundings, along with feelings of identity confusion, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which may occur in mood and anxiety disorders, especially under stress. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> at this time is noted, but the severity of symptoms warrants close monitoring. Overall, the presentation indicates a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum with dissociative features, requiring comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxious symptoms, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Discuss potential pharmacotherapy options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), to help alleviate mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects.  \n4. Explore strategies to improve sleep hygiene and manage sleep disturbances, possibly including behavioral techniques or medical consultation.  \n5. Ensure ongoing support and regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, risk factors, and treatment response, adjusting the plan as needed.",

Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia characterized by a lack of interest or pleasure in activities, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and reports of increased irritability. Sleep disturbances are evident, with decreased sleep duration coupled with subjective fatigue, although the patient reports sustained energy levels, which may warrant further assessment. Cognitive concerns are noted, including increased forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. The patient also reports heightened anxiety, particularly in social contexts, with avoidance behaviors and experiences of panic-like sensations prior to social engagements. Dissociative phenomena, such as feelings of detachment from self and surroundings, are described intermittently, alongside existential concerns about personal identity and purpose. Social withdrawal and emotional numbing are evident, with decreased sense of connection to others and diminished enjoyment in relationships.\n\nPatterns of concern include co-occurring depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal), anxiety symptoms (social anxiety, panic-like episodes), and dissociative experiences. Substance use appears minimal, with no current evidence of substance misuse or self-harm ideation.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder features, generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, social anxiety disorder, and dissociative experiences. The patient's sleep disturbances and cognitive complaints may also suggest concomitant neurocognitive or stress-related issues.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive death wishes (\"wish I could just disappear\") without active suicidal ideation, which warrants ongoing monitoring. The absence of current suicidal thoughts is noted, but the severity of hopelessness and social withdrawal suggests a need for continued assessment of suicide risk.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits significant emotional dysregulation, cognitive disruptions, and dissociative symptoms consistent with a mood and anxiety disorder spectrum. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and potential intervention plan tailored to these symptoms are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of experiences that suggest you're going through a difficult time. You've described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities that once brought you pleasure. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and having trouble with <sym>sleep</sym>, including waking up frequently and feeling tired during the day. Cognitive concerns like increased forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating are present, and you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially in social situations, with some <sym>panic-like feelings</sym> before social events. Additionally, you occasionally feel <sym>detached from yourself</sym> or your surroundings, which can be unsettling. Despite these challenges, you do not report thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or current <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and disconnected at times, which can be very distressing, but you're reaching out and sharing honestly, which is a positive step towards support and healing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, and cognitive issues like forgetfulness further support this diagnosis. The anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, point toward comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>detachment</sym> from self and surroundings, along with feelings of identity confusion, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which may occur in mood and anxiety disorders, especially under stress. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> at this time is noted, but the severity of symptoms warrants close monitoring. Overall, the presentation indicates a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum with dissociative features, requiring comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxious symptoms, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Discuss potential pharmacotherapy options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), to help alleviate mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects.  \n4. Explore strategies to improve sleep hygiene and manage sleep disturbances, possibly including behavioral techniques or medical consultation.  \n5. Ensure ongoing support and regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, risk factors, and treatment response, adjusting the plan as needed.",
