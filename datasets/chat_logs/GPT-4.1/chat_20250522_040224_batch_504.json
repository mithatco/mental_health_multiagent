Your experience of <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014worrying about the future and avoiding social situations\u2014further complicates your emotional state. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> without intent are particularly concerning and highlight the importance of ongoing safety assessment.

The presence of ongoing worry, avoidance behaviors, and physiological symptoms such as headaches and joint pains support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component, likely with anxious distress.

Passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without active plans indicate a need for safety monitoring but do not currently meet criteria for <med>Suicidal Ideation</med> with intent. Overall, the constellation of symptoms indicates a moderate severity of mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and evaluate for any underlying trauma or medical conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, focusing on mood, cognition, and anxiety management.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med>, to address depressive and anxious symptoms, with close monitoring.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> or dissociative symptoms, and develop a safety plan.  \n6. Explore additional supportive interventions, such as social engagement and psychoeducation, tailored to your needs.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports a constellation of affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms consistent with depressive and anxious features. Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia and anhedonic affect, characterized by diminished interest and pleasure in activities (Q2), persistent feelings of hopelessness and sadness (Q3), and social withdrawal (Q21). Sleep disturbances are prominent, with early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), contributing to fatigue (Q10). The patient also experiences cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation (Q16), along with somatic complaints like unexplained aches and pains (Q10).\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident, including heightened worry, difficulty relaxing, and avoidance behaviors (Q7, Q9). The presence of occasional fearful sensations without panic attacks suggests moderate anxiety levels. Intrusive negative thoughts are recurrent (Q17), and feelings of dissociation or detachment from self and surroundings are reported (Q19), indicating dissociative experiences. The patient endorses passive ideation related to self-harm, with thoughts of death but no intent or plans (Q12), which warrants careful monitoring.\n\nLack of engagement in risky or impulsive behaviors (Q6) suggests the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes at this time. Substance use appears minimal, with no significant alcohol abuse or tobacco use reported (Q22, Q23). No hallucinations or psychotic features are reported (Q13, Q14), and there is no evidence of compulsive behaviors (Q18).\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Comorbid anxiety symptoms with avoidance and worry.\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue significantly impacting daily functioning.\n- Cognitive and somatic complaints consistent with depressive and anxious presentations.\n- Passive suicidal ideation without active plans, requiring vigilant assessment.\n- Dissociative experiences suggest possible dissociative symptoms or depersonalization.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Persistent hopelessness and passive death thoughts signal potential increased suicide risk, necessitating ongoing safety evaluation.\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue may exacerbate mood and cognitive symptoms.\n- Dissociative experiences and social withdrawal could reflect underlying trauma or severity of affective dysregulation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptomatology with prominent anhedonia, hopelessness, cognitive impairments, and sleep disturbances, compounded by moderate anxiety and dissociative features. Passive suicidal ideation warrants close monitoring. The symptom profile suggests an underlying mood disorder, possibly major depression with anxious features, requiring comprehensive clinical assessment and tailored intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience marked by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where you feel disconnected from activities you once enjoyed. Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>worthlessness</sym>, and difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>\u2014including early awakening and non-restorative sleep\u2014are significantly impacting your daily life. You also mentioned cognitive challenges like <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, along with somatic complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>joint pains</sym>. Your experience of <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014worrying about the future and avoiding social situations\u2014further complicates your emotional state. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> without intent are particularly concerning and highlight the importance of ongoing safety assessment. Overall, your symptoms point towards a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, which requires compassionate attention and careful evaluation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, hopelessness, and sleep disturbances aligns with diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing worry, avoidance behaviors, and physiological symptoms such as headaches and joint pains support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component, likely with anxious distress. The dissociative experiences, including feelings of disconnection from self and surroundings, suggest additional <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> that can accompany severe depression or anxiety. Passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without active plans indicate a need for safety monitoring but do not currently meet criteria for <med>Suicidal Ideation</med> with intent. Overall, the constellation of symptoms indicates a moderate severity of mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and evaluate for any underlying trauma or medical conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, focusing on mood, cognition, and anxiety management.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med>, to address depressive and anxious symptoms, with close monitoring.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> or dissociative symptoms, and develop a safety plan.  \n6. Explore additional supportive interventions, such as social engagement and psychoeducation, tailored to your needs.",
