It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms have impacted your daily life and emotional well-being, and your honesty is a vital part of understanding what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical conditions that may contribute to symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), tailored to the patient's symptom profile and preferences.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on managing anxiety, addressing depressive thoughts, and developing coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts and ensure safety planning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral interventions and, if needed, medication management.  \n6. Encourage social engagement and gradual exposure to avoided situations to reduce avoidance behaviors.",

Concurrently, there is evidence of significant anxiety symptomatology characterized by pervasive worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints such as muscle tension and headaches. Sleep disturbances, notably insomnia with difficulty maintaining sleep, are reported. The patient also endorses feelings of emotional numbness or dissociation, as well as intrusive negative thoughts and rumination.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxious symptoms, with notable avoidance of social situations and triggers for panic episodes. While there is no current evidence of psychotic phenomena or compulsive behaviors, the patient reports occasional suicidal ideation, specifically passive dark thoughts as a means of escape, which warrants vigilant monitoring.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include depressive mood, anhedonia, irritability, anxiety with panic features, sleep disturbance, social withdrawal, and passive suicidal ideation. The patient's self-report of feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers and experiencing somatic symptoms suggests heightened distress and possible somatic amplification.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, social withdrawal, and recent sleep disruption. While substance use appears minimal, vigilance is advised regarding ongoing mental health risks.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture reflects a complex presentation of mood and anxiety disorders, with associated somatic symptoms and risk for self-harm. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to inform differential diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and challenging experience characterized by persistent <sym>depressive</sym> feelings such as <quote>lack of interest in activities, feeling down and hopeless</quote>, along with significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> including pervasive worry, <quote>panic attacks</quote>, and avoidance of situations that trigger your fears. You also experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, like difficulty sleeping and staying asleep, as well as somatic symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension. Your reports of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> and feelings of emotional disconnection suggest a high level of distress. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms have impacted your daily life and emotional well-being, and your honesty is a vital part of understanding what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and somatic complaints indicates significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> further support this diagnosis. Although there are no indications of psychosis or compulsive rituals, the passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful attention. The combination of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests a comorbid presentation rather than a single disorder, but the primary diagnosis centers on the moderate level of depression with prominent anxiety features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical conditions that may contribute to symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), tailored to the patient's symptom profile and preferences.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on managing anxiety, addressing depressive thoughts, and developing coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts and ensure safety planning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral interventions and, if needed, medication management.  \n6. Encourage social engagement and gradual exposure to avoided situations to reduce avoidance behaviors.",
