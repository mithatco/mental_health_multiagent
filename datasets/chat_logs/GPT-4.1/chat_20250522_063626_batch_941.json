We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to help us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to identify any areas that might need further exploration or support, and I want to assure you that everything you share here is confidential and will be kept private. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and naturally, describing your experiences in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019re experiencing difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling restless despite very little sleep, and noticing problems with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling lost or disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've described engaging in impulsive and risky behaviors, including substance use and self-medicating with medications obtained informally. Your social withdrawal and feelings of detachment suggest a profound sense of disconnection from others and yourself, which can be very isolating. Your experiences reflect a mixture of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues, all of which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings and experiences, and I am here to support you in exploring these challenges further.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, Recurrent, Moderate; <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>; <med>Panic Disorder</med>; <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (specifically alcohol and nicotine); <med>unspecified dissociative symptoms</med> (including depersonalization or derealization) and possible <med>cognitive impairment</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep contribute to the overall impairment. Cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation, along with dissociative experiences like <sym>depersonalization</sym>, point to significant distress that may involve dissociative symptoms. The patient's engagement in impulsive behaviors, risky activities, and ongoing substance use indicate <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, likely exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive, integrated clinical approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including neurocognitive assessment and medical workup, to clarify the extent of cognitive impairment and rule out underlying medical causes.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), targeting depression, anxiety, dissociation, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use behaviors.  \n4. Address substance use concerns by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and referral to specialized addiction treatment if appropriate.  \n5. Develop a safety plan to manage acute symptoms of panic, dissociation, or suicidal ideation, and ensure ongoing support and monitoring.",

They also endorse significant anxiety features, including persistent worry, hyperarousal, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors indicative of social and situational anxiety. Sleep disturbance is prominent, with decreased sleep duration, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep contributing to fatigue. Cognitive concerns are noted, including memory impairment and disorientation in familiar environments, which may warrant further neurocognitive assessment.\n\nAdditionally, the patient describes episodes of dissociation, including depersonalization, and experiences intrusive, negative ruminative thoughts. There are signs of impulsivity and increased risk-taking behaviors, including impulsive spending and substance use. Substance use is notable, with current alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, regular cigarette smoking, and self-medication with prescription medications obtained informally, indicating potential substance use disorder and self-medication behaviors.\n\nThe patient also reports somatic symptoms such as persistent headaches and muscle aches, possibly stress-related, and a sense of disconnection from self and others, with social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, dissociative symptoms, substance use disorder, and possible neurocognitive impairment. Risk factors include substance misuse, impulsivity, and self-medication, which pose safety concerns. The patient's presentation suggests a complex clinical picture involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use domains, requiring comprehensive evaluation and integrated intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health, including persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>. You\u2019re experiencing difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling restless despite very little sleep, and noticing problems with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling lost or disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've described engaging in impulsive and risky behaviors, including substance use and self-medicating with medications obtained informally. Your social withdrawal and feelings of detachment suggest a profound sense of disconnection from others and yourself, which can be very isolating. Your experiences reflect a mixture of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues, all of which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings and experiences, and I am here to support you in exploring these challenges further.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, Recurrent, Moderate; <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>; <med>Panic Disorder</med>; <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (specifically alcohol and nicotine); <med>unspecified dissociative symptoms</med> (including depersonalization or derealization) and possible <med>cognitive impairment</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep contribute to the overall impairment. Cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation, along with dissociative experiences like <sym>depersonalization</sym>, point to significant distress that may involve dissociative symptoms. The patient's engagement in impulsive behaviors, risky activities, and ongoing substance use indicate <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, likely exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive, integrated clinical approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including neurocognitive assessment and medical workup, to clarify the extent of cognitive impairment and rule out underlying medical causes.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), targeting depression, anxiety, dissociation, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use behaviors.  \n4. Address substance use concerns by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and referral to specialized addiction treatment if appropriate.  \n5. Develop a safety plan to manage acute symptoms of panic, dissociation, or suicidal ideation, and ensure ongoing support and monitoring.",
