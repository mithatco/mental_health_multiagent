This questionnaire helps us understand various areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. My goal is to create a safe, confidential space where you can honestly share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, covering different aspects like mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a lot about your current experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a very difficult time. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling down, hopeless, and lacking interest in activities you once enjoyed</quote>. Additionally, you report significant <sym>anxiety</sym> with constant worries, physical sensations like a racing heart, and avoidance of situations that trigger these feelings. You also described <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and intrusive negative thoughts, which add to your distress. You mentioned feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, questioning your identity, and feeling <sym>isolated from others</sym>. You\u2019ve had some fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is important to take seriously, and you experience some physical discomfort and tension as well. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, all contributing to your sense of distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, lasting over a two-week period. The high level of <sym> worry</sym>, <sym>hyperarousal</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate significant <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as <sym>depersonalization</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and identity questioning suggests dissociative features that may be associated with trauma-related processes. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>check behaviors</sym>, and sleep disturbances further support an overlapping mood and anxiety presentation. The transient <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> require careful attention but do not currently indicate active intent or planning. The combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms points toward a complex, comorbid presentation rather than a single diagnosis, but Major Depressive Disorder appears to be the primary concern at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify symptom duration, severity, and history, including trauma history.  \n2. Initiate safety planning and provide immediate support regarding suicidal thoughts, with close monitoring.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and anxiety.  \n4. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Explore trauma-focused therapies if trauma or dissociative symptoms are prominent.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation.  \n7. Regularly monitor symptoms and functional status, adjusting treatment as needed.",

Elevated anxiety levels are evident, characterized by chronic worry, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors, alongside somatic complaints such as muscle tension and gastrointestinal discomfort, which may reflect somatic manifestations of anxiety. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty maintaining restful sleep and fatigue, are reported, alongside cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and intrusive negative thoughts, indicating possible cognitive impairment or heightened distress.\n\nNotably, the patient endorses fleeting suicidal ideation without current intent or planning, representing a potential safety concern. Dissociative experiences, including depersonalization and derealization, coupled with identity questioning, suggest dissociative symptomatology. Social withdrawal and diminished emotional connection point to interpersonal and affective disengagement.\n\nPatterns indicate a high degree of internal distress with overlapping mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms. The patient reports ongoing worry, somatic complaints, mood symptoms, cognitive disruptions, and feelings of isolation, which are clinically significant and warrant comprehensive assessment for mood and anxiety disorders, as well as screening for trauma-related or dissociative conditions.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and high anxiety levels, necessitating close monitoring. Overall, the symptom profile demonstrates considerable functional impairment and psychological distress, underscoring the need for detailed diagnostic clarification and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about your current experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a very difficult time. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling down, hopeless, and lacking interest in activities you once enjoyed</quote>. Additionally, you report significant <sym>anxiety</sym> with constant worries, physical sensations like a racing heart, and avoidance of situations that trigger these feelings. You also described <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and intrusive negative thoughts, which add to your distress. You mentioned feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, questioning your identity, and feeling <sym>isolated from others</sym>. You\u2019ve had some fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is important to take seriously, and you experience some physical discomfort and tension as well. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, all contributing to your sense of distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, lasting over a two-week period. The high level of <sym> worry</sym>, <sym>hyperarousal</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate significant <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as <sym>depersonalization</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and identity questioning suggests dissociative features that may be associated with trauma-related processes. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>check behaviors</sym>, and sleep disturbances further support an overlapping mood and anxiety presentation. The transient <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> require careful attention but do not currently indicate active intent or planning. The combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms points toward a complex, comorbid presentation rather than a single diagnosis, but Major Depressive Disorder appears to be the primary concern at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify symptom duration, severity, and history, including trauma history.  \n2. Initiate safety planning and provide immediate support regarding suicidal thoughts, with close monitoring.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and anxiety.  \n4. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Explore trauma-focused therapies if trauma or dissociative symptoms are prominent.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation.  \n7. Regularly monitor symptoms and functional status, adjusting treatment as needed.",
