They report persistent hyperarousal manifesting as muscle tension, sleep disturbances characterized by frequent awakenings and difficulty initiating sleep, and somatic complaints including headaches and bodily tension. The patient exhibits behavioral avoidance, primarily restricting social engagement and exposure to public spaces due to fear of panic attacks, indicating significant functional impairment.\n\nNotable psychological features include episodic depersonalization or derealization, and passive suicidal ideation without active planning, indicating elevated clinical concern for safety. The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance misuse suggests a primary anxiety/depressive disorder spectrum. The patient\u2019s self-reported sense of being misunderstood by healthcare providers and ongoing distress underscores the need for supportive clinical intervention.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized or panic-related anxiety, somatic symptom burden, and risk for suicidality. The current pattern of avoidance behaviors and sleep disruption further exacerbate functional impairment. Risk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and high levels of anxiety-related distress, warranting close monitoring and comprehensive treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing persistent and intense feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, especially related to your ongoing struggles with <sym>panic attacks</sym>. You also mentioned feelings of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by frequent awakenings and difficulty relaxing. It\u2019s clear that your anxiety and physical symptoms, such as <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym>, are significantly affecting your daily life, leading to avoidance of social situations and public spaces due to fear of panic episodes. You\u2019ve also described <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about your panic episodes and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Your experiences reflect a profound level of distress and functional impairment, and your feelings of being misunderstood by healthcare providers add to your sense of frustration and isolation. Your willingness to share openly shows strength, and it\u2019s important to recognize the courage it takes to seek help in this difficult situation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Severe Anxiety Disorder with Depressive Features, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>worry</sym> about future panic attacks, persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, which are characteristic of <med>GAD</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> point toward <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, physical symptoms such as <sym>muscle tension</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and sleep disruptions are common in anxiety and depressive disorders. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and episodes of <sym>depersonalization/derealization</sym> further support a significant anxiety component. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse suggests that these are primarily mood and anxiety-related issues. The passive thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> indicate increased risk and the need for close monitoring. Overall, the symptom profile reflects a complex presentation of severe anxiety with concurrent depressive features, affecting multiple domains of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, including a detailed safety assessment regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n2. Consider starting evidence-based pharmacotherapy targeting both <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depressive symptoms</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n3. Refer for <quote>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</quote> focused on anxiety management, panic disorder, and depression to develop coping skills and reduce avoidance behaviors.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and consider medical consultation if sleep issues persist.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>panic attacks</med> and <med>anxiety management</med> techniques, including grounding and relaxation exercises.\n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication adherence, and safety, especially given the presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.",
