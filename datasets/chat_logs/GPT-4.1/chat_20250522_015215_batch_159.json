This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a helpful tool to identify any symptoms that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I will ask you each question one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly about how you've been feeling or functioning recently. Are you ready to begin?"

Your sleep difficulties include <sym>trouble falling asleep and waking frequently, often with racing thoughts</sym>. Cognitive concerns, like <sym>forgetfulness and feeling disoriented in familiar places</sym>, are also present. You mention feeling <sym>detached from yourself and disconnected from others</sym>, and social withdrawal has increased.

You also do not use substances or take medications improperly. Your overall picture indicates a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms, accompanied by somatic complaints and dissociative experiences, which suggest a significant impact on your functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and somatic symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>worry, feeling on edge, physical tension, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues like forgetfulness, and dissociative feelings further support an overlapping anxiety component. The absence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than a psychotic or substance-related condition. The physical complaints appear to be somatic manifestations linked to anxiety and depression rather than a primary somatic disorder. The overall presentation indicates a severe mood and anxiety disorder impacting multiple aspects of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Consider a combination of <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications) and <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address both mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and possibly short-term medication management if appropriate.\n4. Monitor for any worsening of symptoms or emergence of suicidal thoughts and provide safety planning if needed.\n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to help reduce physical tension and dissociative experiences.\n6. Consider a referral to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, for ongoing evaluation and tailored treatment.",

Concurrently, there are prominent symptoms of anxiety, including persistent worry, feeling on edge, panic-like symptoms (e.g., racing heart, difficulty breathing), avoidance behaviors, and physical manifestations such as muscle tension and stomachaches. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, compounded by racing thoughts. Cognitive concerns include increased distractibility, forgetfulness, and disorientation in familiar environments, suggestive of potential cognitive or attentional impairments associated with heightened anxiety or mood disturbance. There are also reports of depersonalization or derealization experiences, indicative of dissociative symptoms often linked to anxiety or stress responses.\n\nThe patient denies suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, psychotic phenomena (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), and substance misuse. There is minimal evidence of impulsivity or risk-taking behaviors. Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection from others and oneself are notable, aligning with depressive and social withdrawal symptoms.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring symptoms of depression and anxiety, with pervasive worry, irritability, and mood disturbances.\n- Sleep disruption and physical tension suggest somatic components associated with anxiety disorders.\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances (dissociation) may indicate high distress levels or underlying dissociative features.\n- No current indications of self-harm or substance abuse based on self-report.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and overwhelming distress, although no suicidal ideation reported.\n- Chronic irritability and social withdrawal, which may impair functioning.\n- Physical symptoms (muscle tension, stomachaches) linked to anxiety and stress.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex presentation featuring symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, anxiety, sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences. The absence of current suicidal ideation is noted, but the severity and interference of symptoms warrant comprehensive clinical evaluation and potential targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that significantly affect your daily life. You feel <sym>persistent sadness and hopelessness</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also report feeling <sym>high levels of anxiety, worry, and being on edge</sym>, along with <sym>physical symptoms such as muscle tension, stomachaches, and trouble sleeping</sym>. Your sleep difficulties include <sym>trouble falling asleep and waking frequently, often with racing thoughts</sym>. Cognitive concerns, like <sym>forgetfulness and feeling disoriented in familiar places</sym>, are also present. You mention feeling <sym>detached from yourself and disconnected from others</sym>, and social withdrawal has increased. Despite these distressing symptoms, you have not experienced <quote>thoughts of harming yourself</quote> or <quote>hearing voices or experiencing hallucinations</quote>. You also do not use substances or take medications improperly. Your overall picture indicates a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms, accompanied by somatic complaints and dissociative experiences, which suggest a significant impact on your functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and somatic symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>worry, feeling on edge, physical tension, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues like forgetfulness, and dissociative feelings further support an overlapping anxiety component. The absence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than a psychotic or substance-related condition. The physical complaints appear to be somatic manifestations linked to anxiety and depression rather than a primary somatic disorder. The overall presentation indicates a severe mood and anxiety disorder impacting multiple aspects of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Consider a combination of <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications) and <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address both mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and possibly short-term medication management if appropriate.\n4. Monitor for any worsening of symptoms or emergence of suicidal thoughts and provide safety planning if needed.\n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to help reduce physical tension and dissociative experiences.\n6. Consider a referral to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, for ongoing evaluation and tailored treatment.",
