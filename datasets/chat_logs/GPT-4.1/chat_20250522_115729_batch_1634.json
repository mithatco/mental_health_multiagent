I want to assure you that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. We'll go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I'd like you to respond honestly about how you've been feeling. Are you ready to get started?"

Key symptoms include anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and withdrawal during depressive states, alongside decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, risky behaviors, and heightened energy during manic phases. Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, with reports of nervousness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort are noted, potentially reflecting somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Cognitive symptoms include concentration difficulties and episodic disorientation or depersonalization. There are indications of impulsivity and transient psychotic-like experiences, such as intrusive negative thoughts and urges, though hallucinations and thought broadcasting are absent. Substance use includes episodic alcohol consumption, marijuana use, and cigarette smoking, with some use aligned with mood states. The patient reports periods of social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and identity confusion, especially during depressive episodes. Risk factors include mood instability, impulsivity, substance use, and suicidal ideation without active plans, indicating moderate suicide risk. Overall, the presentation suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid anxiety features and somatic complaints, warranting comprehensive assessment and formulation of an integrated treatment plan.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and challenging picture of your mental health, marked by significant mood swings, including episodes of depression characterized by <sym>loss of interest, hopelessness, and withdrawal</sym>. During your <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym>, you experience <sym>reduced sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and a tendency to start many new projects</sym>. You also described feeling <sym>anxious, worried, and experiencing panic attacks</sym>, along with somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort</sym>. Your experiences of <sym>identity confusion, emotional numbness, and social withdrawal</sym> during depressive states, combined with episodes of <sym>impulsivity and impulsive urges</sym>, suggest a pattern of mood instability. It's clear you're going through a lot, and your symptoms are affecting multiple areas of your life, including your relationships and overall well-being. Thank you for being open and sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode mixed</med> with prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and somatic complaints, potentially indicating comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>episodes of depression</sym> with <sym>hopelessness, anhedonia, and withdrawal</sym>, along with <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, risky behaviors, and impulsivity</sym>, strongly suggests a <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>psychomotor agitation, grandiosity, and episodic mood shifts</sym> supports this diagnosis. The concurrent anxiety symptoms, including <sym>panic attacks, worry, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, are common comorbidities in bipolar spectrum disorders. The somatic complaints such as <sym>headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort</sym> may reflect somatic manifestations related to the mood episodes or underlying somatic symptom considerations. While there are no indications of hallucinations or persistent psychotic symptoms, the overall pattern aligns with a bipolar mood disorder with mixed features, requiring careful assessment and management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation** to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical or neurological conditions.  \n2. **Development of a mood stabilization treatment plan**, potentially including medications such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, under close psychiatric supervision.  \n3. **Psychotherapy**, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help manage mood swings, anxiety symptoms, and impulsive behaviors.  \n4. **Monitoring and management of substance use**, particularly alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco, which can impact mood stability and overall health.  \n5. **Regular follow-up and support**, including psychoeducation about bipolar disorder and strategies for early identification of mood episodes.",
