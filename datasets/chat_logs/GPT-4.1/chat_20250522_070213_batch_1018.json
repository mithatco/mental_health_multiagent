This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. You can answer honestly and openly, and if you're unsure about a question or prefer not to answer, just let me know. Are you ready for us to begin with the first question?"

You sometimes feel <sym>dissociated</sym>, as if you're observing yourself from outside, and have thoughts about <sym>death</sym> or wishing you weren't here, which are very concerning. Your somatic complaints and social withdrawal further indicate the severity of your distress. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress and Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> over the past two weeks are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The notable sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints support a severe presentation. The presence of excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym>, point to <med>Dissociative Features</med> often seen in severe depression and anxiety states. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> raise concern for risk, although no active plans are reported. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, dissociative, and somatic symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxious and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of symptoms, suicide risk, and possible comorbidities.\n2. Consider starting or adjusting <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, under psychiatric supervision.\n3. Engage in <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, focused on managing depressive and anxious symptoms.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, pharmacologic options.\n5. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or <sym>self-harm risk</sym>, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n6. Evaluate for possible medical causes of somatic symptoms and coordinate with primary care providers if necessary.\n7. Explore additional supports, such as social services or support groups, to reduce isolation and enhance social engagement.",

The reported anhedonia, low mood, and anhedonic engagement with previously enjoyed activities suggest major depressive symptoms. Additionally, the patient endorses persistent sleep disturbances characterized by early morning awakenings and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), alongside cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation (Q16). \n\nAnxiety features are prominent, with reports of excessive worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggesting comorbid anxiety symptomatology. The presence of intrusive, dark thoughts (Q17) and passive death ideation (Q12) highlight internal distress and potential risk factors for suicidality, although no current plans or intent are indicated. The patient also reports somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and pains (Q10), which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nDissociative experiences are noted, with feelings of detachment and depersonalization (Q19), further complicating the clinical picture. The patient's irritability and irritability-related behavior (Q4) align with mood dysregulation. No evidence suggests psychotic features or substance misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder, particularly major depressive disorder with anxious features; suicidality risk considerations; dissociative symptoms; and somatic complaints. The presence of passive death thoughts warrants ongoing monitoring, especially given the patient's hopelessness and social withdrawal.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation reflects a complex affective disorder with prominent depressive, anxious, and dissociative features, necessitating comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a profound sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling disconnected from activities and relationships that once brought you joy. You're experiencing persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, difficulty sleeping, and cognitive challenges such as forgetfulness and disorientation. Anxiety is also a significant part of your experience, with frequent worries, sudden <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. You sometimes feel <sym>dissociated</sym>, as if you're observing yourself from outside, and have thoughts about <sym>death</sym> or wishing you weren't here, which are very concerning. Your somatic complaints and social withdrawal further indicate the severity of your distress. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress and Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> over the past two weeks are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The notable sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints support a severe presentation. The presence of excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym>, point to <med>Dissociative Features</med> often seen in severe depression and anxiety states. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> raise concern for risk, although no active plans are reported. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, dissociative, and somatic symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxious and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of symptoms, suicide risk, and possible comorbidities.\n2. Consider starting or adjusting <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, under psychiatric supervision.\n3. Engage in <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, focused on managing depressive and anxious symptoms.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, pharmacologic options.\n5. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or <sym>self-harm risk</sym>, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n6. Evaluate for possible medical causes of somatic symptoms and coordinate with primary care providers if necessary.\n7. Explore additional supports, such as social services or support groups, to reduce isolation and enhance social engagement.",
