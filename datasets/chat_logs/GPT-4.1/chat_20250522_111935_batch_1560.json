You also mentioned <sym>hearing voices</sym> and experiencing <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which can be frightening and isolating. Your sleep has been irregular, with restless nights and difficulty settling down, and you've noticed <sym>memory issues</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Additionally, you have had thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and have engaged in substance use as a way to cope. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very challenging time, and your openness about these symptoms is a positive step toward seeking help and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (voices commenting and arguing), <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym> (belief that others can read or hear thoughts), and experiences of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> suggest psychotic features accompanying the mood disturbance. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and self-harm ideation further support a severe depressive episode with psychosis. Substance use and feelings of disconnection are common comorbidities that can exacerbate the severity of symptoms. Given this constellation, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, with psychotic features</med> appears most fitting, although further assessment is needed to rule out other psychotic or mood disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek immediate mental health evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and ensure safety, including developing a safety plan.  \n2. Consider a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the need for inpatient or outpatient treatment.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, potentially combined with antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms are prominent.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood symptoms, hallucinations, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling or addiction services to reduce risk and improve overall mental health.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, medication adherence, and strategies for managing distress.  \n7. Arrange for regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant affective, psychotic, anxiety, and somatic disturbances. Key features include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and depressed mood over the past two weeks, consistent with depressive symptomatology. The report of persistent irritability and irritability-related outbursts further supports mood dysregulation. Sleep disturbance characterized by insomnia and restlessness is notable, contributing to overall functional impairment.\n\nThe patient reports episodic auditory hallucinations (hearing voices commenting or arguing), paranoid ideation (belief that others can read or hear thoughts), and derealization or depersonalization experiences (feeling disconnected from oneself or surroundings). Such psychotic features raise concern for a primary psychotic disorder or a mood disorder with psychotic features.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of feeling on edge, excessive worry, avoidance of crowded or loud environments, and occasional panic-like sensations. Intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors (checking, washing), and difficulty with memory and orientation suggest possible obsessive-compulsive or dissociative phenomena.\n\nSomatic complaints include unexplained headaches, joint pains, and fluctuating sleep patterns, which may be stress-related or indicative of a somatic component of psychological distress.\n\nThe patient endorses self-harm ideation (\"dark thoughts\"), recent substance use (alcohol bingeing, smoking, and unprescribed medication use), and recent engagement in potentially maladaptive coping strategies, all of which are noteworthy risk factors for self-harm or suicidal behavior.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The combination of depressive symptoms, psychotic features, and anxiety symptoms suggests a complex presentation that may warrant differential diagnosis including major depressive disorder with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, or a severe mood disorder with psychotic and dissociative features.\n- The presence of hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and derealization points toward psychotic processes, necessitating careful assessment of risk and safety.\n- Substance use and self-harm thoughts heighten concern for increased risk of harm, requiring immediate attention and safety planning.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Reported suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\") and intent to self-harm.\n- Psychotic experiences (auditory hallucinations, paranoid thoughts).\n- Substance use (alcohol, unprescribed medications) as maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.\n- Sleep disturbances and somatic complaints that may exacerbate mental health symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a severe, multifaceted psychiatric presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms with psychotic features, prominent anxiety, dissociative experiences, and risky behaviors. These findings indicate a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, immediate risk assessment, and development of a tailored treatment plan addressing mood, psychosis, substance use, and safety concerns.",

While some symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid thoughts) can be present in schizophrenia, the overall profile emphasizes mood disturbance with psychosis rather than the primary psychotic disorder of schizophrenia. The focus on depression, hopelessness, loss of interest, and the context of mood symptoms aligns more closely with major depression with psychosis rather than schizophrenia.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex experience, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to manage these intense feelings and perceptions. It sounds like you've been struggling with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned <sym>hearing voices</sym> and experiencing <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which can be frightening and isolating. Your sleep has been irregular, with restless nights and difficulty settling down, and you've noticed <sym>memory issues</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Additionally, you have had thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and have engaged in substance use as a way to cope. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very challenging time, and your openness about these symptoms is a positive step toward seeking help and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (voices commenting and arguing), <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym> (belief that others can read or hear thoughts), and experiences of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> suggest psychotic features accompanying the mood disturbance. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and self-harm ideation further support a severe depressive episode with psychosis. Substance use and feelings of disconnection are common comorbidities that can exacerbate the severity of symptoms. Given this constellation, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, with psychotic features</med> appears most fitting, although further assessment is needed to rule out other psychotic or mood disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek immediate mental health evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and ensure safety, including developing a safety plan.  \n2. Consider a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the need for inpatient or outpatient treatment.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, potentially combined with antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms are prominent.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood symptoms, hallucinations, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling or addiction services to reduce risk and improve overall mental health.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, medication adherence, and strategies for managing distress.  \n7. Arrange for regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
