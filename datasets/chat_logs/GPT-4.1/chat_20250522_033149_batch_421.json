Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a brief questionnaire designed to help us understand your current mental health and identify any areas that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different aspects of your emotional and mental well-being, and I will ask them one at a time. There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just tell me how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

You have reported persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty sleeping, which has left you feeling exhausted despite sleeping more than usual. Anxiety is also prominent, with frequent worries, physical symptoms like <sym>panic</sym> sensations, and avoidance behaviors, especially in social situations. You\u2019ve also shared feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, coupled with social withdrawal, and some disturbing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you experience physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, which may be related to stress. Your feelings of being disconnected from yourself and others, along with the sense of lost purpose, reflect profound emotional distress. Your openness about these experiences is an important step toward understanding and addressing what you're going through, and I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of dissociation and somatic symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including worry, panic episodes, and avoidance, supports a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Symptoms like feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and emotional numbness suggest dissociative features, which can occur with severe mood and anxiety disorders. The report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a need for safety assessment. Physical complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may be psychosomatic manifestations associated with mood and anxiety symptoms. While somatic symptoms are present, they appear to be secondary to psychological distress rather than indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> alone, as they are intertwined with mood and anxiety features. Overall, the symptom profile aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate the risk of self-harm and establish safety planning if needed.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored for depression and anxiety, possibly combined with medication management if appropriate.  \n3. Collaborate with a psychiatrist to consider pharmacologic options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, based on the severity of symptoms.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and stress management techniques.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and somatic complaints to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing all aspects of your distress.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex mix of emotional, cognitive, and somatic symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily life. You have reported persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty sleeping, which has left you feeling exhausted despite sleeping more than usual. Anxiety is also prominent, with frequent worries, physical symptoms like <sym>panic</sym> sensations, and avoidance behaviors, especially in social situations. You\u2019ve also shared feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, coupled with social withdrawal, and some disturbing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you experience physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, which may be related to stress. Your feelings of being disconnected from yourself and others, along with the sense of lost purpose, reflect profound emotional distress. Your openness about these experiences is an important step toward understanding and addressing what you're going through, and I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of dissociation and somatic symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including worry, panic episodes, and avoidance, supports a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Symptoms like feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and emotional numbness suggest dissociative features, which can occur with severe mood and anxiety disorders. The report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a need for safety assessment. Physical complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may be psychosomatic manifestations associated with mood and anxiety symptoms. While somatic symptoms are present, they appear to be secondary to psychological distress rather than indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> alone, as they are intertwined with mood and anxiety features. Overall, the symptom profile aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate the risk of self-harm and establish safety planning if needed.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored for depression and anxiety, possibly combined with medication management if appropriate.  \n3. Collaborate with a psychiatrist to consider pharmacologic options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, based on the severity of symptoms.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and stress management techniques.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and somatic complaints to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing all aspects of your distress.",
