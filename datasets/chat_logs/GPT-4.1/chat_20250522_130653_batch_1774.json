Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a standard assessment tool used to get a broad overview of different mental health domains and symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your feelings and experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I'll ask you each question one at a time and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You also mentioned feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>exhausted</sym> during the day, despite waking up early and having trouble sleeping. It sounds like these feelings have been overwhelming, and they are impacting your ability to concentrate and connect with others.

The sleep disturbance, concentration problems, and physical complaints support this diagnosis.

The reported experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling detached from self and surroundings indicate possible <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can sometimes be seen in severe depression or related trauma-related conditions. Overall, the symptoms point to a significant mood disorder with associated anxiety and dissociative features, requiring careful monitoring of suicide risk and functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and evaluate suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, considering the patient's symptom profile and preferences.  \n3. Refer to psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or a consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Provide safety planning and ongoing support to address thoughts of self-harm, ensuring the patient has access to crisis resources if needed.",

They report persistent low mood, anhedonia, and passive suicidal ideation without current plans, which warrants close monitoring. Sleep disturbance characterized by early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep is evident, contributing to daytime exhaustion and cognitive impairment. The patient also exhibits affective symptoms such as irritability and increased anxiety, along with somatic complaints including unexplained aches and pains.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a confluence of depressive and anxious symptoms, with notable feelings of emotional detachment, derealization, and identity confusion suggestive of dissociative features or depersonalization. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships further underscore functional impairment. While no psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or paranoid ideation) or substance use are reported, current risk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and significant mood disturbance.\n\nThe patient's responses highlight clinical concerns regarding mood disorder severity, potential underlying anxiety components, and risk of self-harm. The combination of affective dysregulation, cognitive difficulties, and dissociative experiences warrants a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and an integrated treatment approach focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety planning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym> most of the time, along with a loss of <sym>interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>exhausted</sym> during the day, despite waking up early and having trouble sleeping. It sounds like these feelings have been overwhelming, and they are impacting your ability to concentrate and connect with others. You\u2019ve expressed some thoughts of <sym>passive self-harm</sym>, and you have difficulties with <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling <sym>confused</sym> about yourself and your goals. Your symptoms also include <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>physical aches</sym>, which seem to further contribute to your distress. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <sym>anxious features</sym> and possible dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance, concentration problems, and physical complaints support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as worry and avoidance behaviors suggests comorbid <sym>Anxious Features</sym>. The reported experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling detached from self and surroundings indicate possible <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can sometimes be seen in severe depression or related trauma-related conditions. Overall, the symptoms point to a significant mood disorder with associated anxiety and dissociative features, requiring careful monitoring of suicide risk and functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and evaluate suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, considering the patient's symptom profile and preferences.  \n3. Refer to psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or a consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Provide safety planning and ongoing support to address thoughts of self-harm, ensuring the patient has access to crisis resources if needed.",
