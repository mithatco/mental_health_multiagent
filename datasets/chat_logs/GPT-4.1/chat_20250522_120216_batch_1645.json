Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

You also mention feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and reacting with <sym>anger</sym> more easily. Anxiety seems to be a significant challenge, especially in social situations, leading you to <sym>avoid gatherings</sym> and experience <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Sleep problems, including waking multiple times at night and feeling <sym>tired or sluggish</sym> despite sleeping, are affecting your overall functioning. You note some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and intrusive thoughts about social mistakes, which seem to contribute to your distress. Importantly, you have experienced <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, particularly during moments of emotional overwhelm. While you deny any <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as hearing voices or feeling that others can read your mind, your symptoms indicate significant emotional distress and functional impairment that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a need for immediate safety assessment. The absence of psychotic features, compulsive behaviors, or substance misuse points toward mood and anxiety disorder comorbidity rather than other conditions. The cognitive and somatic symptoms, combined with emotional distress, support this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based therapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider consultation with a psychiatrist to evaluate the need for pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication management.  \n5. Encourage the development of coping skills and social support networks to reduce avoidance and improve functioning.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports persistent anhedonia, low mood, and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, accompanied by increased irritability and emotional reactivity. There is notable anxiety, particularly related to social situations, with avoidance behaviors such as steering clear of gatherings. The patient also describes sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining restful sleep, and cognitive concerns evidenced by increased forgetfulness. Recurrent intrusive thoughts centered around social mistakes suggest ruminative tendencies.\n\nThe patient admits to experiencing suicidal ideation during periods of emotional overwhelm, indicating a significant risk factor for self-harm. No reports of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thought content) or compulsive behaviors are present. Somatic complaints include occasional headaches and muscle aches, with no indication of substance misuse or disordered substance use behaviors.\n\nPatterns observed include mood symptoms aligned with features of depression, notably anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms, particularly social anxiety, are prominent, with avoidance and physical sensations consistent with panic episodes. The presence of sleep disruption and cognitive concerns further contribute to the clinical profile.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance** include major depressive symptoms with comorbid social anxiety features, active suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbance. The absence of psychosis or compulsions reduces the likelihood of primary psychotic or obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs** include reported suicidal thoughts and high levels of emotional distress, with avoidance behaviors that may hinder engagement in treatment or social support networks.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation warrants a comprehensive assessment for mood and anxiety disorders, immediate safety planning regarding suicidal ideation, and exploration of social functioning and cognitive concerns.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex mixture of emotional and physical symptoms that have been affecting your daily life over the past two weeks. You report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mention feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and reacting with <sym>anger</sym> more easily. Anxiety seems to be a significant challenge, especially in social situations, leading you to <sym>avoid gatherings</sym> and experience <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Sleep problems, including waking multiple times at night and feeling <sym>tired or sluggish</sym> despite sleeping, are affecting your overall functioning. You note some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and intrusive thoughts about social mistakes, which seem to contribute to your distress. Importantly, you have experienced <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, particularly during moments of emotional overwhelm. While you deny any <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as hearing voices or feeling that others can read your mind, your symptoms indicate significant emotional distress and functional impairment that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>social avoidance</sym> and <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym>, along with physical symptoms like <sym>panic episodes</sym> in social contexts, suggest features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates a need for immediate safety assessment. The absence of psychotic features, compulsive behaviors, or substance misuse points toward mood and anxiety disorder comorbidity rather than other conditions. The cognitive and somatic symptoms, combined with emotional distress, support this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based therapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider consultation with a psychiatrist to evaluate the need for pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication management.  \n5. Encourage the development of coping skills and social support networks to reduce avoidance and improve functioning.",
