Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us identify various symptoms across different mental health domains. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space where you can honestly express what you're experiencing. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, about how you've been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You are experiencing a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, alongside feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and emotional numbness. You also describe frequent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to a traumatic event, such as the accident, which are accompanied by <sym>flashbacks</sym> and distressing images. Your sleep has been disrupted, with frequent awakenings and racing thoughts, contributing to daytime fatigue. Additionally, you experience heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and hypervigilance, leading to avoidance of certain situations like driving. Physical complaints such as headaches and backaches are also present, which may be stress-related. You report using alcohol and tobacco to cope with these feelings, and you've been taking more medications than prescribed, indicating maladaptive coping strategies. These symptoms collectively suggest a significant impact on your emotional and physical well-being, and your feelings of dissociation and identity confusion point toward underlying trauma and mood disturbances.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features, possibly complicated by substance use disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of a traumatic event, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal symptoms such as <sym>panic attacks</sym> and hypervigilance, as well as dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, align with PTSD criteria. The persistent low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness point toward a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The pervasive anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and panic symptoms suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and medications to self-manage distress indicates <med>substance use disorder</med>, which may exacerbate the clinical picture. The combination of trauma-related symptoms, mood disturbance, anxiety, and substance misuse warrants a comprehensive diagnosis of PTSD with depressive and anxiety features, with attention to substance use as a complicating factor.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including a detailed trauma history, suicidal ideation, and substance use evaluation.  \n2. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to help manage depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses, coping strategies, and substance use risks.  \n5. Refer for medical evaluation of physical symptoms and sleep disturbances, potentially involving a sleep specialist.  \n6. Develop a safety plan addressing self-harm thoughts and monitor for suicidality.  \n7. Encourage engagement with support networks or support groups for trauma and emotional health.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, anxiety, and trauma-related features. Key symptoms include pervasive depressed mood characterized by anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent low interest in activities. There are notable cognitive and emotional disturbances, such as intrusive thoughts related to a distressing event, feelings of dissociation (e.g., depersonalization), and difficulty recognizing oneself or understanding personal desires. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with multiple awakenings, racing thoughts, and difficulty returning to sleep. The patient reports increased irritability, irritability, and anger, alongside heightened anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, notably avoiding driving and situations that trigger anxiety. Physical symptoms include somatic complaints such as headaches and backaches, which may be stress-related.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring depressive and anxious symptoms, with evidence of trauma-related re-experiencing (intrusive memories of an accident), hyperarousal (hypervigilance, panic attacks), and dissociative experiences. There are also maladaptive coping mechanisms, including increased alcohol use, tobacco chewing, and misuse of medications (painkillers, sleep aids), suggesting potential substance misuse.\n\nClinical significance involves concerns regarding major depressive episodes, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), given the intrusive memories, hyperarousal, avoidance, and dissociative symptoms. The patient's report of self-harm ideation, albeit passive, warrants careful assessment for suicidality. The substance use to self-medicate further complicates clinical management and poses additional risks.\n\nRisk factors include active suicidal ideation, substance misuse, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors that impair functioning. Warning signs comprise dissociative experiences, intense panic episodes, and increased substance intake, which may escalate risk levels.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe mood and anxiety symptoms with trauma-related features, dissociation, sleep disturbances, and maladaptive coping strategies. These findings necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to delineate the underlying psychiatric conditions and to formulate an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, trauma, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use concerns.",

      "expected": "ptsd",
      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, alongside feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and emotional numbness. You also describe frequent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to a traumatic event, such as the accident, which are accompanied by <sym>flashbacks</sym> and distressing images. Your sleep has been disrupted, with frequent awakenings and racing thoughts, contributing to daytime fatigue. Additionally, you experience heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and hypervigilance, leading to avoidance of certain situations like driving. Physical complaints such as headaches and backaches are also present, which may be stress-related. You report using alcohol and tobacco to cope with these feelings, and you've been taking more medications than prescribed, indicating maladaptive coping strategies. These symptoms collectively suggest a significant impact on your emotional and physical well-being, and your feelings of dissociation and identity confusion point toward underlying trauma and mood disturbances.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features, possibly complicated by substance use disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of a traumatic event, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal symptoms such as <sym>panic attacks</sym> and hypervigilance, as well as dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, align with PTSD criteria. The persistent low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness point toward a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The pervasive anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and panic symptoms suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and medications to self-manage distress indicates <med>substance use disorder</med>, which may exacerbate the clinical picture. The combination of trauma-related symptoms, mood disturbance, anxiety, and substance misuse warrants a comprehensive diagnosis of PTSD with depressive and anxiety features, with attention to substance use as a complicating factor.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including a detailed trauma history, suicidal ideation, and substance use evaluation.  \n2. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to help manage depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses, coping strategies, and substance use risks.  \n5. Refer for medical evaluation of physical symptoms and sleep disturbances, potentially involving a sleep specialist.  \n6. Develop a safety plan addressing self-harm thoughts and monitor for suicidality.  \n7. Encourage engagement with support networks or support groups for trauma and emotional health.",
