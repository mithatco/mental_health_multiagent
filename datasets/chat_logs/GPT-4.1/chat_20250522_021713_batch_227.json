      "content": "You have shared a complex picture of your current mental health state. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling numb and disconnected from activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned episodes of <sym>irritability</sym> and increased <sym>energy</sym> despite less sleep, along with engaging in risky behaviors like starting new projects and substance use. You\u2019ve described <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms such as feeling <sym>restless</sym>, <sym>worried</sym>, and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Physical symptoms like headaches and muscle pains, which your doctor has ruled out medically, suggest psychosomatic concerns. Additionally, you\u2019ve reported some <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of being detached, as well as fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. Your social withdrawal and feelings of confusion about your identity and goals further indicate significant mood and emotional challenges. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a lot, and these symptoms are understandably distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, Current episode manic, severe with mixed features, and comorbid major depressive episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits a pattern consistent with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>, characterized by episodes of <sym>manic</sym> symptoms such as <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>grandiosity</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behavior</sym>, and <sym>pressured speech</sym>. These are combined with depressive symptoms like <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The presence of <sym>mixed features</sym>, including irritability, agitation, and suicidal thoughts, during these episodes, supports this diagnosis. The episodic nature, mood instability, impulsivity, and substance use are consistent with bipolar spectrum pathology. The physical symptoms and anxiety may be secondary or comorbid conditions, but the core features point toward bipolar disorder as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and course of mood episodes.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilizer treatment, such as lithium or valproate, to manage mood swings and prevent future episodes.  \n3. Consider adjunctive psychotherapy, including psychoeducation, to help develop coping strategies and recognize early signs of mood shifts.  \n4. Monitor for suicidality closely, especially given recent fleeting thoughts, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Evaluate and address substance use issues, providing support for reduction or cessation if appropriate.  \n6. Collaborate with medical providers to manage physical symptoms and screen for any medical comorbidities that may affect mental health treatment.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and depressed mood over the past two weeks, accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and psychosomatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and muscle pains. There is evidence of irritability and increased reactivity, suggestive of mood instability, as well as reports of decreased sleep duration with maintained or elevated energy levels, and engagement in high-risk behaviors and impulsivity, characteristic of a possible hypomanic or manic episode.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are minimal, with no reported hallucinations or delusional thoughts; however, the patient reports episodes of dissociation and feelings of detachment under stress. Recurrent ruminative thoughts focus on worries about finances and mistakes, with some compulsive checking behaviors, which may reflect underlying anxiety or obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nThe patient exhibits social withdrawal and anhedonia, aligning with depressive symptomatology. Reports of fleeting suicidal thoughts, without plans or intent, warrant close monitoring. Substance use is notable, with episodes of heavy alcohol consumption during mood episodes and occasional tobacco use, alongside self-directed medication use, indicating potential maladaptive coping strategies and risk for substance misuse.\n\nPatterns suggest episodic mood swings with depressive, manic/hypomanic, and anxious features, alongside impulsivity and substance use. Risk factors include altered sleep patterns, impulsivity, substance misuse, and transient suicidal ideation. The patient's symptomatology warrants comprehensive assessment for mood disorder, possibly bipolar spectrum, along with evaluation of comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders, and monitoring for suicidality.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your current mental health state. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling numb and disconnected from activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned episodes of <sym>irritability</sym> and increased <sym>energy</sym> despite less sleep, along with engaging in risky behaviors like starting new projects and substance use. You\u2019ve described <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms such as feeling <sym>restless</sym>, <sym>worried</sym>, and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Physical symptoms like headaches and muscle pains, which your doctor has ruled out medically, suggest psychosomatic concerns. Additionally, you\u2019ve reported some <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of being detached, as well as fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. Your social withdrawal and feelings of confusion about your identity and goals further indicate significant mood and emotional challenges. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a lot, and these symptoms are understandably distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, Current episode manic, severe with mixed features, and comorbid major depressive episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits a pattern consistent with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>, characterized by episodes of <sym>manic</sym> symptoms such as <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>grandiosity</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behavior</sym>, and <sym>pressured speech</sym>. These are combined with depressive symptoms like <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The presence of <sym>mixed features</sym>, including irritability, agitation, and suicidal thoughts, during these episodes, supports this diagnosis. The episodic nature, mood instability, impulsivity, and substance use are consistent with bipolar spectrum pathology. The physical symptoms and anxiety may be secondary or comorbid conditions, but the core features point toward bipolar disorder as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and course of mood episodes.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilizer treatment, such as lithium or valproate, to manage mood swings and prevent future episodes.  \n3. Consider adjunctive psychotherapy, including psychoeducation, to help develop coping strategies and recognize early signs of mood shifts.  \n4. Monitor for suicidality closely, especially given recent fleeting thoughts, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Evaluate and address substance use issues, providing support for reduction or cessation if appropriate.  \n6. Collaborate with medical providers to manage physical symptoms and screen for any medical comorbidities that may affect mental health treatment.",
