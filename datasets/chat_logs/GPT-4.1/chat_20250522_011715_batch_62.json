Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different domains, and it helps us get a clearer picture of your overall mental health. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open and honest. The assessment involves 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready for us to begin?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent low mood over the past two weeks. Additionally, the patient reports heightened anxiety characterized by frequent worry, constant nervousness, and avoidance behaviors related to social situations. Sleep disturbances, notably difficulty maintaining sleep, and cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness and disorientation are also reported.\n\nThe patient exhibits compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts consistent with obsessive-compulsive features, particularly related to contamination fears and reassurance-seeking behaviors. Dissociative experiences, such as feelings of detachment from self and surroundings, are noted, often during periods of increased anxiety. There is a history of transient suicidal ideation without intent or plans, which warrants careful monitoring.\n\nSubstance use includes episodic alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits and occasional tobacco use, both potentially serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The absence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and no report of current perceptual disturbances suggest the primary symptomatology is mood and anxiety-related rather than psychotic.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The combination of mood symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness) with anxiety features (persistent worry, avoidance, physical tension) suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.\n- Intrusive, repetitive thoughts and compulsive behaviors point toward obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.\n- Dissociative experiences may reflect heightened anxiety or stress response.\n- Sleep and cognitive impairments further exacerbate functional difficulties.\n- The presence of transient suicidal ideation is a significant risk factor requiring ongoing safety assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and fleeting suicidal thoughts indicate a need for close safety monitoring.\n- Substance use as a coping strategy could complicate clinical management and warrants intervention.\n- The severity and persistence of anxiety, mood symptoms, and dissociative experiences highlight the need for comprehensive treatment planning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation featuring major depressive symptoms, significant anxiety, obsessive-compulsive features, dissociative phenomena, and substance use. The symptom profile suggests a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, alongside potential risk for self-harm. A thorough diagnostic formulation and safety assessment are recommended to guide appropriate intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a significant amount of distressing experiences, including persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and ongoing <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also described heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, with constant worries, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance of situations that trigger your anxious feelings. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> suggest a complex picture of emotional and cognitive challenges. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>forgetfulness</sym>, and fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are affecting your daily functioning and overall well-being, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these difficult experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks indicates a significant <med>major depressive episode</med>. The symptoms of constant worry, feeling on edge, avoidance behaviors, and physical tension are consistent with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of intrusive, persistent <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> related to contamination, along with compulsive behaviors such as repeated hand-washing and checking, suggest <med>obsessive-compulsive features</med>. Dissociative experiences during heightened anxiety and the transient <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support a complex mood and anxiety disorder profile. The absence of psychotic features makes a primary psychotic disorder unlikely. Overall, the symptom constellation aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>GAD</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate safety, including a detailed suicide risk assessment.  \n2. Consider a combination of <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, anxiety, and OCD) and <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants such as SSRIs).  \n3. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish regular follow-up to monitor symptom progress and medication effects.  \n4. Educate about sleep hygiene and coping strategies for anxiety and intrusive thoughts.  \n5. Explore additional support services, including support groups or community resources, to bolster ongoing treatment and recovery efforts.",
