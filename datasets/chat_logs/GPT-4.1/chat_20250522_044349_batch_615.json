Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions about your feelings and experiences over the past two weeks. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just honest responses to help us understand your current situation better. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

Your sleep disturbances, cognitive issues like forgetfulness, physical complaints, and emotional numbness further support this combined presentation.

Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting both depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques, including mindfulness or breathing exercises.  \n5. Address sleep issues with sleep hygiene education and possibly a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n6. Monitor for any worsening symptoms or thoughts of self-harm, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n7. Encourage social support and gradual re-engagement with activities and relationships as symptoms improve.",

Concurrently, they exhibit significant anxiety features, including persistent worry, hyperarousal, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, suggestive of comorbid anxiety disorder. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulties falling asleep and fragmented sleep, alongside cognitive complaints such as memory deficits and disorientation, which may reflect heightened stress or underlying neurocognitive concerns. The patient also describes symptoms of derealization or depersonalization, notably feeling numb or detached, and reports somatic complaints including unexplained headaches and stomachaches, which may be psychosomatic or stress-related.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with notable social withdrawal and emotional numbing. The absence of suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, substance use, or compulsive behaviors is noted. Risk factors include the presence of panic attacks, significant functional impairment, and social avoidance, which could impact safety and treatment planning.\n\nOverall, the presentation indicates a complex affective and anxiety disorder with prominent cognitive and somatic features. Further assessment is warranted to clarify the severity, functional impact, and potential underlying neuropsychological or medical contributors.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms lately. These include persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> most of the time, with occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym> that scare you. Sleep has been difficult, with trouble falling asleep and waking up frequently, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>disoriented</sym>. You described episodes of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, as well as <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches that seem related to stress. Additionally, you noted that you\u2019ve been <sym>forgetting small things</sym> and feeling <sym>lost about your identity and life goals</sym>. You also mentioned pulling away from loved ones and feeling <sym>distant</sym> from your relationships. Overall, these symptoms appear to be significantly impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Disorder) with Comorbid Anxiety Disorder (Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The symptoms you described\u2014<sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>\u2014are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>distant</sym> or <sym>detached</sym> point toward a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Your sleep disturbances, cognitive issues like forgetfulness, physical complaints, and emotional numbness further support this combined presentation. While some somatic symptoms could suggest <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, they seem to be more directly related to the overall mood and anxiety symptoms rather than an independent somatic disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting both depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques, including mindfulness or breathing exercises.  \n5. Address sleep issues with sleep hygiene education and possibly a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n6. Monitor for any worsening symptoms or thoughts of self-harm, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n7. Encourage social support and gradual re-engagement with activities and relationships as symptoms improve.",
