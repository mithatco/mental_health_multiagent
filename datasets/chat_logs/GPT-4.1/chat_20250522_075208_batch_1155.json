This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. We will go through 23 questions together, covering different areas like mood, anxiety, trauma, and others. My goal is to get a comprehensive picture of how you've been feeling so I can support you better. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience, and it's clear that you're going through a very challenging time. You've been feeling a persistent sense of <sym>numbness or indifference</sym> toward activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>depressed feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>. These feelings seem to be especially heightened as the anniversary of your accident approaches. You're experiencing <sym>irritability, anxiety, and hypervigilance</sym>, often feeling on edge and having frequent <sym>panic episodes</sym> triggered by loud noises or reminders of the trauma. Sleep disturbances, including frequent awakenings and difficulty feeling rested, are also prominent. You mentioned <sym>intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of the accident</sym>, as well as feelings of <sym>dissociation and depersonalization</sym>. Additionally, you've reported engaging in <sym>substance use and self-critical thoughts</sym>, including thoughts of self-harm. These symptoms are understandably overwhelming and have affected your ability to connect with others and function as usual.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive flashbacks and distressing memories of the trauma</sym>, <sym>avoidance of trauma-related stimuli</sym>, <sym>persistent negative emotional state</sym>, <sym>hyperarousal symptoms such as irritability, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbances</sym>, and dissociative experiences like <sym>depersonalization</sym>. The onset and exacerbation of symptoms around the anniversary of the accident support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, and passive suicidal thoughts</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and misuse of medications, appears to be maladaptive coping mechanisms linked to the trauma and mood symptoms. The combination of trauma-related and mood symptoms indicates a complex presentation requiring integrated management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan, including monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and, if needed, referral to addiction services.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about PTSD and depression, emphasizing the importance of routine, self-care, and social support.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",

There is evidence of anxiety symptomatology characterized by pervasive worry, hypervigilance, irritability, and physical manifestations including tachycardia, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances primarily characterized by frequent nocturnal awakenings and difficulty achieving restorative sleep. The patient reports intrusive, distressing ruminative thoughts and recurrent visual flashbacks of the traumatic event, consistent with post-traumatic stress symptoms. \n\nAdditionally, the patient exhibits dissociative experiences, such as feelings of depersonalization and derealization, and reports episodes of perceived loss of control over thoughts, which may suggest dissociative phenomena. There is evidence of maladaptive coping strategies, including increased alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and misuse of prescribed medications, potentially increasing risk for substance-related complications. The patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without active intent or plan, alongside self-reported dark thoughts during periods of distress.\n\nPatterns observed include a constellation of mood disturbance, hyperarousal, avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding driving, TV content related to trauma), and somatic complaints related to stress. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished emotional engagement suggest significant impairment in interpersonal functioning.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use concerns, and dissociative experiences. The presence of suicidal ideation warrants careful monitoring and safety planning. The complexity and overlap of symptoms highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment to formulate an integrated treatment approach, considering both trauma-focused interventions and mood stabilization.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly identifies PTSD as the primary condition, citing core symptoms such as intrusive flashbacks, avoidance, hyperarousal, dissociation, and symptom exacerbation around trauma anniversaries, all aligning with the expected profile. Additionally, the comorbid depression is common in PTSD presentations, and the reasoning provided supports the PTSD diagnosis. The focus on trauma-related symptoms confirms the alignment.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience, and it's clear that you're going through a very challenging time. You've been feeling a persistent sense of <sym>numbness or indifference</sym> toward activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>depressed feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>. These feelings seem to be especially heightened as the anniversary of your accident approaches. You're experiencing <sym>irritability, anxiety, and hypervigilance</sym>, often feeling on edge and having frequent <sym>panic episodes</sym> triggered by loud noises or reminders of the trauma. Sleep disturbances, including frequent awakenings and difficulty feeling rested, are also prominent. You mentioned <sym>intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of the accident</sym>, as well as feelings of <sym>dissociation and depersonalization</sym>. Additionally, you've reported engaging in <sym>substance use and self-critical thoughts</sym>, including thoughts of self-harm. These symptoms are understandably overwhelming and have affected your ability to connect with others and function as usual.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive flashbacks and distressing memories of the trauma</sym>, <sym>avoidance of trauma-related stimuli</sym>, <sym>persistent negative emotional state</sym>, <sym>hyperarousal symptoms such as irritability, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbances</sym>, and dissociative experiences like <sym>depersonalization</sym>. The onset and exacerbation of symptoms around the anniversary of the accident support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, and passive suicidal thoughts</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and misuse of medications, appears to be maladaptive coping mechanisms linked to the trauma and mood symptoms. The combination of trauma-related and mood symptoms indicates a complex presentation requiring integrated management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan, including monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and, if needed, referral to addiction services.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about PTSD and depression, emphasizing the importance of routine, self-care, and social support.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
