This questionnaire helps us get a broad understanding of different mental health domains that might be affecting you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. We'll go through 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly, sharing as much as you feel comfortable. Are you ready to begin?"

Overall, it sounds like you're struggling with significant mood and anxiety symptoms that impact your daily functioning and sense of self, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>distractibility</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

Although there are no indications of active <sym>psychosis</sym> or <sym>suicidal intent</sym> with plans, passive <sym>death ideation</sym> suggests a risk that warrants close attention. The physical complaints, while possibly stress-related, also require consideration of somatic factors. The combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms suggests a complex clinical picture that needs targeted and comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including risk assessment for suicidality.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants or anxiolytics, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Provide or refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider a sleep study if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.  \n5. Monitor physical health concerns and consider medical evaluation for somatic complaints to rule out underlying medical conditions.  \n6. Offer support for social connectedness and coping strategies to manage avoidance and emotional regulation.",

There is evidence of mood disturbance characterized by persistent low mood and passive death ideation without active suicidal intent, alongside increased irritability and emotional reactivity. Anxiety symptoms are evident through reports of heightened worry, hypervigilance, avoidance behaviors, and a persistent sense of dread. Sleep disturbances are reported as difficulties with sleep initiation and maintenance, coupled with non-restorative sleep despite increased duration, which may exacerbate mood and cognitive concerns.\n\nCognitive and perceptual symptoms include reports of forgetfulness, feelings of detachment (derealization or depersonalization), and difficulty with identity or purpose, suggesting possible dissociative features or cognitive slowing. The patient also describes somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, which may be psychosomatic or stress-related.\n\nThere are notable risk factors including passive death ideation (\u201cwondering if things would be better if I just didn\u2019t wake up\u201d) and dark ruminations, although no active plans or intent to harm self are disclosed. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance use is present.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a constellation of depressive symptoms co-occurring with significant anxiety and somatic complaints, alongside dissociative experiences. The patient's presentation warrants further assessment for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible comorbid dissociative features.\n\nOverall, clinical concerns include mood dysregulation, anxiety, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and passive death ideation, all of which require comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a combination of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>worrying</sym> about various aspects of your life. Sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, are affecting your rest, and you\u2019ve noticed increased <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. You described experiencing <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about not wanting to wake up but clarified that you do not have active <sym>suicidal plans</sym>. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are also present, and you report some <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to your anxiety. Overall, it sounds like you're struggling with significant mood and anxiety symptoms that impact your daily functioning and sense of self, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>distractibility</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The chronic worry, avoidance, and physical symptoms point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014such as feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings\u2014may indicate dissociative features often seen in severe depression or anxiety states. Although there are no indications of active <sym>psychosis</sym> or <sym>suicidal intent</sym> with plans, passive <sym>death ideation</sym> suggests a risk that warrants close attention. The physical complaints, while possibly stress-related, also require consideration of somatic factors. The combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms suggests a complex clinical picture that needs targeted and comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including risk assessment for suicidality.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants or anxiolytics, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Provide or refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider a sleep study if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.  \n5. Monitor physical health concerns and consider medical evaluation for somatic complaints to rule out underlying medical conditions.  \n6. Offer support for social connectedness and coping strategies to manage avoidance and emotional regulation.",
