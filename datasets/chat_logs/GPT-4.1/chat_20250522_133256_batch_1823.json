This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You have had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although you do not intend to act on them, and expressed frustration over feeling misunderstood by medical professionals. Overall, your symptoms indicate a complex presentation involving mood disturbance, severe anxiety, dissociative experiences, and possible psychotic features, which require careful clinical attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and possible <med>Psychotic Features</med> (auditory hallucinations and paranoid sensations).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, marked by episodes of intense fear and physical symptoms, alongside avoidance behaviors, supports a diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>depersonalization</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and confusion about identity suggest significant <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The auditory hallucinations and thoughts of thought broadcasting point toward <med>psychotic features</med>, which can occur in severe mood disorders or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. Given the complexity and severity of symptoms, a comprehensive assessment is necessary to refine the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment strategies.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed psychiatric history and mental status examination, to clarify diagnoses and rule out medical or neurological causes.\n2. Consider hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment if safety concerns (e.g., <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>) are present.\n3. Initiate a coordinated treatment plan that may include pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, antipsychotics) and psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-focused therapy).\n4. Refer for a neuropsychological assessment if dissociative or cognitive symptoms persist or worsen.\n5. Monitor closely for any escalation in symptoms, especially <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan with the patient.\n6. Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatric providers and possibly neurologists, to address the full scope of symptoms.",

There are prominent anxiety features, including persistent worry, tension, and avoidance behaviors related to panic and social situations. Somatic complaints such as headaches and chest tightness are present, alongside sleep disturbances marked by difficulty maintaining restful sleep and feeling unrefreshed. Cognitive concerns include recent memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient also endorses intrusive, distressing thoughts and urges, along with compulsive checking behaviors, suggesting possible obsessive-compulsive features. Dissociative experiences, such as depersonalization and derealization, are described, alongside feelings of identity confusion and social withdrawal, indicating potential dissociative or schizoid features.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms, ongoing panic episodes, and dissociative phenomena. The presence of suicidal ideation, albeit without intent, warrants immediate attention. Psychotic-like experiences such as auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting, combined with paranoid sensations, suggest a potential psychotic component or severe dissociative pathology.\n\nClinically significant areas include major depressive symptoms, generalized and panic anxiety, dissociative experiences, cognitive impairments, and somatic concerns. The patient's social withdrawal and reduced engagement with close relationships further compound the clinical picture.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include reported suicidal thoughts, auditory hallucinations, panic episodes, and dissociative symptoms, all of which necessitate prompt evaluation and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation involving mood disturbance, severe anxiety, dissociative phenomena, psychotic-like experiences, and cognitive impairment, indicating a need for comprehensive psychiatric assessment and potentially urgent intervention to address safety and stabilization.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have experienced a profound <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, coupled with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You described being <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>easily annoyed</sym>, which has affected your interactions with others. Sleep issues are also prominent, with difficulty staying asleep and feeling <sym>restless</sym> despite not sleeping well. You mentioned difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling <sym>disoriented</sym> in familiar places, alongside <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym>. You have experienced <sym>panic attacks</sym>, feeling <sym>terrified</sym> and <sym>out of control</sym>, and have avoided crowded or stressful situations. You also reported <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting sensations</sym>, which are quite distressing. Additionally, you described feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and social withdrawal. You have had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although you do not intend to act on them, and expressed frustration over feeling misunderstood by medical professionals. Overall, your symptoms indicate a complex presentation involving mood disturbance, severe anxiety, dissociative experiences, and possible psychotic features, which require careful clinical attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and possible <med>Psychotic Features</med> (auditory hallucinations and paranoid sensations).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, marked by episodes of intense fear and physical symptoms, alongside avoidance behaviors, supports a diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>depersonalization</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and confusion about identity suggest significant <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The auditory hallucinations and thoughts of thought broadcasting point toward <med>psychotic features</med>, which can occur in severe mood disorders or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. Given the complexity and severity of symptoms, a comprehensive assessment is necessary to refine the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment strategies.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed psychiatric history and mental status examination, to clarify diagnoses and rule out medical or neurological causes.\n2. Consider hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment if safety concerns (e.g., <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>) are present.\n3. Initiate a coordinated treatment plan that may include pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, antipsychotics) and psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-focused therapy).\n4. Refer for a neuropsychological assessment if dissociative or cognitive symptoms persist or worsen.\n5. Monitor closely for any escalation in symptoms, especially <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan with the patient.\n6. Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatric providers and possibly neurologists, to address the full scope of symptoms.",
