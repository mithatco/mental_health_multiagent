      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You often feel <sym>hopeless</sym> about the future and struggle with <sym>irritability</sym>, which sometimes causes you to snap at others. Sleep has been difficult, with frequent awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, yet you still feel restless and full of energy. You experience <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, worrying about saying the wrong thing and feeling overwhelmed by <sym>panic attacks</sym>. These feelings lead you to avoid social interactions, preferring to stay home, which increases your sense of loneliness. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to self-criticism, along with some difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling disoriented at times. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches occur but are mostly attributed to stress. You have had occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, but no active plans or intent. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and cognitive concerns, which are significantly impacting your functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> over two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbances, intrusive negative thoughts, cognitive difficulties, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the marked <sym>fear of social situations</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and worry about negative evaluation are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep problems, specifically difficulty maintaining sleep and feeling restless despite less sleep, are consistent with <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>. The coexistence of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests comorbidity, which is common and warrants integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses, including screening for suicidality and risk factors.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Engage in evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to target social anxiety, depressive thoughts, and behavioral avoidance.  \n4. Address sleep concerns through sleep hygiene education and possibly a sleep specialist referral if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing the importance of routine, social support, and monitoring for worsening symptoms or emergent suicidal thoughts.",

These depressive symptoms are accompanied by increased irritability and anger, as well as sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and difficulty maintaining sleep. Cognitive concerns are evident, notably impaired memory and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient reports intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts related to self-esteem and social anxiety, which contribute to significant avoidance behaviors, particularly in social settings, indicating social phobia or social anxiety disorder. Physical complaints such as headaches and stomachaches are noted but are attributed to stress.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of substantial worry, social fears, and episodic panic attacks, especially related to social interactions or public speaking. The patient exhibits behavioral avoidance consistent with social anxiety, which may reinforce social withdrawal and loneliness. No evidence of psychotic features, dissociative symptoms, or substance misuse is evident. Suicidal ideation is reported as occasional and passive, without intent or plan, representing a potential risk factor requiring monitoring.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.\n- The patient's social avoidance and fear of negative evaluation align with social anxiety disorder.\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment may exacerbate mood symptoms.\n- Passive suicidal thoughts warrant close assessment for future risk.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation, though without current intent or plan.\n- Social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors.\n- Sleep disturbances and intrusive thoughts that could impair functioning.\n- No current substance misuse or psychotic symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a clinical picture characterized by major depressive symptoms, social anxiety features, and associated cognitive and somatic complaints. These findings suggest a complex presentation with significant functional impairment, emphasizing the need for ongoing risk assessment and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You often feel <sym>hopeless</sym> about the future and struggle with <sym>irritability</sym>, which sometimes causes you to snap at others. Sleep has been difficult, with frequent awakenings and difficulty falling back asleep, yet you still feel restless and full of energy. You experience <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, worrying about saying the wrong thing and feeling overwhelmed by <sym>panic attacks</sym>. These feelings lead you to avoid social interactions, preferring to stay home, which increases your sense of loneliness. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to self-criticism, along with some difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling disoriented at times. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches occur but are mostly attributed to stress. You have had occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, but no active plans or intent. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and cognitive concerns, which are significantly impacting your functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> over two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbances, intrusive negative thoughts, cognitive difficulties, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the marked <sym>fear of social situations</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and worry about negative evaluation are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep problems, specifically difficulty maintaining sleep and feeling restless despite less sleep, are consistent with <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>. The coexistence of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests comorbidity, which is common and warrants integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses, including screening for suicidality and risk factors.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Engage in evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to target social anxiety, depressive thoughts, and behavioral avoidance.  \n4. Address sleep concerns through sleep hygiene education and possibly a sleep specialist referral if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing the importance of routine, social support, and monitoring for worsening symptoms or emergent suicidal thoughts.",
