Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

The assessment involves 23 questions covering various aspects of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn.

Your experiences of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thoughts</sym> about thought broadcasting suggest psychotic features, and your difficulties with <sym>memory and disorientation</sym> indicate cognitive impact.

It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very tough time, and these symptoms are affecting your daily life and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizoaffective disorder</med> (provisional impression)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a combination of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thinking</sym>, along with significant <sym>mood disturbance</sym> characterized by <sym>depression, hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>.

The coexistence of <sym>mood symptoms</sym> and <sym>psychotic features</sym> over a period that appears to impact functioning aligns with a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>. The patient's substance use and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> are additional concerns that require comprehensive management. While other possibilities such as <med>major depressive disorder with psychotic features</med> or <med>psychotic disorder not otherwise specified</med> could be considered, the combination and severity of symptoms point toward <med>schizoaffective disorder</med> as the most fitting provisional diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnosis, including evaluating the duration, severity, and impact of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate a multidisciplinary treatment plan that includes antipsychotic medication to address <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, along with mood stabilizers or antidepressants as appropriate.  \n3. Provide psychotherapy focused on coping skills, managing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and substance use.  \n4. Implement safety planning for <sym>self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicidal ideation or behaviors.  \n5. Coordinate care with substance use treatment programs to address <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use.  \n6. Engage family or social supports when possible to enhance the treatment process and reduce social isolation.",

Key symptoms include anhedonia, persistent feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and increased irritability/restlessness. The patient reports significant sleep disturbances\u2014difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep with non-restorative rest\u2014along with cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation. There is notable dissociation, described as feeling detached from self and surroundings, alongside a sense of identity loss and emotional disconnection from others, indicating potential dissociative symptoms.\n\nPsychotic phenomena are evidenced by auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), delusional thoughts of thought broadcasting, and perceptions of external control. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including chronic worry, panic attacks with associated somatic symptoms (e.g., heart racing), and avoidance behaviors. The patient exhibits impulsivity or compulsive tendencies, such as repeated checking and mental routines, alongside reports of risky behaviors and feelings of restlessness.\n\nSubstance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, with recent alcohol consumption and regular tobacco use, coupled with self-administered medication misuse, indicating potential substance use disorder and poor insight into treatment adherence.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include suicidal ideation (thoughts of self-harm), auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, substance misuse, and social withdrawal. These factors warrant urgent clinical attention due to heightened risk for self-harm and potential deterioration of mental health.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests a severe mood disorder with psychotic features, possibly schizoaffective disorder or a psychotic depression, compounded by significant anxiety, dissociative experiences, and substance use issues. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including risk assessment and formulation of a differential diagnosis, is indicated to inform targeted intervention.",

      "expected": "schizophrenia",
      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and distressing set of symptoms that reflect significant challenges across multiple areas of your mental health. You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression and hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of pleasure in activities you once enjoyed. You also report heightened <sym>anxiety, panic attacks</sym>, and a sense of being <sym>dissociated</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, which can be very unsettling. Your experiences of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thoughts</sym> about thought broadcasting suggest psychotic features, and your difficulties with <sym>memory and disorientation</sym> indicate cognitive impact. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym> as a coping mechanism adds further complication to your situation, along with thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very tough time, and these symptoms are affecting your daily life and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizoaffective disorder</med> (provisional impression)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a combination of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional thinking</sym>, along with significant <sym>mood disturbance</sym> characterized by <sym>depression, hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, cognitive issues, and social withdrawal further supports a complex presentation. The coexistence of <sym>mood symptoms</sym> and <sym>psychotic features</sym> over a period that appears to impact functioning aligns with a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>. The patient's substance use and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> are additional concerns that require comprehensive management. While other possibilities such as <med>major depressive disorder with psychotic features</med> or <med>psychotic disorder not otherwise specified</med> could be considered, the combination and severity of symptoms point toward <med>schizoaffective disorder</med> as the most fitting provisional diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnosis, including evaluating the duration, severity, and impact of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate a multidisciplinary treatment plan that includes antipsychotic medication to address <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, along with mood stabilizers or antidepressants as appropriate.  \n3. Provide psychotherapy focused on coping skills, managing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and substance use.  \n4. Implement safety planning for <sym>self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicidal ideation or behaviors.  \n5. Coordinate care with substance use treatment programs to address <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use.  \n6. Engage family or social supports when possible to enhance the treatment process and reduce social isolation.",
