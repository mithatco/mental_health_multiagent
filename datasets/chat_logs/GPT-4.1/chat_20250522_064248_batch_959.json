I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a brief assessment designed to help us understand your current mental health symptoms across different areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential and we're here to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions about how you've been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You've also noted significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, with episodes of both sleeping too much and having trouble sleeping, which leave you feeling exhausted. Anxiety is present, with worries about the future and social avoidance, and you've been dealing with <sym>physical complaints</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, which you associate with stress. You also described a sense of <sym>disconnection from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, along with feelings of being <sym>lost about your identity and direction in life</sym>. Despite these difficulties, you have not reported any thoughts of <sym>self-harm or hallucinations</sym>. Your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and your feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal are particularly concerning and warrant careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of increased irritability, sleep disturbances (both hypersomnia and insomnia), and cognitive issues such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> support this diagnosis. Additionally, the reported <sym>worry and social avoidance</sym> point toward comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The symptoms of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, such as feeling disconnected or watching oneself, indicate <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>, which can sometimes occur with severe depression or anxiety. The absence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance use suggests this is a primary mood and anxiety presentation with dissociative features rather than a psychotic or medical disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to further assess symptom severity, duration, and impact on functioning.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan involving <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (such as antidepressants and possibly anxiolytics) alongside <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).  \n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication management.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal ideation, and ensure safety planning is in place.  \n5. Consider referral to a specialist (e.g., psychiatrist or trauma specialist) if symptoms persist or worsen, especially given the dissociative features.",

Elevated irritability and irritability-related behaviors are reported, alongside marked cognitive and affective symptoms such as forgetfulness, feelings of disconnection (derealization or depersonalization), and a sense of identity confusion. Sleep disturbances are notable, characterized by both hypersomnia and insomnia, contributing to ongoing fatigue and exhaustion.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident, including heightened worry, social withdrawal, and avoidance behaviors, particularly of social situations and places that increase anxiety. The patient reports somatic complaints\u2014headaches and stomachaches\u2014that may be stress-related. Intrusive thoughts about stressors are present, but there is no indication of distressing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions.\n\nPotential risk factors include feelings of hopelessness and self-alienation, as well as social withdrawal. Although there are no current indications of suicidal ideation or self-harm, the depth of hopelessness warrants careful monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a constellation of symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depressive episodes, with comorbid anxiety features and dissociative experiences. The presentation warrants further assessment to clarify diagnostic considerations and to evaluate risk and functional impairment.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently, including persistent <sym>low interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, feelings of <sym>depression and hopelessness</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability and anger</sym>. You've also noted significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, with episodes of both sleeping too much and having trouble sleeping, which leave you feeling exhausted. Anxiety is present, with worries about the future and social avoidance, and you've been dealing with <sym>physical complaints</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, which you associate with stress. You also described a sense of <sym>disconnection from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, along with feelings of being <sym>lost about your identity and direction in life</sym>. Despite these difficulties, you have not reported any thoughts of <sym>self-harm or hallucinations</sym>. Your experiences suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and your feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal are particularly concerning and warrant careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of increased irritability, sleep disturbances (both hypersomnia and insomnia), and cognitive issues such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> support this diagnosis. Additionally, the reported <sym>worry and social avoidance</sym> point toward comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The symptoms of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, such as feeling disconnected or watching oneself, indicate <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>, which can sometimes occur with severe depression or anxiety. The absence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance use suggests this is a primary mood and anxiety presentation with dissociative features rather than a psychotic or medical disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to further assess symptom severity, duration, and impact on functioning.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan involving <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (such as antidepressants and possibly anxiolytics) alongside <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).  \n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication management.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal ideation, and ensure safety planning is in place.  \n5. Consider referral to a specialist (e.g., psychiatrist or trauma specialist) if symptoms persist or worsen, especially given the dissociative features.",
