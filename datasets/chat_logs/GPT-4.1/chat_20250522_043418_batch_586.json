The process involves answering 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words.

No evidence suggests psychosis or other primary psychiatric conditions, but the combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms warrants such an integrated diagnosis. Passive suicidal thoughts highlight the importance of safety assessment and ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on suicidality and safety planning.\n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, and explore trauma or dissociation if relevant.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Encourage establishing a sleep hygiene routine and developing coping strategies for dissociative episodes.\n5. Explore social support options and consider referral to a trauma specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.\n6.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood, anxiety, and dissociative features. Key concerns include pervasive feelings of hopelessness and depression, evidenced by reports of diminished interest in activities, persistent low mood, and feelings of emotional numbness. The patient also reports heightened anxiety, including frequent worry about panic attacks, avoidance of situations perceived as triggers (e.g., public transport, crowded places), and multiple recent panic attacks characterized by physical symptoms such as hyperventilation and tachycardia.\n\nSleep disturbance is prominent, with reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, leading to fatigue and exhaustion during the day. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory lapses and a sense of disconnection from oneself and surroundings, suggestive of dissociative experiences. The patient reports episodes of feeling detached or observing oneself externally, which may reflect dissociative symptoms associated with anxiety or mood dysregulation.\n\nAffective symptoms are compounded by reports of irritability, frustration, and episodic intrusive thoughts, which may contribute to interpersonal withdrawal and social isolation. The patient denies hallucinations, paranoid ideation, or compulsive behaviors, but indicates some impulsivity and a tendency toward ruminative or obsessive thoughts.\n\nThere are no current indications of substance misuse, though the patient acknowledges occasional impulsivity without engaging in risky behaviors or substance use without prescription. Safety concerns are present, as the patient reports recent passive suicidal thoughts without intent or plans, which warrants ongoing assessment.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance**\n- Symptoms align with major depressive features, with anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Elevated anxiety levels, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid panic disorder or an anxiety spectrum disorder.\n- Dissociative experiences and feelings of detachment indicate possible dissociative symptoms often associated with trauma or high stress.\n- Sleep disturbances and cognitive issues may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms, contributing to functional impairment.\n\n**Risk Factors / Warning Signs**\n- Passive suicidal ideation, particularly during overwhelming episodes, highlights the need for safety planning.\n- Chronic anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors increase functional impairment and risk of isolation.\n- Feelings of dissociation and identity confusion suggest emotional distress requiring careful monitoring.\n\n**Summary**\nThe patient exhibits significant depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptoms characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, panic attacks, sleep disruption, and feelings of emotional detachment. These symptoms collectively suggest a complex presentation that warrants a comprehensive diagnostic formulation, with particular attention to suicidality and anxiety management. Further assessment should explore potential trauma history, functional impairment, and the severity of dissociative experiences to inform targeted intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that recently you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical sensations. You describe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a diminished interest in activities you used to enjoy. You're also dealing with significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and difficulty breathing, which lead you to avoid certain situations such as public transport and crowded places. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with <sym>trouble falling asleep</sym> and <sym>waking up exhausted</sym>. You mention episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling detached or outside of yourself, and sometimes feeling <sym>lost about your identity or life direction</sym>. These feelings are compounded by <sym>physical aches</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. While you acknowledge some impulsivity and occasional thoughts of self-harm, you have not acted on these urges. You also report feeling <sym>socially isolated</sym> and disconnected from loved ones, which seems to deepen your distress. Your experiences point to a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms that are causing significant emotional and functional impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and dissociative symptoms (possibly <med>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder</med>).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, loss of interest, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms of anxiety align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014feeling detached from oneself and surroundings\u2014are characteristic of dissociative experiences, which can occur in response to severe stress or trauma. No evidence suggests psychosis or other primary psychiatric conditions, but the combination of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms warrants such an integrated diagnosis. Passive suicidal thoughts highlight the importance of safety assessment and ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on suicidality and safety planning.\n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, and explore trauma or dissociation if relevant.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Encourage establishing a sleep hygiene routine and developing coping strategies for dissociative episodes.\n5. Explore social support options and consider referral to a trauma specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",
