      "content": "You have shared a range of experiences that reflect significant difficulties with <sym>social anxiety</sym>, including persistent worries about <sym>embarrassment</sym> and <sym>fear of losing control</sym> during social interactions. You also describe feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>low interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>withdrawal from social situations</sym>. Sleep problems, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and frequent awakenings, appear to be linked to your anxiety, and you sometimes experience feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> where you feel disconnected from yourself or your surroundings. These symptoms, along with intrusive thoughts about past failures and ongoing social fears, suggest a complex picture involving both <med>social anxiety disorder</med> and features of depression. It\u2019s clear that these struggles are impacting your emotional well-being and daily functioning, and your openness about these experiences is an important step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> features and dissociative experiences\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of intense <sym>anxiety in social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social interactions</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> centered around social fears align with <med>social anxiety disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>low interest</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> point toward a concurrent <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feeling disconnected from oneself or the environment, are indicative of episodes of <med>dissociation</med> often associated with heightened anxiety and stress. The absence of psychotic symptoms, self-harm thoughts, and substance misuse suggests that these features are secondary to anxiety and mood disturbance rather than primary psychotic or substance use disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety and depression.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage anxiety, mood symptoms, and sleep difficulties.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication under medical supervision.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about anxiety and depression, and explore coping skills for managing dissociative feelings.  \n6. Encourage ongoing support, possibly including group therapy for social skills and anxiety management.",

They experience heightened social anxiety, evidenced by frequent worry about social interactions, avoidance of social situations, and panic attacks in social contexts. Additionally, the patient exhibits irritability, especially in response to social cues, and reports difficulty sleeping characterized by insomnia and frequent nocturnal awakenings related to anxiety.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances appear limited, with no reports of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional thinking. However, they describe episodes of dissociation, such as feeling disconnected from themselves and their environment, particularly when overwhelmed. The patient also reports intrusive thoughts about social embarrassments and past failures, which may reflect ruminative tendencies.\n\nThere are no indications of self-harm ideation or substance misuse. The patient\u2019s physical complaints, such as headaches and muscle tension, are likely somatic manifestations of psychological distress. They express feelings of emotional detachment and a sense of uncertain identity, along with diminished interpersonal closeness and trust, consistent with social withdrawal.\n\nPatterns suggest a mood disturbance with prominent social anxiety features, possibly compounded by depressive symptoms. The absence of psychosis, self-harm risk, and substance use are notable. Clinical significance centers on co-occurring anxiety and depression, with dissociative experiences and social avoidance as prominent features. Risk factors include social isolation, potential for worsening depression, and significant functional impairment due to social fears.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder and comorbid depressive features, with dissociative experiences and sleep disturbances that warrant comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of experiences that reflect significant difficulties with <sym>social anxiety</sym>, including persistent worries about <sym>embarrassment</sym> and <sym>fear of losing control</sym> during social interactions. You also describe feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>low interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>withdrawal from social situations</sym>. Sleep problems, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and frequent awakenings, appear to be linked to your anxiety, and you sometimes experience feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> where you feel disconnected from yourself or your surroundings. These symptoms, along with intrusive thoughts about past failures and ongoing social fears, suggest a complex picture involving both <med>social anxiety disorder</med> and features of depression. It\u2019s clear that these struggles are impacting your emotional well-being and daily functioning, and your openness about these experiences is an important step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> features and dissociative experiences\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of intense <sym>anxiety in social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social interactions</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> centered around social fears align with <med>social anxiety disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>low interest</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> point toward a concurrent <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as feeling disconnected from oneself or the environment, are indicative of episodes of <med>dissociation</med> often associated with heightened anxiety and stress. The absence of psychotic symptoms, self-harm thoughts, and substance misuse suggests that these features are secondary to anxiety and mood disturbance rather than primary psychotic or substance use disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety and depression.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage anxiety, mood symptoms, and sleep difficulties.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication under medical supervision.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about anxiety and depression, and explore coping skills for managing dissociative feelings.  \n6. Encourage ongoing support, possibly including group therapy for social skills and anxiety management.",
