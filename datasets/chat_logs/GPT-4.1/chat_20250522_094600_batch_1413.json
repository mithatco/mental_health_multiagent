Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any other underlying or co-occurring conditions.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms, in conjunction with psychotherapy.\n3. Refer for evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, anxiety management, and emotional regulation.\n4. Explore supportive interventions, including psychoeducation, social support enhancement, and possible stress management techniques.\n5.

There are notable affective symptoms characterized by irritability (Q4), pervasive worry, and episodic panic attacks (Q8), suggesting significant anxiety features. Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep along with daytime fatigue (Q15). The patient reports recurrent intrusive thoughts related to past embarrassments (Q17), coupled with feelings of emotional numbness or depersonalization (Q19), and identity confusion (Q20). A sense of social disconnection and feelings of isolation (Q21) further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nPatterns reveal co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with specific phobic avoidance behaviors and panic episodes. The absence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., auditory hallucinations, delusional thoughts) and compulsive behaviors reduces the likelihood of primary psychotic or OCD disorders. However, reported dark thoughts without active suicidal intent (Q12) and physical complaints (Q10) warrant close monitoring.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include feelings of hopelessness, social withdrawal, panic episodes, and passive suicidal ideation. The patient's symptom profile suggests significant distress impacting daily functioning and interpersonal relations.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety features, panic episodes, dissociative experiences, and social withdrawal. Further comprehensive assessment is recommended to delineate diagnostic formulation and inform targeted intervention planning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of distressing experiences over the past two weeks, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>. You also mentioned difficulty <sym>sleeping</sym>, frequent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about past embarrassments, and episodes of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. Your reports of <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>emotional numbness</sym> suggest a significant impact on your daily life, and your experiences of <sym>confusion about your identity</sym> add to the complexity of your current emotional state. I want you to know that these feelings are valid, and seeking help is a strong step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Symptoms such as <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>physical discomfort</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> further support this clinical picture. The absence of psychotic features or compulsions diminishes the likelihood of other diagnoses like <med>schizophrenia</med> or <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative experiences, and functional impairment aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxiety features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any other underlying or co-occurring conditions.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms, in conjunction with psychotherapy.\n3. Refer for evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, anxiety management, and emotional regulation.\n4. Explore supportive interventions, including psychoeducation, social support enhancement, and possible stress management techniques.\n5. Monitor closely for any escalation of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms, and ensure safety planning is in place.",
