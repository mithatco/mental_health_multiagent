This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You've also described hearing <sym>voices</sym> and experiencing <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, which can be frightening.

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a very difficult time, and your openness to sharing these experiences is an important step toward understanding what you\u2019re facing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode mixed, with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's account indicates episodes of both <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>) and <sym>mania/hypomania</sym> (e.g., <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>).

The fluctuating mood states and the severity of symptoms suggest a <med>mixed episode</med>. The patient's history of <sym>substance use</sym> and social withdrawal are common co-occurring issues, but the core features align with a bipolar spectrum disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for other comorbidities.  \n2. Initiate mood-stabilizing medication, such as lithium or valproate, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Consider antipsychotic medication to manage psychotic symptoms during acute episodes.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder and the importance of medication adherence.  \n5. Offer psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood regulation, substance use, and coping skills.  \n6. Ensure safety planning and monitor for suicidal ideation, especially during depressive episodes.  \n7. Coordinate care with addiction specialists if substance use persists.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and medication effects.",

Anxiety symptoms are evident through reports of nervousness, panic-like fears, avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts, while psychotic features are suggested by auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and thought broadcasting experiences. Cognitive disturbances are noted with reports of memory impairment and feelings of detachment or dissociation. The patient also reports social withdrawal, decreased emotional connectedness, and issues with self-identity and existential questioning.\n\nPattern analysis reveals alternating mood states consistent with bipolar disorder, with recent episodes of both depression and mania/hypomania. Risk factors include engagement in risky behaviors (excessive spending, risky projects), substance use (alcohol, tobacco, non-prescribed medications), and passive suicidal ideation without active intent. Psychotic features (auditory hallucinations, thought broadcasting) elevate clinical concern for severe mood episodes with psychotic features.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass mood disorder with psychotic features, bipolar spectrum pathology, co-occurring anxiety disorder, substance use behaviors, and dissociative experiences. The presence of intrusive and paranoid thoughts, along with psychotic phenomena, warrants careful assessment for comorbid psychotic disorders or severe mood episodes with psychosis.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a mood disorder characterized by episodic depression and mania, psychotic symptoms, anxiety features, cognitive disruptions, and self-harm thoughts, compounded by substance use and social withdrawal. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive diagnostic clarification and an integrated treatment approach addressing mood stabilization, psychosis, anxiety management, and safety planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and intense emotional experience, characterized by fluctuating moods, intrusive thoughts, perceptual disturbances, and social withdrawal. It sounds like you've been struggling with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>emotional numbness</sym>, alongside episodes of high energy, risky behaviors, and changes in sleep patterns. You've also described hearing <sym>voices</sym> and experiencing <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, which can be frightening. Your feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and questions about <sym>identity</sym> further suggest a deep sense of confusion and distress. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a very difficult time, and your openness to sharing these experiences is an important step toward understanding what you\u2019re facing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode mixed, with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's account indicates episodes of both <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>) and <sym>mania/hypomania</sym> (e.g., <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>). The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (<quote>sometimes I hear whispers or voices</quote>) and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym> further supports a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med> with psychotic features. The fluctuating mood states and the severity of symptoms suggest a <med>mixed episode</med>. The patient's history of <sym>substance use</sym> and social withdrawal are common co-occurring issues, but the core features align with a bipolar spectrum disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for other comorbidities.  \n2. Initiate mood-stabilizing medication, such as lithium or valproate, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Consider antipsychotic medication to manage psychotic symptoms during acute episodes.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder and the importance of medication adherence.  \n5. Offer psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood regulation, substance use, and coping skills.  \n6. Ensure safety planning and monitor for suicidal ideation, especially during depressive episodes.  \n7. Coordinate care with addiction specialists if substance use persists.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and medication effects.",
