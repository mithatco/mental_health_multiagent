Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand your current mental health symptoms across various domains. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just answer honestly about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of significant anxiety and mood disturbance, including pervasive worry, feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and difficulty with motivation. There is evidence of hyperarousal manifested by irritability, restlessness, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and fragmented sleep. The patient reports cognitive difficulties such as impaired concentration and memory lapses, as well as perceptual disturbances including derealization or depersonalization episodes. Additionally, there are reports of emotional numbing and social withdrawal, suggestive of affective flattening and isolation.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent theme of heightened anxiety, with persistent worry across multiple domains, including health, finances, and social situations, alongside episodic panic-like sensations, especially in crowded or novel environments. The presence of compulsive checking behaviors aligns with features of obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The absence of suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts, and no evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, are noted.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include generalized anxiety disorder, possibly comorbid with depressive symptoms given the anhedonia and hopelessness. The reported dissociative experiences warrant further assessment for dissociative phenomena or trauma-related conditions. The sleep disturbances and physical symptoms (headaches, muscle tension) may exacerbate overall functional impairment.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include elevated anxiety levels, dissociative symptoms, social withdrawal, and sleep disruption, which may increase vulnerability to depressive episodes or self-care deficits if unaddressed. Although no current suicidal ideation is reported, ongoing assessment of risk is advised given the severity of distress and functional impairments.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a high degree of anxiety symptomatology with associated mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, dissociative experiences, and sleep disruption, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing significant distress characterized by persistent <sym>worry and anxiety about various aspects of your life, including health, finances, and social situations</sym>. You report feeling <sym>hopeless about the future</sym> and have noticed a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>difficulty motivating yourself</sym>. You also experience <sym>irritability, restlessness, muscle tension</sym>, and disrupted sleep, often waking multiple times at night and feeling <sym>tired and unrefreshed</sym>. Your concentration and memory seem impaired, and you\u2019ve had episodes of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>. Despite these challenges, you deny <sym>suicidal thoughts or intentions</sym>. These symptoms are causing considerable impairment in your daily functioning and social relationships, and your emotional state appears overwhelmed, with episodes of <sym>panic or intense fear</sym> in certain situations.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with concurrent <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> (mild to moderate), possibly with dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive and uncontrollable <sym>worry and anxiety</sym> across multiple domains, lasting over two weeks, which is characteristic of <med>GAD</med>. The presence of <sym>loss of interest, hopelessness, and impaired motivation</sym> suggests co-occurring <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The physical manifestations such as <sym>muscle tension, headaches, and sleep disturbances</sym> are typical of anxiety disorders. The episodes of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> indicate dissociative features that can sometimes accompany high anxiety states. Importantly, there is no evidence of psychosis or suicidal ideation, which helps narrow the diagnosis. The combination of these symptoms aligns with a primary diagnosis of <med>GAD</med> with depressive features, but further assessment is needed to clarify the severity and impact.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment for <med>comorbid mood, anxiety, and dissociative disorders</med>.  \n2. Consider pharmacological treatment such as SSRIs or SNRIs, which are effective for <med>GAD</med> and depression.  \n3. Refer for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored to anxiety and depression to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if indicated, short-term pharmacotherapy or behavioral interventions.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms or emergence of suicidal thoughts, and provide crisis resources if needed.",
