Notably, there are persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, particularly linked to social avoidance and perceived social judgment. The patient reports heightened anxiety, characterized by excessive worry about social interactions, physiological symptoms such as heart racing and dizziness, and behavioral avoidance of social situations, which further impairs social functioning. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep and non-restorative sleep, are evident, alongside episodic forgetfulness and occasional somatic complaints (headaches, stomach aches) that appear exacerbated by anxiety.\n\nThere are no reports of psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, or compulsive behaviors; however, occasional passive self-harm thoughts are noted, though without intent or planning. The patient denies substance misuse and perceptual disturbances.\n\nResponse patterns suggest a consistent pattern of social anxiety, heightened physiological arousal, and social withdrawal, with secondary depressive symptoms such as anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional numbness. The absence of severe mania, psychosis, or significant substance use minimizes concerns of mood disorder or substance-related pathology at this time.\n\nPotential clinical areas of significance include social anxiety disorder, comorbid depressive symptoms, and possible generalized anxiety features. Vigilance for risk factors such as passive self-harm thoughts is warranted, along with assessment for functional impairment related to social avoidance and mood symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you often feel <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and experience <sym>hopelessness</sym> especially related to social situations and social avoidance. You've mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> frequently, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that include physical symptoms like a racing heart and dizziness. Your worries tend to center around social interactions, leading you to <sym>avoid social situations</sym> and feel <sym>isolated</sym>. Sleep problems, such as difficulty falling asleep and waking up tired, are also present, along with occasional <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> like headaches and stomach aches. You have had some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> but clarify that you do not have any intent or plans. Overall, your experiences suggest significant anxiety related to social situations, accompanied by depressive symptoms like anhedonia and hopelessness, which are impairing your social functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of persistent <sym>fear and avoidance of social situations</sym>, along with intense worry, physiological anxiety symptoms, and behavioral avoidance, align strongly with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and sleep disturbances suggest concurrent <med>depressive features</med>. The episodic <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and somatic complaints are likely related to anxiety and depression rather than a primary medical condition. There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or obsessive-compulsive behaviors, making the primary diagnosis one of social anxiety with depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on social anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n2. Consider a comprehensive assessment for possible pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address anxiety and depression.  \n3. Develop a sleep hygiene plan and explore relaxation techniques to improve sleep quality.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in self-harm thoughts or worsening symptoms, and establish safety planning as needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression, emphasizing that effective treatments are available.",
