This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers different domains like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. The purpose is to gather information that can guide your treatment and support, and I want to assure you that everything you share here is confidential and safe. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared a deeply challenging experience marked by persistent feelings of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where activities that once brought you joy now feel numb or unimportant. You've mentioned feeling overwhelmed most days, with worries about your health, work, and everyday situations that seem difficult to control. Your irritability and increased frustration, especially towards loved ones, are also causing you distress. Sleep difficulties\u2014such as trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up feeling exhausted\u2014are contributing to your fatigue and cognitive issues, like forgetfulness and disorientation. You\u2019ve also reported <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic checking behaviors</sym>, and episodes of feeling detached or outside yourself, which can feel very unsettling. The presence of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> related to self-harm is particularly concerning and warrants careful attention. Overall, it appears you are experiencing a complex mixture of mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative symptoms that significantly impact your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like behaviors, along with dissociative symptoms such as <med>derealization/depersonalization</med>.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation, which are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, physical panic sensations, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbances suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The compulsive checking and intrusive thoughts point toward obsessive-compulsive features. The episodes of feeling detached, as well as experiences of derealization and depersonalization, support a dissociative component. The combination of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms suggests a complex, multi-faceted presentation that may involve overlapping diagnostic categories, but the primary clinical picture aligns most closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and dissociative phenomena.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, especially considering the passive suicidal thoughts.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal ideation, including crisis resources and regular monitoring.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, following a psychiatric consultation.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and dissociative experiences.  \n5. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if necessary, to improve rest and daytime functioning.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and gradual re-engagement with social relationships to reduce isolation.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication effects, and safety.",

Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including excessive worry, difficulty controlling anxious thoughts, physical sensations of panic (e.g., racing heart, shortness of breath), and avoidance behaviors associated with anxiety-provoking situations. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in daytime fatigue. Cognitive concerns include recent memory impairment and disorientation in familiar settings. The patient experiences intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors indicative of possible obsessive-compulsive features. Additionally, derealization or depersonalization episodes and self-disturbance (questioning self-identity and purpose) are reported. There are also indications of social withdrawal and decreased engagement in relationships.\n\n**Patterns and Notable Features:**\n- Co-occurrence of mood and anxiety symptoms, including anhedonia, depressed mood, worry, and panic sensations.\n- Evidence of psychomotor agitation or restlessness, as reflected in restless energy and difficulty relaxing.\n- Sleep disruption compounded by racing thoughts and physical tension.\n- Intrusive, repetitive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggest possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\n- Dissociative experiences (feeling detached or outside oneself) and existential questioning point to derealization/depersonalization phenomena.\n- No evidence of psychotic hallucinations; the patient denies auditory or thought insertion experiences.\n- Social withdrawal and affective flattening are noted, with decreased enjoyment and connection.\n- No substance misuse or non-prescribed medication use reported.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive disorder, given persistent low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- Generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder, considering pervasive worry, panic-like symptoms, and avoidance.\n- Obsessive-compulsive features, suggested by compulsive checking and intrusive thoughts.\n- Dissociative symptoms, including derealization/depersonalization.\n- Sleep disorder, secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- Possible cognitive impairment, warranting further assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Presence of passive suicidal ideation or thoughts of self-harm, which require careful monitoring and safety planning.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and loss of interest as indicators of severe depressive symptoms.\n- Anxiety symptoms with physical sensations (e.g., racing heart) that could escalate to panic attacks.\n- Social withdrawal increases risk of isolation and potential deterioration in mental health.\n- The report of dark thoughts, despite no current plan or intent, necessitates ongoing safety evaluation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation with prominent depressive and anxiety features, including mood disturbance, panic symptoms, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, dissociative phenomena, and sleep disruption. The clinical picture suggests a possible mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and significant functional impairment underscores the need for close clinical monitoring, safety assessment, and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply challenging experience marked by persistent feelings of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where activities that once brought you joy now feel numb or unimportant. You've mentioned feeling overwhelmed most days, with worries about your health, work, and everyday situations that seem difficult to control. Your irritability and increased frustration, especially towards loved ones, are also causing you distress. Sleep difficulties\u2014such as trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up feeling exhausted\u2014are contributing to your fatigue and cognitive issues, like forgetfulness and disorientation. You\u2019ve also reported <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic checking behaviors</sym>, and episodes of feeling detached or outside yourself, which can feel very unsettling. The presence of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> related to self-harm is particularly concerning and warrants careful attention. Overall, it appears you are experiencing a complex mixture of mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative symptoms that significantly impact your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like behaviors, along with dissociative symptoms such as <med>derealization/depersonalization</med>.  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation, which are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, physical panic sensations, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbances suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The compulsive checking and intrusive thoughts point toward obsessive-compulsive features. The episodes of feeling detached, as well as experiences of derealization and depersonalization, support a dissociative component. The combination of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms suggests a complex, multi-faceted presentation that may involve overlapping diagnostic categories, but the primary clinical picture aligns most closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and dissociative phenomena.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, especially considering the passive suicidal thoughts.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal ideation, including crisis resources and regular monitoring.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, following a psychiatric consultation.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and dissociative experiences.  \n5. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if necessary, to improve rest and daytime functioning.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and gradual re-engagement with social relationships to reduce isolation.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication effects, and safety.",
