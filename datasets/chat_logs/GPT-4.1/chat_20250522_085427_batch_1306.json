Reported mood symptoms include persistent low mood, guilt, and thoughts of death without current suicidal intent (A11). The patient also reports heightened anxiety levels, with pervasive worry, racing thoughts, and avoidance behaviors related to social situations (A7, A9). Dissociative experiences are noted, including feelings of detachment from self or environment during emotional distress (A18). Cognitive concerns include impaired memory and concentration (A15), alongside a sense of identity confusion and disconnection from relationships (A19, A20).\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with notable anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal. No evidence of psychotic symptoms, compulsions, or substance misuse is reported, and risk factors for self-harm are limited to passive death wishes without active ideation or plans.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety features, dissociative symptoms, and significant functional impairment related to mood and cognition. The presence of passive death thoughts warrants ongoing monitoring for suicidality. The patient's avoidance and emotional numbing suggest possible social withdrawal and affective dysregulation.\n\nOverall, the patient's symptom profile indicates a complex affective disorder with notable cognitive and dissociative components, requiring comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "The patient expresses a persistent and pervasive sense of <sym>low mood, hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym> that has been ongoing for at least two weeks. They report <sym>loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed</sym>, significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by early waking and difficulty returning to sleep, and feelings of <sym>guilt and worthlessness</sym>. The patient also describes <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including constant worry, racing thoughts, and avoidance of social situations due to fear of feeling overwhelmed or judged. They mention experiencing <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like detachment from themselves or their environment and have noticed <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> such as memory difficulties and trouble concentrating. Additionally, they report experiencing <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> without active suicidal plans, which indicates some level of distress related to their emotional state. Overall, the patient appears to be suffering from a complex presentation involving <med>major depressive disorder</med> with <med>anxiety features</med>, along with dissociative symptoms and significant functional impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with criteria for <med>major depressive disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, guilt, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairments</sym>. The presence of pervasive anxiety symptoms, such as excessive worry, racing thoughts, and social avoidance, supports a diagnosis with <med>anxious distress</med>. The dissociative experiences, like detachment, are indicative of concurrent dissociative symptoms often associated with severe depression. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> suggest a need for careful monitoring of suicidality, although active plans are absent. The absence of psychotic features, compulsions, or substance misuse points toward a primary mood and anxiety disorder without complicating factors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to target depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Recommend engaging in <sym>psychotherapy</sym>, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive thoughts, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n3. Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment and establish safety planning, especially given the passive thoughts of death.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and ongoing psychiatric support.  \n5. Encourage the patient to develop healthy routines, including regular sleep hygiene practices, and explore additional supportive interventions such as mindfulness or relaxation techniques.",
