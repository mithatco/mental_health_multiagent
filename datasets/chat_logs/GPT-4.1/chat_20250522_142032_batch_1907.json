This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a confidential assessment designed to identify areas that might need further attention, and there's no right or wrong answer\u2014just be as honest and open as you can. We'll go through 23 questions covering different domains like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question and you can tell me how you've been feeling or experiencing things. Are you ready to begin?"

You also describe a significant amount of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including constant worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and difficulty sleeping, often waking during the night with your mind racing. You mentioned episodes of <sym>panic</sym> in unfamiliar situations, along with physical symptoms such as muscle tension and stomachaches, which seem to contribute to your sense of distress.

Despite these struggles, you do not report thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychosis</sym>, and you do not use substances or alcohol excessively.

The presence of ongoing <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, physical tension, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> suggest a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal further support an anxiety component. The absence of psychosis, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation makes other diagnoses less likely. The overall pattern indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety features contributing to distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, manage anxiety, and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and physical symptoms, and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce avoidance and social withdrawal.",

Key features include pervasive feelings of anhedonia and hopelessness, consistent with depressive symptomatology, as well as persistent anxiety characterized by excessive worry, restlessness, and difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance. The patient reports heightened irritability, physical tension (muscle aches, headaches), and intrusive, ruminative thoughts of worst-case scenarios, which suggest comorbid anxiety features, potentially of generalized or panic type. There is evidence of avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, and a sense of emotional detachment or social withdrawal, indicating possible social or emotional impact.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent theme of heightened physiological arousal, mood disturbance, and impaired sleep, with no reported history of psychosis or substance misuse. The absence of suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts is noted, reducing immediate risk concerns. However, the patient's self-reported emotional distress and functional impairment warrant further clinical assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety features, possible panic symptoms, and social withdrawal. The patient's physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and sleep disturbance, align with anxiety-related pathology. No current evidence of psychosis or substance use complicates the clinical picture at this time.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs are limited but include high levels of worry, panic episodes, and social withdrawal, which could impact safety and functioning if symptoms escalate. Continued evaluation for mood disorder severity, anxiety severity, and functional impairment is recommended, alongside assessment of potential comorbidities and support systems.",

      "expected": "anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where activities that once brought you joy now feel dull or uninteresting. You also describe a significant amount of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including constant worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and difficulty sleeping, often waking during the night with your mind racing. You mentioned episodes of <sym>panic</sym> in unfamiliar situations, along with physical symptoms such as muscle tension and stomachaches, which seem to contribute to your sense of distress. Additionally, you've noted <sym>avoidance</sym> of certain social situations and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and others, which impact your social connections. Despite these struggles, you do not report thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychosis</sym>, and you do not use substances or alcohol excessively. Your experiences point to a complex picture involving mood and anxiety symptoms that significantly interfere with your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and impact on daily functioning align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, physical tension, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> suggest a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal further support an anxiety component. The absence of psychosis, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation makes other diagnoses less likely. The overall pattern indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety features contributing to distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, manage anxiety, and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and physical symptoms, and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce avoidance and social withdrawal.",
