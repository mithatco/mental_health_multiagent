Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get a broad overview of different mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open about how you've been feeling. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, and physical concerns. I'll ask you each question, and I'd like you to respond based on how you've been feeling during the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The patient reports sleep disturbances marked by insomnia and non-restorative sleep, alongside cognitive concerns such as memory impairment and disorientation. Intrusive thoughts related to anxiety episodes are noted, with occasional dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self or surroundings). The patient admits to suicidal ideation, indicating elevated clinical risk. Substance use appears maladaptive, with increased alcohol consumption and smoking in response to distress, which warrants further assessment. No psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) are reported. The patient\u2019s symptoms suggest comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, with notable risk factors for self-harm.

      "predicted": "You have shared a very detailed and heartfelt account of your experiences over the past two weeks. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with a combination of <sym>persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest</sym>, which suggest a significant <med>depressive disorder</med>. You also described feeling <sym>on edge, worried, and experiencing panic attacks</sym>, along with physical sensations like a racing heart and difficulty relaxing, indicating prominent <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. Your sleep has been disturbed, with difficulty falling asleep and feeling tired despite less sleep, and you've noticed problems with memory and concentration, which can be both symptoms of depression and impacts of anxiety or stress. You\u2019ve mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts and feelings of dissociation</sym>, as well as <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and require careful attention. Additionally, your increased substance use appears to be a maladaptive way to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and stress-related features, with significant risk factors including suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe, with Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>depression</med>, including <sym>low interest, anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, along with sleep disturbance and cognitive issues such as forgetfulness. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, feeling on edge, and panic attacks</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The patient\u2019s report of <sym>intrusive thoughts, dissociative feelings, and thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates a high level of distress and risk, warranting careful monitoring. Substance use (alcohol and smoking) appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy. While no psychotic features are present, the combination of mood, anxiety, and risk factors suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum. These symptoms collectively align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, though further assessment is needed to clarify the severity and specific features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment to evaluate the immediacy of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychiatric treatment</med>, which may include <med>antidepressant medications</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation and anxiety management.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use</med> and explore healthier coping strategies to reduce reliance on alcohol and smoking.  \n4. Refer for a comprehensive physical health assessment to rule out medical conditions that may contribute to or exacerbate psychological symptoms, especially sleep disturbances and cognitive issues.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety, with consideration of involving a multidisciplinary team if needed.",
