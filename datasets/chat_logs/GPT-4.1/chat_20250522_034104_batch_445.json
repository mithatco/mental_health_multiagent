Substance use appears problematic, with recent increases in alcohol consumption (\"drinking quite a bit\") and tobacco use (\"smoking more lately\"), along with non-prescribed use of painkillers and marijuana, which may exacerbate mental health symptoms and pose additional risks.\n\nPattern analysis reveals concurrent mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and substance misuse, suggestive of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, possibly complicated by substance use disorder. The patient's sense of invalidation (\"problems not being taken seriously\") and social withdrawal further contribute to their clinical profile.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-harm risk, cognitive disturbances, and substance use behaviors, warranting comprehensive assessment and urgent intervention to address safety concerns, manage symptoms, and explore underlying psychosocial factors.",

You\u2019ve described experiencing <sym>persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>, which suggests you're struggling with <med>depressive symptoms</med>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious, worried, and sometimes overwhelmed by panic or fear</sym>, indicating significant <med>anxiety features</med>. Additionally, you've reported <sym>intrusive thoughts, memory difficulties, dissociative feelings, and sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be quite distressing. The presence of <sym>thoughts of hurting yourself</sym> is particularly concerning and requires immediate attention. Your recent substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, along with using prescription medications in ways you shouldn't, raises additional health and safety concerns. It\u2019s understandable that feeling <quote>like no one listens or understands</quote> adds to your sense of isolation. Thank you for trusting me with this information; it shows strength in seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments such as memory issues and dissociation</sym>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts, self-harm ideation, and substance use</sym> further complicate the clinical picture and point toward a possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The combination of mood, anxiety, and substance-related symptoms indicates a complex presentation that requires integrated treatment. The patient's feelings of invalidation and social withdrawal also support the need for a comprehensive approach addressing both emotional and social factors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Immediate safety assessment and intervention**, including evaluating the severity of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ensuring the patient\u2019s safety.  \n2. **Referral to a mental health specialist** for comprehensive evaluation, including possible psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy) and psychiatric assessment for medication management.  \n3. **Develop a safety plan** and discuss options for reducing substance use, including resources for addiction support if appropriate.  \n4. **Address sleep and cognitive concerns** through behavioral strategies and possible medical evaluation.  \n5. **Provide psychoeducation** about <med>depression, anxiety, and substance use</med>, and explore social support systems.  \n6. **Schedule regular follow-up** to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",
