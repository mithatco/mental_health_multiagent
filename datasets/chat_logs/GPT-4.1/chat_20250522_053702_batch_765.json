Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

The purpose is to get a broad picture of your current emotional and psychological state, which can help guide any future support or treatment. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different domains such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I will ask you each question one at a time, and I'd like you to respond honestly and as naturally as possible. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms. You've described feelings of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as <sym>fragmented sleep and difficulty waking up rested</sym>, are affecting your daily energy. Cognitive concerns like <sym>forgetfulness and feeling lost in familiar places</sym> are present, alongside <sym>intrusive stressful thoughts</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>. You reported <quote>wishing you could just disappear</quote> without current <sym>suicidal intent</sym>, and you've acknowledged occasional <sym>alcohol use</sym>, primarily when feeling overwhelmed. Overall, these symptoms seem interconnected, impacting your mood, anxiety levels, sleep, cognition, and social engagement, which indicates a complex picture that warrants careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>tearfulness</sym> suggests a significant <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry, restlessness, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, supports a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component. Cognitive and dissociative symptoms such as <sym>forgetfulness, feeling detached, and episodes of derealization</sym> point toward stress-related or dissociative features, which can often occur with severe depression and anxiety. The sleep disturbance and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further highlight the severity, but without active planning or intent, the immediate risk appears moderate. The patient's <sym>alcohol use</sym> may serve as a maladaptive coping strategy, but it does not currently meet criteria for substance use disorder. Overall, the symptoms align with a depressive disorder with prominent anxiety features, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough clinical assessment, including standardized depression and anxiety rating scales, to quantify symptom severity and monitor progress.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, tailored to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene practices and evaluate for underlying medical causes if sleep disturbance persists.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal ideation, and establish safety planning if needed.  \n6. Educate about the impact of alcohol use and discuss strategies for reducing or managing consumption as part of overall mental health care.",

There is notable irritability and increased anger, which may indicate mood dysregulation. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including pervasive worry, restlessness, and episodic panic-like sensations with physiological components such as rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. The patient demonstrates avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, indicating possible social or environmental avoidance patterns.\n\nSleep disturbance is evident, characterized by fragmentation and difficulty maintaining restorative sleep, leading to daytime fatigue. Cognitive concerns include increased forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar settings, raising considerations of cognitive impairment or stress-related cognitive effects. There are intrusive, stressful thoughts and recurrent distressing mental images, reflecting ruminative or obsessive features. The patient reports episodes of depersonalization or derealization, indicative of dissociative experiences.\n\nRegarding suicidality, the patient endorses passive suicidal ideation (\"wishing to disappear\") without current intent or plan, warranting ongoing risk assessment. Substance use patterns include occasional alcohol excess correlating with emotional distress and typical smoking behavior, with no evidence of escalation or problematic use of prescribed medications or illicit substances.\n\nPatterns suggest co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with dissociative experiences and cognitive concerns. The patient's social withdrawal and emotional dysregulation are notable clinical features. No current psychotic symptoms are reported, and there are no explicit indicators of acute safety concerns beyond passive suicidal thoughts.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include depressive symptoms, anxiety spectrum features, dissociative phenomena, sleep disturbance, cognitive complaints, and passive suicidal ideation. Continuous monitoring of suicidality and assessment of functional impairment are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms. You've described feelings of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as <sym>fragmented sleep and difficulty waking up rested</sym>, are affecting your daily energy. Cognitive concerns like <sym>forgetfulness and feeling lost in familiar places</sym> are present, alongside <sym>intrusive stressful thoughts</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>. You reported <quote>wishing you could just disappear</quote> without current <sym>suicidal intent</sym>, and you've acknowledged occasional <sym>alcohol use</sym>, primarily when feeling overwhelmed. Overall, these symptoms seem interconnected, impacting your mood, anxiety levels, sleep, cognition, and social engagement, which indicates a complex picture that warrants careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>tearfulness</sym> suggests a significant <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry, restlessness, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, supports a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component. Cognitive and dissociative symptoms such as <sym>forgetfulness, feeling detached, and episodes of derealization</sym> point toward stress-related or dissociative features, which can often occur with severe depression and anxiety. The sleep disturbance and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further highlight the severity, but without active planning or intent, the immediate risk appears moderate. The patient's <sym>alcohol use</sym> may serve as a maladaptive coping strategy, but it does not currently meet criteria for substance use disorder. Overall, the symptoms align with a depressive disorder with prominent anxiety features, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough clinical assessment, including standardized depression and anxiety rating scales, to quantify symptom severity and monitor progress.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, tailored to address both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene practices and evaluate for underlying medical causes if sleep disturbance persists.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal ideation, and establish safety planning if needed.  \n6. Educate about the impact of alcohol use and discuss strategies for reducing or managing consumption as part of overall mental health care.",
