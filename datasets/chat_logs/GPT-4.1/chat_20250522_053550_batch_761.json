The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym> during elevated episodes, along with <sym>dissociation</sym> and social withdrawal, further supports this diagnosis. The report of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, nicotine, and over-the-counter medications\u2014may be contributing to mood fluctuations and complicating the clinical picture. No psychotic symptoms are reported, which rules out psychotic disorders at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and impact of symptoms.\n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.\n3. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and, if appropriate, referral to addiction treatment services.\n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place, given the patient's thoughts of self-harm.\n5. Collaborate with medical providers to evaluate and manage somatic complaints and physical health concerns.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, anxiety, and substance use to improve insight and coping strategies.\n7. Arrange regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, medication adherence, and any emerging symptoms.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood dysregulation and associated behavioral and somatic concerns. Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and increased irritability and anger. There are notable episodes of decreased sleep coupled with heightened energy levels, alongside increased engagement in risky behaviors and impulsivity, such as initiating multiple projects, impulsive financial decisions, and substance use. Anxiety symptoms are evident, characterized by persistent worry, racing thoughts, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings. The patient reports somatic complaints including unexplained headaches and back pains, as well as subjective experiences of dissociation, feelings of detachment, and social withdrawal. Intrusive negative thoughts are present, especially during depressive states. The patient also discloses recent substance use, including alcohol and increased cigarette consumption, as well as non-prescribed use of over-the-counter medications, suggestive of maladaptive coping mechanisms. No psychotic symptoms are reported.\n\n**Patterns & Clinical Significance**\n- Fluctuating mood states with episodes of depression, mania/hypomania, and irritability.\n- Evidence of impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors during elevated mood phases.\n- Sleep disturbances aligned with mood episodes.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and dissociative experiences.\n- Social withdrawal and emotional detachment.\n- Substance use as a probable maladaptive coping strategy.\n\n**Risk Factors & Warning Signs**\n- Suicidal ideation: thoughts of self-harm, though no intent or plan disclosed.\n- Substance misuse potentially exacerbating mood instability.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors increasing potential for harm.\n- Feelings of dissociation and social withdrawal, which may impact functioning and safety.\n\n**Summary**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation consistent with bipolar spectrum features, including mood episodes with manic/hypomanic and depressive symptoms, compounded by anxiety, dissociative experiences, and substance use. The presence of suicidal ideation warrants careful assessment of safety. The pattern of mood fluctuation, impulsivity, and dissociation suggests a need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and integrated treatment planning addressing mood stabilization, anxiety management, and substance use interventions.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and challenging experience, feeling a mixture of intense mood swings, including periods of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>mania</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. You've described feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>down</sym> most days, alongside episodes where you feel <sym>energetic</sym> and <sym>unstoppable</sym>, often accompanied by <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and impulsive <sym>risky behaviors</sym> like investing and overspending. You also mentioned <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and social withdrawal, which seem to intensify during your low moods. Your concerns about <sym>physical pains</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> appear to be coping mechanisms during these turbulent times. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode mixed</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder (Caffeine, Nicotine, and Alcohol)</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes distinct episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> with decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and increased goal-directed activity, as well as <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. The mood shifts appear to be recurrent and severe enough to cause significant impairment, consistent with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym> during elevated episodes, along with <sym>dissociation</sym> and social withdrawal, further supports this diagnosis. The report of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, nicotine, and over-the-counter medications\u2014may be contributing to mood fluctuations and complicating the clinical picture. No psychotic symptoms are reported, which rules out psychotic disorders at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and impact of symptoms.\n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.\n3. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and, if appropriate, referral to addiction treatment services.\n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place, given the patient's thoughts of self-harm.\n5. Collaborate with medical providers to evaluate and manage somatic complaints and physical health concerns.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, anxiety, and substance use to improve insight and coping strategies.\n7. Arrange regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, medication adherence, and any emerging symptoms.",
