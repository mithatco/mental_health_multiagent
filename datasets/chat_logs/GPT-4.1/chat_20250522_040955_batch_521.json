Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to understand various aspects of your mental well-being over the past two weeks. The purpose is to gather information that can help guide your treatment options. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I will ask you each question one at a time, and I appreciate your openness. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms over the past two weeks. You report persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest or pleasure in activities and a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which seem to weigh heavily on you daily. You also describe heightened <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and feeling hyperactive despite less sleep. Anxiety appears to be a prominent issue, with ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of stressful situations. You mention experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, and episodes of feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've noted <sym>muscle aches</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym>, which you believe are related to stress, and expressed feelings of <sym>being dismissed or misunderstood</sym>. Despite these challenges, you have not reported any thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is important to acknowledge. Overall, your symptoms suggest you are facing significant emotional and physical distress that impacts your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (Severe, with anxious distress features) combined with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and fatigue. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, including feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and being outside of oneself, suggest dissociative experiences often associated with severe emotional distress. The somatic complaints, such as headaches and muscle aches, may be related to psychological stress but could also warrant medical evaluation to rule out physical causes. The absence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>psychotic features</sym> helps refine the diagnosis. Overall, this complex symptom pattern indicates a severe mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative elements.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any underlying or comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants and anxiolytics) and psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral interventions and, if necessary, medical management.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in symptoms, especially suicidal ideation or worsening dissociation, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Consider referrals to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a therapist experienced in trauma and dissociative symptoms.",

Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by difficulties initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, and feelings of restlessness and hyperactivity despite reduced sleep duration. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors targeting situations perceived as stress-inducing. Cognitive concerns include memory lapses and concentration difficulties. The patient also reports intrusive, distressing thoughts, and experiences of dissociation, such as feelings of detachment and being outside of oneself. Somatic complaints, including headaches and muscle aches, are noted, potentially related to psychological stress. Social withdrawal and diminished capacity for emotional connection suggest significant interpersonal and affective impairment.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a pattern of mood symptoms with concurrent anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, indicating a complex presentation with overlapping features of mood and anxiety disorders, possibly with dissociative elements. The absence of suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms is notable.\n\nPotential clinical significance includes major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, panic episodes, and dissociative features, which warrant comprehensive assessment for mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. Risk factors include significant functional impairment, self-reported feelings of being overwhelmed, and social withdrawal. No immediate safety concerns such as suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts are elicited at this time.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests a severe affective and anxiety symptomatology with dissociative experiences, requiring detailed diagnostic clarification and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms over the past two weeks. You report persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest or pleasure in activities and a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which seem to weigh heavily on you daily. You also describe heightened <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and feeling hyperactive despite less sleep. Anxiety appears to be a prominent issue, with ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of stressful situations. You mention experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, and episodes of feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've noted <sym>muscle aches</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym>, which you believe are related to stress, and expressed feelings of <sym>being dismissed or misunderstood</sym>. Despite these challenges, you have not reported any thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which is important to acknowledge. Overall, your symptoms suggest you are facing significant emotional and physical distress that impacts your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (Severe, with anxious distress features) combined with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and fatigue. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, including feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and being outside of oneself, suggest dissociative experiences often associated with severe emotional distress. The somatic complaints, such as headaches and muscle aches, may be related to psychological stress but could also warrant medical evaluation to rule out physical causes. The absence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>psychotic features</sym> helps refine the diagnosis. Overall, this complex symptom pattern indicates a severe mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative elements.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any underlying or comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants and anxiolytics) and psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral interventions and, if necessary, medical management.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in symptoms, especially suicidal ideation or worsening dissociation, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Consider referrals to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a therapist experienced in trauma and dissociative symptoms.",
