I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Key concerns include persistent depressed mood characterized by anhedonia and hopelessness, heightened irritability, and increased anxiety with episodes of panic and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances are prominent, encompassing reduced sleep duration, fragmented sleep quality, and difficulty relaxing. Cognitive impairments are noted, such as memory difficulties and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors are evident, alongside reports of emotional detachment and identity confusion. The patient also exhibits maladaptive coping strategies, including regular tobacco use and recent non-prescribed use of prescription painkillers, which may elevate risk for substance misuse and overdose. Expressed feelings of being misunderstood, social withdrawal, and low engagement with relationships further suggest social isolation. Self-harm ideation emerges as a critical risk factor, warranting immediate attention. Overall, the presentation indicates a complex interplay of mood disorder features with potential comorbid anxiety and trauma-related symptoms, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and safety planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of ongoing distress involving <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also experience heightened <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and avoidance behaviors, especially around <sym>crowded places</sym>. Sleep issues are prominent, with <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and <sym>fragmented sleep quality</sym>. You mention <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, <sym>feelings of dissociation</sym>, and intrusive <sym>thoughts about past mistakes</sym>. Additionally, you report <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym> (including <med>non-prescribed painkillers</med> and <sym>smoking</sym>), and a sense of <sym>detachment from yourself</sym> and <sym>loss of identity</sym>. Your social withdrawal and feelings of being misunderstood further contribute to your distress. It\u2019s clear you are going through a lot, and your symptoms suggest significant emotional and cognitive challenges that require compassionate attention and careful assessment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <sym>anxious features</sym> and <sym>possible trauma-related symptoms</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and identity confusion may reflect trauma-related processes, possibly indicating a trauma-related disorder or complex PTSD, but further assessment is needed. The <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> represent significant risk factors that require immediate attention. The constellation of symptoms indicates a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and trauma features, impacting multiple areas of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to clarify diagnosis, including assessment of trauma history and detailed symptom chronology.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including risk management strategies.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Trauma-Focused Therapy</med> tailored to address depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious symptoms</sym>, especially given the severity and functional impact.  \n5. Explore interventions to improve sleep hygiene and address somatic complaints, possibly involving medical evaluation for physical symptoms.  \n6. Regularly monitor risk factors, including <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, with ongoing safety assessments.",
