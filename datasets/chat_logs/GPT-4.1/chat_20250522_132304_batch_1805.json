We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive environment for you. I will ask you a series of 23 questions about different areas such as mood, anxiety, thoughts, and behaviors. Please answer each question honestly and as openly as you're comfortable. We will go through all the questions one by one, and there's no rush. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It sounds like you are dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and difficulty sleeping. You also experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feel compelled to perform certain rituals, which seem to help temporarily but are distressing nonetheless. Your feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further contribute to your sense of isolation. The presence of <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> indicates significant emotional pain, and the somatic symptoms such as headaches and back pain seem to be adding to your overall distress. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life, and I want to assure you that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med> and <med>Anxiety Symptoms>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> over the past two weeks suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as pervasive worry, hyperarousal, and avoidance of triggering situations point to significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, and passive death ideation further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. While no active suicidal intent is described, the passive thoughts indicate a level of emotional suffering that warrants attention. The combination of mood, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety symptoms suggests a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid obsessive-compulsive and anxiety features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess risk factors, including suicidal ideation.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties (e.g., SSRIs), to target depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on addressing depressive thoughts, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviors, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n6. Explore support systems and consider involving family or close contacts for additional support.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms consistent with comorbid mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive phenomena. The primary concerns include persistent depressive symptoms characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal, alongside significant anxiety manifested as pervasive worry, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive rituals. Sleep disturbance is evident, with reduced sleep duration and fragmented sleep quality due to racing thoughts, which may exacerbate affective and cognitive difficulties. The patient reports intrusive, distressing thoughts with some passive death ideation but denies active suicidal intent or self-harm behaviors. There are also indications of dissociative experiences, such as depersonalization, and cognitive concerns like forgetfulness linked to anxiety.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Endorsement of anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal suggests moderate to severe depressive symptomatology.\n- Elevated anxiety levels, including worry, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors, point toward an anxiety disorder, possibly with obsessive-compulsive features, given the compulsions and intrusive thoughts.\n- The presence of obsessive thoughts, compulsive rituals, and avoidance behaviors align with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.\n- Sleep disturbances and somatic complaints (headaches, back pain) are notable and may contribute to overall functional impairment.\n- Passive death thoughts without active suicidal ideation suggest a need for further risk assessment but do not currently indicate imminent risk.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive disorder with mixed features\n- Obsessive-compulsive disorder or related obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder\n- Generalized anxiety disorder\n- Dissociative experiences linked to anxiety or mood symptoms\n- Risk assessment for passive suicidal ideation\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive death ideation warrants careful monitoring\n- Feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal increase suicide risk, necessitating safety planning\n- Intrusive thoughts and compulsions potentially impair functioning and increase distress\n- No current evidence of active suicidal plans or self-harm behaviors, but ongoing risk assessment is recommended\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits significant depressive symptoms alongside prominent obsessive-compulsive and anxiety features, including intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disruption and somatic complaints further compound the clinical picture. Passive death ideation indicates a need for careful safety monitoring. Overall, the presentation warrants a comprehensive assessment for mood and anxiety disorders, with attention to risk management and development of an integrated treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a difficult and complex experience, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to cope with the range of symptoms you've described. It sounds like you are dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and difficulty sleeping. You also experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feel compelled to perform certain rituals, which seem to help temporarily but are distressing nonetheless. Your feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> further contribute to your sense of isolation. The presence of <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> indicates significant emotional pain, and the somatic symptoms such as headaches and back pain seem to be adding to your overall distress. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life, and I want to assure you that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med> and <med>Anxiety Symptoms>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> over the past two weeks suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as pervasive worry, hyperarousal, and avoidance of triggering situations point to significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, and passive death ideation further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. While no active suicidal intent is described, the passive thoughts indicate a level of emotional suffering that warrants attention. The combination of mood, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety symptoms suggests a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid obsessive-compulsive and anxiety features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess risk factors, including suicidal ideation.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties (e.g., SSRIs), to target depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on addressing depressive thoughts, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or self-harm behaviors, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n6. Explore support systems and consider involving family or close contacts for additional support.",
