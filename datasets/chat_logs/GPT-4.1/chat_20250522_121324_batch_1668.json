We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. This is a self-assessment that helps identify different areas of emotional and psychological well-being. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. There's no rush, and you can take your time to answer honestly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You feel <sym>emotionally numb</sym> and <sym>down</sym>, with persistent <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that make it hard to enjoy activities or see a positive future. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with <sym>significant sleep difficulties</sym>\u2014either sleeping very little or waking up and struggling to fall back asleep. Despite less sleep, you describe feeling <sym>restless</sym> and having <sym>more energy</sym>, which can be confusing. You also report <sym>worrying excessively</sym> about many things, experiencing <sym>panic-like feelings</sym> when overwhelmed, and avoiding situations that trigger your anxiety. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are common, and you sometimes feel <sym>detached</sym> from yourself or your surroundings, which can be unsettling. You mention feeling <sym>lost</sym> about who you are or what you want in life and withdrawing from loved ones, finding it difficult to connect or enjoy relationships. Overall, these symptoms portray a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic concerns, which appear to be significantly impacting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, fitting criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The high levels of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>detachment</sym> from self and environment, along with episodes of feeling unreal or disconnected, suggest <med>dissociative experiences</med>. The physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may also be somatic expressions of psychological distress, but do not alone meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Given the constellation of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and somatic symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders with dissociative features best captures the current clinical picture. Further assessment would be necessary to clarify the extent of dissociation and explore potential underlying trauma or stressors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to assess the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and explore possible trauma or stressors.\n2. Consider initiating <med>psychotherapy</med> options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n3. Evaluate the need for <med>psychiatric medication</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or consultation with a sleep specialist if necessary.\n5. Monitor risk factors, including feelings of hopelessness, and ensure safety with regular check-ins.\n6. Explore support systems and encourage gradual social reconnection to reduce social withdrawal.\n7. If dissociative symptoms or feelings of unreality persist or worsen, consider referral to a specialist in dissociative disorders or trauma-focused therapy.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Summary:\n\nThe patient reports pervasive symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including persistent anhedonia, feelings of depression, hopelessness, and emotional numbness. There is evidence of heightened anxiety manifested through excessive worry, restlessness, panic-like symptoms, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, alongside reports of increased energy levels despite reduced sleep. Cognitive complaints include notable memory impairment and feelings of disconnection from self and surroundings, suggestive of dissociative experiences. The patient also describes somatic symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Additionally, there is a report of social withdrawal and diminished capacity for emotional connection, pointing to interpersonal and affective impairment.\n\nPattern analysis reveals concurrent affective and anxiety symptoms, with some features of agitation or elevated energy states juxtaposed against depression and anhedonia, raising the possibility of mood dysregulation. The dissociative experiences and feelings of unreality are notable and may warrant further exploration for dissociative features or trauma-related factors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal\n- Elevated anxiety, panic, and avoidance behaviors\n- Sleep disturbances with insomnia and possible hyperarousal\n- Dissociative symptoms and feelings of detachment\n- Somatic complaints correlating with psychological stress\n- Cognitive impairments affecting memory and orientation\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal, which may elevate suicide risk\n- Presence of dissociative experiences, which can complicate clinical presentation\n- Restlessness and increased energy levels, possibly indicative of hypomanic or mixed features\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation demonstrates significant mood and anxiety symptomatology with dissociative features and somatic complaints, warranting comprehensive clinical assessment to determine diagnostic formulation and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that you've been experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms over the past two weeks. You feel <sym>emotionally numb</sym> and <sym>down</sym>, with persistent <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that make it hard to enjoy activities or see a positive future. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with <sym>significant sleep difficulties</sym>\u2014either sleeping very little or waking up and struggling to fall back asleep. Despite less sleep, you describe feeling <sym>restless</sym> and having <sym>more energy</sym>, which can be confusing. You also report <sym>worrying excessively</sym> about many things, experiencing <sym>panic-like feelings</sym> when overwhelmed, and avoiding situations that trigger your anxiety. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are common, and you sometimes feel <sym>detached</sym> from yourself or your surroundings, which can be unsettling. You mention feeling <sym>lost</sym> about who you are or what you want in life and withdrawing from loved ones, finding it difficult to connect or enjoy relationships. Overall, these symptoms portray a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic concerns, which appear to be significantly impacting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, fitting criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The high levels of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>detachment</sym> from self and environment, along with episodes of feeling unreal or disconnected, suggest <med>dissociative experiences</med>. The physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may also be somatic expressions of psychological distress, but do not alone meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Given the constellation of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and somatic symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders with dissociative features best captures the current clinical picture. Further assessment would be necessary to clarify the extent of dissociation and explore potential underlying trauma or stressors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to assess the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and explore possible trauma or stressors.\n2. Consider initiating <med>psychotherapy</med> options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n3. Evaluate the need for <med>psychiatric medication</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to help manage mood and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or consultation with a sleep specialist if necessary.\n5. Monitor risk factors, including feelings of hopelessness, and ensure safety with regular check-ins.\n6. Explore support systems and encourage gradual social reconnection to reduce social withdrawal.\n7. If dissociative symptoms or feelings of unreality persist or worsen, consider referral to a specialist in dissociative disorders or trauma-focused therapy.",
