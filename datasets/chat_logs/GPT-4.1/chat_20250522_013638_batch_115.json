This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health by asking about your experiences over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, energy, and more. I'll ask one question at a time and you can answer in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including a detailed history of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate a mood stabilizer (such as lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine) to manage mood swings and reduce the risk of mood episode recurrence.  \n3. Consider antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms persist or significantly impair functioning.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and develop a personalized relapse prevention plan.  \n5. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or psychoeducation, to address mood symptoms, anxiety, and stress management.  \n6. Monitor for safety concerns, including suicidal thoughts, and establish a crisis plan if needed.  \n7. Address comorbid symptoms, including anxiety and dissociation, through appropriate therapeutic interventions.",

Anxiety symptoms are evident, encompassing generalized worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. Psychotic-like phenomena are reported, including auditory hallucinations, thought insertion, and derealization/dissociation experiences, which may suggest brief psychotic symptoms or transient psychotic phenomena related to mood states. The patient also reports somatic complaints such as unexplained aches and pains, and cognitive difficulties including concentration and memory issues, primarily during depressive episodes.\n\nPatterns indicate mood instability with cyclical fluctuations between depressive and hypomanic/manic states, along with psychotic experiences and anxiety symptoms. There is evidence of impulsivity and substance use behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco, along with irregular sleep patterns corresponding to mood episodes. The presence of suicidal ideation (though no active plan or intent) warrants careful attention.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include bipolar disorder with psychotic features, comorbid anxiety disorder, and possible substance use issues. Psychotic symptoms and mood dysregulation heighten the need for careful risk assessment, particularly given reports of passive suicidal thoughts. The patient's experiences of dissociation and perceptual disturbances require further exploration to determine their clinical relevance.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits mood instability consistent with bipolar spectrum features, accompanied by psychotic-like phenomena, anxiety symptoms, and somatic complaints. These findings suggest a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and tailored interventions addressing mood symptoms, psychosis, anxiety, and substance use behaviors.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex array of experiences that suggest significant mood fluctuations, including periods of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless, withdrawing from relationships, and experiencing anhedonia</quote>. At the same time, you described episodes of <sym>elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors</sym>. You also mentioned <sym>psychotic-like experiences</sym> such as <quote>hearing voices and feeling that thoughts can be heard or inserted</quote>, along with symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> like <quote>worrying, panic attacks, and avoidance</quote>. Your report of <sym>intrusive thoughts, dissociation, and physical symptoms like headaches</sym> further reflects a complex mental health picture. It\u2019s clear that you are going through intense and varied emotional states, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I disorder, current episode mixed, with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes clear evidence of <med>bipolar disorder</med> characterized by distinct mood episodes: <sym>depressive episodes</sym> marked by <quote>hopelessness, social withdrawal, and anhedonia</quote> and <sym>hypomanic/manic episodes</sym> evidenced by <quote>decreased sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and elevated energy</quote>. The episodes are also accompanied by <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, such as <quote>hearing voices and feeling that thoughts can be heard or inserted</quote>, which indicates <med>psychotic features</med> associated with mood episodes. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and dissociative experiences further complicate the clinical picture. The symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I disorder</med> due to the severity and duration of mood episodes and the presence of psychosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including a detailed history of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate a mood stabilizer (such as lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine) to manage mood swings and reduce the risk of mood episode recurrence.  \n3. Consider antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms persist or significantly impair functioning.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and develop a personalized relapse prevention plan.  \n5. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or psychoeducation, to address mood symptoms, anxiety, and stress management.  \n6. Monitor for safety concerns, including suicidal thoughts, and establish a crisis plan if needed.  \n7. Address comorbid symptoms, including anxiety and dissociation, through appropriate therapeutic interventions.",
