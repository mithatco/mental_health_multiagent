Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us identify various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing across different areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. I'll ask you each question, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Conduct a thorough clinical interview and consider mood charting or sleep diaries to clarify mood episodes and their duration.\n2. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to assess the need for pharmacologic treatment targeting mood stabilization and anxiety management.\n3. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n4. Address substance use behaviors with integrated addiction counseling or referral to a substance use specialist.\n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation or self-harm risk, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n6.

There are prominent symptoms of irritability, increased energy, and impulsivity, suggestive of mood dysregulation, potentially indicative of a manic or hypomanic episode. Anxiety features are evident, including persistent worry, racing thoughts, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, which may align with an anxiety disorder, possibly generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Sleep disturbances are reported, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, coupled with increased restlessness and fatigue.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are limited to subjective feelings of dissociation or depersonalization, with no evidence of psychotic phenomena such as hallucinations or delusions. The patient reports increased substance use, including alcohol and tobacco, and maladaptive coping via medication misuse, which raises concerns regarding substance-related behaviors and self-medication.\n\nAdditional symptoms include psychomotor agitation, feelings of being misunderstood or invalidated, and social withdrawal, pointing toward social and emotional withdrawal. There are also reports of intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts and compulsive-like mental routines, which may suggest obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nRisk factors of concern include suicidal ideation (passive wishes to disappear or be no one), substance misuse, impulsivity, and recent social withdrawal. While no active suicidal intent or plans are described, these symptoms warrant careful monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation with mood instability, anxiety symptoms, sleep disruption, cognitive concerns, and substance use, indicating a need for comprehensive assessment to clarify diagnostic formulation and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of challenging symptoms that suggest you're experiencing significant distress across multiple areas of your mental health. You've described feelings of <sym>depression, hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym>, along with increased irritability and impulsivity. It\u2019s understandable that these emotions can feel overwhelming and isolating. You also mentioned persistent <sym>worry, racing thoughts, and panic episodes</sym>, combined with sleep difficulties and physical discomforts like headaches and back pain. Additionally, your reports of <sym>substance use, feelings of disconnection from yourself and others, and intrusive thoughts</sym> indicate that you're struggling with emotional regulation and possibly some self-medication behaviors. Your honesty about these experiences is an important step toward understanding and managing what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder, possibly Bipolar II disorder or cyclothymic features) combined with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>low interest, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym>, alongside episodic <sym>increased energy, irritability, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>, which may point to <med>Bipolar disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>worry, panic episodes, avoidance, and racing thoughts</sym> suggests comorbid <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Reports of <sym>substance misuse, including alcohol and tobacco, and medication overuse</sym> indicate possible <med>substance use disorder</med>. The combination of mood instability, anxiety symptoms, and substance use warrants a comprehensive approach, but the episodic nature of some symptoms suggests a bipolar spectrum diagnosis rather than unipolar depression alone.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview and consider mood charting or sleep diaries to clarify mood episodes and their duration.\n2. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to assess the need for pharmacologic treatment targeting mood stabilization and anxiety management.\n3. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n4. Address substance use behaviors with integrated addiction counseling or referral to a substance use specialist.\n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation or self-harm risk, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n6. Consider medical evaluation for physical symptoms like headaches and back pain to rule out underlying medical conditions.",
