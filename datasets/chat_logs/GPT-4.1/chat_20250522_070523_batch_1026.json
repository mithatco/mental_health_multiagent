I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms you've been experiencing over the past two weeks. The goal is to better understand your current mental health status so we can discuss appropriate next steps. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd appreciate your honest responses. Are you ready to get started?"

It sounds like you\u2019ve been going through periods of significant lows, feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>disinterested</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. At other times, you experience <sym>high energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in risky behaviors, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that vary from sleeping very little to sleeping excessively. You've also mentioned feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and some dissociative experiences, as well as thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and warrant careful attention. It\u2019s clear that these mood swings, impulsivity, physical symptoms, and emotional challenges significantly impact your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, mixed features specifier</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports experiencing episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> with increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, alongside episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. The mood fluctuations appear to include both manic/hypomanic and depressive features, with some episodes characterized by <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risky activities</sym>, and <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, while others involve <sym>low energy</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical aches</sym>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further complicate the clinical picture. The variability and intensity of symptoms, along with impulsivity, suggest a diagnosis within the bipolar spectrum, likely <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>, given the history of full manic episodes. The mixed features\u2014simultaneous presence of manic and depressive symptoms\u2014are consistent with the provisional diagnosis. The patient's self-reported substance use, sleep disturbances, and emotional dysregulation are common in bipolar disorder and can exacerbate symptom severity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and rule out other possible conditions such as <med>borderline personality disorder</med>, <med>anxiety disorders</med>, or <med>psychotic features</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, including close monitoring and emergency contacts.  \n3. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer treatment, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy approaches, like <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med>, to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and emotional regulation.  \n5. Address substance use behaviors by providing psychoeducation and possibly involving addiction specialists if needed.  \n6. Establish regular sleep routines and monitor sleep patterns to reduce mood episode triggers.  \n7. Schedule ongoing follow-up to monitor treatment response, adjust medications, and provide support for managing symptoms effectively.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex mood presentation characterized by significant fluctuations indicative of bipolar disorder features, including episodes of elevated mood, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors (e.g., impulsive purchases, increased project initiation, substance use), alongside periods of depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and cognitive difficulties. The reported sleep disturbances are variable and correspond with mood episodes, including hypersomnia during depressive phases and reduced sleep during manic episodes. The patient reports irritability, heightened anxiety, panic episodes, avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, and transient dissociative experiences, suggesting comorbid anxiety symptoms and possible dissociative features. \n\nThere are notable self-reported suicidal ideation (thoughts of self-harm), although without intent or plan, which warrants ongoing risk assessment. Substance use behaviors, including alcohol and tobacco consumption, appear to increase during mood episodes and may complicate the clinical picture. The patient also reports perceptual disturbances such as derealization or depersonalization, and difficulties with identity and interpersonal connectedness, indicating potential features of emotional dysregulation and identity disturbance.\n\nPatterns observed include episodic mood variability aligned with bipolar spectrum features, with concurrent anxiety and dissociative symptoms. The patient's insight into their symptoms and acknowledgment of emotional and behavioral dysregulation are notable.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include bipolar disorder (likely bipolar I or II), comorbid anxiety symptoms, dissociative phenomena, and substance use as a possible maladaptive coping mechanism. The presence of suicidal thoughts, even if fleeting, necessitates careful monitoring. The patient's history of impulsivity and risky behaviors further emphasizes the need for safety planning and comprehensive assessment of mood stability and functioning.\n\nOverall, the symptom profile suggests a mood disorder with mixed features, warranting detailed diagnostic evaluation and integrated treatment planning to address mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and intense range of experiences, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to navigate these fluctuations in mood, energy, thoughts, and physical sensations. It sounds like you\u2019ve been going through periods of significant lows, feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>disinterested</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. At other times, you experience <sym>high energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in risky behaviors, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that vary from sleeping very little to sleeping excessively. You've also mentioned feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and some dissociative experiences, as well as thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and warrant careful attention. It\u2019s clear that these mood swings, impulsivity, physical symptoms, and emotional challenges significantly impact your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, mixed features specifier</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports experiencing episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> with increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, alongside episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. The mood fluctuations appear to include both manic/hypomanic and depressive features, with some episodes characterized by <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risky activities</sym>, and <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, while others involve <sym>low energy</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical aches</sym>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further complicate the clinical picture. The variability and intensity of symptoms, along with impulsivity, suggest a diagnosis within the bipolar spectrum, likely <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>, given the history of full manic episodes. The mixed features\u2014simultaneous presence of manic and depressive symptoms\u2014are consistent with the provisional diagnosis. The patient's self-reported substance use, sleep disturbances, and emotional dysregulation are common in bipolar disorder and can exacerbate symptom severity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and rule out other possible conditions such as <med>borderline personality disorder</med>, <med>anxiety disorders</med>, or <med>psychotic features</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, including close monitoring and emergency contacts.  \n3. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer treatment, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy approaches, like <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med>, to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and emotional regulation.  \n5. Address substance use behaviors by providing psychoeducation and possibly involving addiction specialists if needed.  \n6. Establish regular sleep routines and monitor sleep patterns to reduce mood episode triggers.  \n7. Schedule ongoing follow-up to monitor treatment response, adjust medications, and provide support for managing symptoms effectively.",
