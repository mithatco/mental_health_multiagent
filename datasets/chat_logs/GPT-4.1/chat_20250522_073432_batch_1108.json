I will be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express what you're experiencing. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions covering various domains. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond honestly and openly. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

You also mention difficulty sleeping, with frequent awakenings and trouble falling asleep, alongside physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches. It\u2019s understandable that you feel <sym>detached</sym> at times, and that you\u2019re withdrawing from loved ones. Your worries about your health and future, combined with feelings of being lost and unsure, indicate significant emotional distress.

While there are no indications of psychosis or compulsive behaviors, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of depression with anxiety features. The absence of current suicidal ideation is noted, but ongoing symptoms warrant careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications) and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n2. Conduct a detailed assessment to rule out other comorbid conditions, including trauma-related disorders, and evaluate sleep patterns with sleep diaries or referral to a sleep specialist if needed.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and develop coping strategies to manage panic attacks and intrusive thoughts.  \n4. Establish safety and crisis plans, with regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and response to treatment.",

There is a prominent presentation of generalized anxiety, with persistent worry, especially regarding health and future uncertainties, accompanied by frequent panic attacks and avoidance of public and crowded settings. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by fragmentation and difficulty initiating sleep, alongside reports of increased restlessness and fatigue.\n\nCognitive and perceptual experiences include episodes of dissociation, such as feelings of detachment from self and surroundings, and racing thoughts. The patient also reports increased irritability, tension, and physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches without clear etiology. There are no indications of auditory or visual hallucinations, delusional thoughts, or compulsive behaviors, although some repetitive checking behaviors are noted.\n\nRisk factors include active panic attacks, social withdrawal, and reports of feeling overwhelmed and lost, which suggest significant emotional distress. No current suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts are acknowledged.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Symptomatology aligns with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, with features suggestive of panic disorder.\n- The presence of dissociative feelings and sleep disruption warrants further assessment for potential comorbidities such as post-traumatic stress or dissociative symptoms.\n- The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal indicate possible social anxiety or agoraphobic tendencies.\n\n**Risk Factors / Warning Signs:**\n- Active panic attacks and avoidance behaviors pose risk for functional impairment.\n- Feelings of being lost and overwhelmed require careful monitoring for worsening mood or emergent suicidality, despite the absence of current suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depression, generalized anxiety with panic features, dissociative experiences, and sleep disturbances, compounded by social withdrawal and feelings of emotional overwhelm. These symptoms merit further evaluation and possibly integrated treatment approaches addressing both mood and anxiety components.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past two weeks. You feel <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, and you describe feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> by <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. You also mention difficulty sleeping, with frequent awakenings and trouble falling asleep, alongside physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches. It\u2019s understandable that you feel <sym>detached</sym> at times, and that you\u2019re withdrawing from loved ones. Your worries about your health and future, combined with feelings of being lost and unsure, indicate significant emotional distress. Your experiences are valid, and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests the presence of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Symptoms such as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>physical aches</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> further support this assessment. While there are no indications of psychosis or compulsive behaviors, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of depression with anxiety features. The absence of current suicidal ideation is noted, but ongoing symptoms warrant careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications) and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n2. Conduct a detailed assessment to rule out other comorbid conditions, including trauma-related disorders, and evaluate sleep patterns with sleep diaries or referral to a sleep specialist if needed.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and develop coping strategies to manage panic attacks and intrusive thoughts.  \n4. Establish safety and crisis plans, with regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and response to treatment.",
