You also report increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>worry</sym> about the future, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> seem to be linked to stress. You described episodes of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, which might reflect dissociative experiences, and you\u2019ve expressed a sense of <sym>lost identity</sym>. Despite these struggles, you deny any <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms or <sym>substance misuse</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned occasional <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is concerning and warrants careful attention. I want to acknowledge that sharing these feelings takes courage, and you\u2019re not alone in this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress and features of depersonalization/derealization</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant functional impairment, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of pervasive <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically generalized anxiety symptoms. The dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of identity</sym> indicate features of <med>depersonalization/derealization</med>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may be psychosomatic manifestations of ongoing stress. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitates caution but, since there is no active intent or plan, the diagnosis remains within the depressive spectrum. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative features, and somatic complaints suggests a complex mood disorder with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess the severity of symptoms, risk of self-harm, and any underlying medical conditions.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts, including regular monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy) and evaluating the need for pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants with anxiolytic properties).  \n4. Refer for a medical assessment to rule out physical causes of somatic symptoms and ensure holistic care.  \n5. Explore stress management techniques and coping strategies to help manage anxiety and emotional regulation.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant affective, anxiety, and mood dysregulation. Key features include pervasive anhedonia and emotional numbness, feelings of sadness, hopelessness, irritability, and heightened anxiety characterized by excessive worry and tension. The patient reports sleep disturbances manifesting as insomnia and non-restorative sleep, coupled with cognitive difficulties such as impaired concentration and memory lapses. Somatic complaints, including headaches and stomachaches, are present without clear physical etiology, potentially reflecting psychosomatic manifestations.\n\nNotable perceptual and cognitive symptoms include transient dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached or outside of oneself, and a sense of existential disconnection or loss of identity. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in interpersonal relationships are evident, aligning with mood and anhedonic symptoms. The patient denies psychotic features (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid thoughts) and substance misuse, though reports occasional alcohol intake and significant subjective distress.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts that maybe it would be easier if I just stopped trying\"), persistent hopelessness, and emotional instability. While explicit intent or plan is not disclosed, these symptoms warrant careful monitoring for escalation.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant depressive symptomatology with anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Co-occurring anxiety symptoms, especially worry and tension, with avoidance behaviors.\n- Dissociative experiences and existential distress suggest features of depersonalization/derealization.\n- Sleep and cognitive impairments further compound functional difficulties.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe patient's presentation suggests moderate to severe mood and anxiety symptoms with potential dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts and significant functional impairment underscore the need for comprehensive risk assessment and possible intervention planning. Further evaluation should explore the duration, severity, and impact of these symptoms, alongside assessment for underlying mood or trauma-related disorders.",

Adjustment disorders typically involve a maladaptive response to a specific stressor but do not usually include persistent depressive symptoms with dissociative features as described here. The given diagnosis focuses on a depressive and anxiety spectrum condition rather than an adjustment disorder.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex mix of emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges that have significantly impacted your daily life. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sadness</sym>, and <sym>numbness</sym> that suggest a persistent low mood. You also report increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>worry</sym> about the future, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> seem to be linked to stress. You described episodes of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, which might reflect dissociative experiences, and you\u2019ve expressed a sense of <sym>lost identity</sym>. Despite these struggles, you deny any <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms or <sym>substance misuse</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned occasional <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is concerning and warrants careful attention. I want to acknowledge that sharing these feelings takes courage, and you\u2019re not alone in this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress and features of depersonalization/derealization</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant functional impairment, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of pervasive <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically generalized anxiety symptoms. The dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of identity</sym> indicate features of <med>depersonalization/derealization</med>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may be psychosomatic manifestations of ongoing stress. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitates caution but, since there is no active intent or plan, the diagnosis remains within the depressive spectrum. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative features, and somatic complaints suggests a complex mood disorder with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess the severity of symptoms, risk of self-harm, and any underlying medical conditions.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts, including regular monitoring and support.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy) and evaluating the need for pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants with anxiolytic properties).  \n4. Refer for a medical assessment to rule out physical causes of somatic symptoms and ensure holistic care.  \n5. Explore stress management techniques and coping strategies to help manage anxiety and emotional regulation.",
