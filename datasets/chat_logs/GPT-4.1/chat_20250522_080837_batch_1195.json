You've noticed a significant <sym>loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</sym> and have been withdrawing socially, which makes you feel more isolated. You also mentioned difficulty with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking early and feeling tired during the day, as well as trouble concentrating and experiencing some <sym>unexplained physical aches</sym>. You\u2019ve had fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, though you do not have any plans. While you're not experiencing <sym>hallucinations or paranoid thoughts</sym>, your emotional state and physical symptoms are concerning and suggest a need for ongoing support and assessment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and social withdrawal (Q20), lasting over the past two weeks. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q5, Q15), <sym>concentration difficulties</sym> (Q16), and <sym>physical aches</sym> (Q10) further support this diagnosis. The report of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> (Q12) indicates a need for close monitoring but does not currently suggest active suicidal intent. The absence of psychotic features or manic symptoms makes <med>bipolar disorder</med> unlikely at this time. The irritability (Q4) and somatic complaints are common in <med>depressive episodes</med> and may reflect the patient's distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with safety planning as needed.\n2. Consider initiating <med>evidence-based treatment for depression</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy, depending on patient preference and severity.\n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, medication or behavioral interventions.\n4. Monitor physical symptoms and consider medical evaluation to rule out any somatic or medical causes.\n5. Encourage social connection and support, possibly involving family or support groups.\n6. Schedule follow-up to assess response to treatment and adjust plans accordingly.",

There is evidence of irritability and increased frustration (Q4), alongside sleep disturbance marked by early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). Cognitive complaints include concentration difficulties and forgetfulness (Q16), which may further impact functioning.\n\nAnxious features are limited but include episodic worry about potential adverse outcomes (Q7). The patient reports somatic concerns with unexplained aches and pains (Q10), which could reflect psychosomatic manifestations of underlying distress. Thoughts of self-harm are present but without active plans (Q12), indicating a potential risk factor requiring monitoring.\n\nNotably, there are no indications of psychotic symptoms (Q13, Q14), impulsivity or risky behaviors (Q6, Q18), or substance misuse (Q21\u2013Q23). The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection (Q20) are significant, potentially contributing to or exacerbating depressive states.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Core depressive features with associated sleep and concentration disturbances.\n- Mild irritability and somatic complaints may serve as secondary symptoms.\n- Absence of psychosis or active suicidal intent, though passive self-harm thoughts warrant ongoing assessment.\n- Withdrawal from social connections indicates potential social isolation.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive thoughts of self-harm, though without plans, suggest the need for close monitoring.\n- Persistent low mood, anhedonia, and sleep issues are key targets for intervention.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with moderate depressive symptomatology, with notable features of irritability, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal. Continued assessment of suicide risk, functional impairment, and potential underlying anxiety or other comorbidities is recommended to inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared with me that you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood and feelings of hopelessness</sym> that have been weighing heavily on you. You've noticed a significant <sym>loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</sym> and have been withdrawing socially, which makes you feel more isolated. You also mentioned difficulty with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking early and feeling tired during the day, as well as trouble concentrating and experiencing some <sym>unexplained physical aches</sym>. You\u2019ve had fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, though you do not have any plans. While you're not experiencing <sym>hallucinations or paranoid thoughts</sym>, your emotional state and physical symptoms are concerning and suggest a need for ongoing support and assessment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and social withdrawal (Q20), lasting over the past two weeks. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q5, Q15), <sym>concentration difficulties</sym> (Q16), and <sym>physical aches</sym> (Q10) further support this diagnosis. The report of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> (Q12) indicates a need for close monitoring but does not currently suggest active suicidal intent. The absence of psychotic features or manic symptoms makes <med>bipolar disorder</med> unlikely at this time. The irritability (Q4) and somatic complaints are common in <med>depressive episodes</med> and may reflect the patient's distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with safety planning as needed.\n2. Consider initiating <med>evidence-based treatment for depression</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy, depending on patient preference and severity.\n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, medication or behavioral interventions.\n4. Monitor physical symptoms and consider medical evaluation to rule out any somatic or medical causes.\n5. Encourage social connection and support, possibly involving family or support groups.\n6. Schedule follow-up to assess response to treatment and adjust plans accordingly.",
