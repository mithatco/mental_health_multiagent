This tool helps us get a broad overview of different mental health symptoms you might be experiencing over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to be open. We will go through 23 questions together, covering various areas like mood, anxiety, psychosis, and more. There are no right or wrong answers \u2014 I just want to understand how you've been feeling and what you've been experiencing. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You've been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoiding situations that heighten your anxiety. You also mentioned hearing <sym>voices</sym> and believing others can hear your thoughts, which suggests <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>. Your sleep has been disturbed, with difficulty falling asleep and feeling restless, and you've noted some substance use as a way to cope with these feelings. These symptoms collectively indicate a complex mental health picture that requires careful evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, with comorbid major depressive disorder and anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing <quote>voices that comment and argue</quote>), <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym> (thinking <quote>others can hear my thoughts</quote>), and experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym> (feeling <quote>like I'm watching myself from outside</quote>) are indicative of <med>psychotic features</med>.

The anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym> as a coping mechanism may influence the severity and course of these symptoms. Given the constellation of psychotic, mood, and anxiety symptoms, the most fitting diagnosis appears to be a <med>schizophrenia spectrum disorder</med> with comorbid mood and anxiety features. However, ongoing assessment is necessary to clarify the primary disorder and rule out other conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history, mental status exam, and collateral information if possible.\n2. Initiate a safety assessment, particularly regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with immediate intervention if needed.\n3. Consider pharmacological treatment, such as antipsychotic medications for <med>psychotic symptoms</med> and antidepressants for <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n4. Refer for psychotherapy focused on symptom management, coping skills, and addressing <sym>substance use</sym>.\n5. Develop a safety plan to manage <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and monitor for worsening symptoms.\n6. Provide psychoeducation on <med>psychosis</med> and <med>mood disorders</med> to help understand symptoms and treatment options.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor response to treatment and adjust as necessary.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and significant sleep disturbance characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of excessive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and social withdrawal. Psychotic phenomena are evidenced by auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), paranoid ideation (belief others can hear thoughts, broadcasted thoughts), and disorganized thoughts, along with feelings of dissociation (depersonalization/derealization). The patient also describes recurrent distressing intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like mental routines, suggestive of obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nNotably, the patient endorses self-harm ideation, substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication with prescribed medications in excess), and somatic complaints (headaches, unexplained pains). There are concerns about perceived invalidation of health concerns and feelings of disconnection from self and others, pointing toward a possible underlying dissociative or identity disturbance component.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of mood symptoms (depression, anhedonia), anxiety, and psychotic features.\n- Evidence of dissociative experiences (depersonalization/derealization).\n- Substance use as a potential maladaptive coping mechanism.\n- Sleep and concentration difficulties.\n- Risk factors include suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, and substance misuse.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal thoughts and self-harm ideation.\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions.\n- Substance use attempting to manage distress.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.\n- Recent use of medications without medical oversight.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex psychiatric profile characterized by depressive and anxious symptomatology, psychotic features (auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation), dissociative experiences, and substance misuse. The presence of suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts warrants immediate clinical attention. The symptom constellation suggests potential primary mood or psychotic disorder with dissociative features, or a possible psychotic spectrum disorder compounded by mood and anxiety comorbidities. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment, including risk evaluation and collateral information, is recommended to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

Although it also notes mood and anxiety symptoms, the primary emphasis on psychotic features aligns closely with the expected profile of schizophrenia.

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of challenging experiences over the past two weeks that deeply affect your daily life. You described persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You've been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoiding situations that heighten your anxiety. You also mentioned hearing <sym>voices</sym> and believing others can hear your thoughts, which suggests <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>. Your sleep has been disturbed, with difficulty falling asleep and feeling restless, and you've noted some substance use as a way to cope with these feelings. These symptoms collectively indicate a complex mental health picture that requires careful evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, with comorbid major depressive disorder and anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing <quote>voices that comment and argue</quote>), <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym> (thinking <quote>others can hear my thoughts</quote>), and experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym> (feeling <quote>like I'm watching myself from outside</quote>) are indicative of <med>psychotic features</med>. The persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <quote>feeling stuck, hopeless, and losing interest</quote>, along with sleep disturbance and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, suggest a significant <med>major depressive episode</med>. The anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym> as a coping mechanism may influence the severity and course of these symptoms. Given the constellation of psychotic, mood, and anxiety symptoms, the most fitting diagnosis appears to be a <med>schizophrenia spectrum disorder</med> with comorbid mood and anxiety features. However, ongoing assessment is necessary to clarify the primary disorder and rule out other conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history, mental status exam, and collateral information if possible.\n2. Initiate a safety assessment, particularly regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with immediate intervention if needed.\n3. Consider pharmacological treatment, such as antipsychotic medications for <med>psychotic symptoms</med> and antidepressants for <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n4. Refer for psychotherapy focused on symptom management, coping skills, and addressing <sym>substance use</sym>.\n5. Develop a safety plan to manage <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and monitor for worsening symptoms.\n6. Provide psychoeducation on <med>psychosis</med> and <med>mood disorders</med> to help understand symptoms and treatment options.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor response to treatment and adjust as necessary.",
