This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on social anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address anxiety and depression.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal ideation, and establish safety planning if needed.  \n6.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with prominent symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, evidenced by significant fear and avoidance of social situations, anticipatory anxiety, and distress related to social judgment. They report pervasive feelings of dysphoria, including anhedonia, low mood, and hopelessness, which may suggest comorbid depressive features. The patient also experiences heightened irritability, emotional reactivity, and somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension, which may be related to underlying anxiety or stress.\n\nPattern analysis reveals persistent worry, especially regarding social interactions, with associated sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating sleep due to racing thoughts. There is evidence of recurrent intrusive negative thoughts about social failures, contributing to social withdrawal and feelings of isolation. While no evidence of psychotic symptoms or self-harm behaviors is noted, the patient reports panic-like symptoms in social contexts and avoidance behaviors, signifying significant functional impairment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical concern include social anxiety disorder, comorbid depression, and heightened physiological arousal. The patient's avoidant behaviors, mood symptoms, and anxiety-related somatic complaints are clinically relevant and warrant further assessment for potential mood disorder and anxiety spectrum conditions.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs are limited but include social avoidance and emotional distress that could impact daily functioning. No current indications of suicidality or self-harm are identified, though the patient's feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal should be monitored over time.\n\nIn summary, this individual exhibits significant social phobia, depressive symptoms, and anxiety features with associated sleep and concentration difficulties. These symptoms suggest a need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and targeted intervention to address social anxiety and comorbid mood disturbances, along with ongoing risk assessment for worsening emotional or behavioral health.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The conversation covers many of the DSM-5 Level 1 domains, including mood, anxiety, psychosis, sleep, repetitive thoughts, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. However, it neglects several key areas such as mania, anger, and detailed assessment of somatic symptoms and memory issues. Not all questions were explored in depth, and some domains were only superficially addressed or omitted entirely, leading to only moderate coverage overall.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions asked are generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria and appropriately target clinical symptoms. The phrasing is clear and relevant, and the therapist maintains professional language. Nonetheless, some questions could be more precise\u2014for example, clarifying the intensity or frequency of symptoms\u2014and some follow-up probes are lacking, which slightly diminishes clinical relevance.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically for the most part, with questions following naturally from previous responses. However, there are occasional minor lapses\u2014for instance, the transition from anxiety to somatic concerns feels somewhat abrupt, and the therapist does not always follow up on symptoms like physical tension or intrusive thoughts in sufficient depth. Overall, the conversation maintains coherence but could benefit from smoother transitions and deeper exploration of key areas.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder with features of Major Depressive Disorder and generalized anxiety is generally supported by patient reports of social avoidance, low mood, intrusive thoughts, and physical symptoms. However, the justification lacks detailed linkage to specific DSM-5 criteria, such as explicit symptom duration, impairment level, or ruling out other diagnoses like panic disorder or specific phobias. The reasoning is somewhat superficial and could be more explicit and comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrates a professional tone, explains the purpose of the assessment clearly, and provides a supportive environment. There are empathetic comments, and the therapist validates the patient's experiences. Nonetheless, some responses could be more personalized or affirming\u2014such as explicitly acknowledging the patient's distress or feelings of isolation\u2014to enhance warmth and connection. Overall, the tone remains professional and caring but leaves room for more warmth."
      },
      "overall_comments": "This conversation exhibits solid clinical coverage and professionalism but falls short of comprehensive DSM-5 domain coverage and in-depth diagnostic justification. The flow is generally coherent, yet deeper follow-up on key symptoms and clearer linkage to DSM-5 criteria would strengthen the assessment. Empathy is present but could be more explicitly expressed to foster rapport. Overall, the session is competent but not exceptional; it would benefit from more thorough exploration, nuanced questioning, and explicit diagnostic reasoning to achieve a higher rating.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience a persistent sense of <sym>dysphoria</sym>, including <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You frequently feel <sym>anxious</sym>, particularly in social situations, and this often leads to <sym>avoidance</sym> of social gatherings, which contributes to feelings of <sym>isolation</sym>. You also notice <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> about past social failures that make it harder for you to connect with others. Physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym> accompany your emotional distress, and your sleep is affected by racing thoughts, making it difficult to fall asleep. Despite these challenges, you have not engaged in thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychosis</sym>, but your overall functioning and well-being are impacted by these symptoms. Your experiences reflect significant emotional and social difficulties that are understandable and deserve attention and compassionate care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (recurrent depressive episodes) and associated <med>generalized anxiety symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of intense fear and avoidance of social situations, along with physical symptoms like heart racing and panic-like sensations, align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The pervasive low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbances, and physical tension further support an underlying <med>generalized anxiety component</med>. The symptoms are persistent, causing significant distress and impairment, which fits the criteria for these diagnoses. While somatic complaints are present, they appear to be secondary to anxiety and mood symptoms rather than indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> alone.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychological assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on social anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address anxiety and depression.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal ideation, and establish safety planning if needed.  \n6. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and a psychologist or therapist experienced in anxiety and mood disorders.",
