Sleep disturbances are prominent, with reports of insomnia, difficulty maintaining sleep, and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). There are also cognitive concerns, including recent memory impairments and disorientation (Q16), alongside perceptual disturbances such as auditory hallucinations (Q13) and thought broadcasting (Q14), indicating potential psychotic features.\n\nThe patient endorses intrusive and recurrent distressing thoughts (Q17), compulsive behaviors (Q18), and dissociative symptoms (Q19, Q20), pointing to possible obsessive-compulsive and dissociative symptomatology. Feelings of social withdrawal and emotional disconnection are noted (Q21), further indicating social and relational impairment.\n\nRisk factors include reported self-harm ideation (Q12), substance use with alcohol (Q22), tobacco (Q23), and non-prescribed medication use (Q24), all of which increase clinical concern for self-harm and substance misuse. Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and gastrointestinal aches (Q10) may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring mood, anxiety, psychotic features, and substance use, with notable dissociative experiences and cognitive decline. The patient\u2019s high distress levels, self-harm thoughts, substance misuse, and hallucinations warrant urgent comprehensive assessment for possible mood and psychotic disorders, as well as evaluation of risk for self-harm.\n\nIn summary, this individual presents with significant affective, psychotic, dissociative, and substance use symptoms, compounded by sleep and cognitive disturbances, and associated with elevated risk factors for self-injury. A multidisciplinary assessment and immediate safety planning are recommended.",
