This questionnaire is designed to help us understand different areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms you might be experiencing. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various mental health domains. We will go through each question one by one, and I'd like you to answer honestly and in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

There is also evidence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, which are concerning. You reported feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from your relationships and a sense of being lost about your future, all of which point to significant emotional and psychological distress. Your experiences suggest a multifaceted mental health picture that warrants careful evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, and features of Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The chronic worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and panic attacks support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The avoidance behaviors and fear of panic attacks indicate significant <med>agoraphobia</med> components. The experiences of <sym>derealization</sym>, <sym>depersonalization</sym>, and feelings of being outside oneself suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The somatic complaints and reports of feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers could be manifestations of somatic expression of psychological distress but do not meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> in this context. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants urgent attention. Overall, the symptoms span mood, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic domains, indicating a complex presentation with multiple comorbidities.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess suicide risk, and determine severity.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and establish crisis resources.  \n3. Consider evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, and trauma-focused therapy if dissociative symptoms are prominent.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, to manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n5. Monitor somatic complaints and consider collaboration with medical providers to rule out physical causes and address somatic manifestations of distress.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider support groups for mood and anxiety disorders.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with pervasive symptoms indicative of mood, anxiety, and trauma-related concerns. Key features include persistent anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, and reports of emotional numbness and disconnection. The patient reports heightened irritability, sleep disturbance characterized by reduced sleep duration coupled with fatigue and restlessness, and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and disorientation. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including chronic feelings of being on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors due to fear of panic episodes. Somatic complaints of unexplained headaches and stomachaches suggest somatic manifestations of psychological distress. The patient also reports intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of emotional detachment, derealization, and depersonalization, alongside a sense of identity confusion and social withdrawal. Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation when overwhelmed, though no active plans are disclosed. Substance use appears minimal, limited to occasional alcohol consumption in stressful contexts, with no tobacco or misuse of medications reported. No auditory or visual hallucinations are noted.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a combination of affective dysregulation, anxiety, dissociative experiences, and somatic complaints, consistent with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, potentially with features of trauma-related dissociation. The presence of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors suggests significant impairment and danger related to panic and anxiety. The patient's social withdrawal and loss of self-identity further underscore the severity of distress.\n\nClinically, these responses warrant thorough assessment for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative symptoms. The active suicidal ideation, coupled with feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness, indicate a potential risk for self-harm that necessitates immediate safety planning. The somatic complaints and history of feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers should be explored further for somatic symptom disorder or somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Overall, the presentation reflects significant psychological suffering with multiple domains requiring integrated intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing experience characterized by persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy, and ongoing <sym>depression</sym>. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> more easily and experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as reduced sleep and restlessness, which contribute to your fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Anxiety is a significant part of your experience, with frequent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations due to fear of panic. You mentioned somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. There is also evidence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, which are concerning. You reported feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from your relationships and a sense of being lost about your future, all of which point to significant emotional and psychological distress. Your experiences suggest a multifaceted mental health picture that warrants careful evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, and features of Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The chronic worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and panic attacks support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The avoidance behaviors and fear of panic attacks indicate significant <med>agoraphobia</med> components. The experiences of <sym>derealization</sym>, <sym>depersonalization</sym>, and feelings of being outside oneself suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The somatic complaints and reports of feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers could be manifestations of somatic expression of psychological distress but do not meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> in this context. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants urgent attention. Overall, the symptoms span mood, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic domains, indicating a complex presentation with multiple comorbidities.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess suicide risk, and determine severity.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and establish crisis resources.  \n3. Consider evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, and trauma-focused therapy if dissociative symptoms are prominent.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, to manage mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n5. Monitor somatic complaints and consider collaboration with medical providers to rule out physical causes and address somatic manifestations of distress.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider support groups for mood and anxiety disorders.",
