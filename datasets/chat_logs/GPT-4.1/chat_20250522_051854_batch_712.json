You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety, especially around social interactions</sym>, which you tend to avoid because of worries about embarrassing yourself. Sleep has been inconsistent, sometimes staying awake for hours or sleeping too much, leaving you feeling tired. You experience <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym> about social fears and past embarrassments, and occasionally have <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about hurting yourself, although not with intent or planning. While you do not experience hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, you do notice occasional forgetfulness and feelings of detachment, but these are transient.

The significant avoidance of social situations, heightened anxiety around social interactions, and anticipatory worry suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.

Although there are no indications of psychosis or substance misuse, the emotional distress and functional impairments point toward these diagnoses. The presence of social avoidance and anxiety features warrants considering the comorbid social anxiety. The transient cognitive issues are noted but do not currently meet criteria for a neurocognitive disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible conditions, such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments including <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depression and social anxiety, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or, if appropriate, medication.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in thoughts of self-harm and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce avoidance and build social confidence.",

Additionally, the patient exhibits significant social avoidance behaviors, particularly related to fears of embarrassment, and experiences anticipatory anxiety in social contexts, suggestive of social anxiety disorder components. \n\nThe patient acknowledges frequent anxiety, especially pre-social interactions, with occasional feelings of panic when anticipating social situations. Sleep disturbances are noted, characterized by inconsistent sleep patterns, which may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive concerns include occasional forgetfulness and moments of disorientation, though these are described as transient. The patient also reports persistent ruminative thoughts, especially about social fears and embarrassing moments, which may contribute to their social withdrawal and emotional distress.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive ideation of self-harm, described as \"dark thoughts,\" particularly when overwhelmed. No evidence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or current suicidal intent is evident, although the presence of distressing ruminations warrants ongoing assessment.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation is marked by moderate depressive symptoms, social anxiety features, sleep dysregulation, and ruminative thought patterns, with some risk factors for emotional distress. These clinical features warrant comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention to address mood, anxiety, and social functioning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and thoughts over the past couple of weeks. You've described feeling <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> that you used to enjoy, along with persistent <sym>feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless</sym>. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety, especially around social interactions</sym>, which you tend to avoid because of worries about embarrassing yourself. Sleep has been inconsistent, sometimes staying awake for hours or sleeping too much, leaving you feeling tired. You experience <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym> about social fears and past embarrassments, and occasionally have <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about hurting yourself, although not with intent or planning. While you do not experience hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, you do notice occasional forgetfulness and feelings of detachment, but these are transient. Overall, you seem to be struggling with mood disturbances, social anxiety, sleep issues, and ruminative thoughts, all contributing to your sense of isolation and distress. Your openness about these experiences is important and a positive step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Social Anxiety Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The significant avoidance of social situations, heightened anxiety around social interactions, and anticipatory worry suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, rumination, and passive <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> further support the depression diagnosis. Although there are no indications of psychosis or substance misuse, the emotional distress and functional impairments point toward these diagnoses. The presence of social avoidance and anxiety features warrants considering the comorbid social anxiety. The transient cognitive issues are noted but do not currently meet criteria for a neurocognitive disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible conditions, such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related disorders.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments including <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depression and social anxiety, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or, if appropriate, medication.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in thoughts of self-harm and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce avoidance and build social confidence.",
