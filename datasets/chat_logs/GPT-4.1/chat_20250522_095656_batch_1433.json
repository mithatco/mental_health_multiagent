I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering mood, anxiety, sleep, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one step by step. Are you ready for me to begin?"

Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of hypersomnia and difficulty maintaining sleep quality. The patient exhibits heightened anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry, racing thoughts, and avoidance behaviors related to anxious stimuli. Physical complaints include headaches and stomachaches, which the patient attributes to stress. Cognitive concerns include recent forgetfulness and concentration difficulties, along with episodic feelings of depersonalization or derealization. \n\nAdditionally, the patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without active intent but expresses distress related to intrusive, upsetting thoughts. There is a notable withdrawal from social interactions and diminished emotional connectivity with others. No evidence of psychotic phenomena, substance misuse, or risk-taking behaviors is reported. \n\nPattern analysis indicates co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms with somatic complaints, cognitive disturbances, and social withdrawal. The presence of hopelessness, passive suicidal thoughts, and significant functional impairment warrants careful risk assessment.\n\nClinical Significance:\n- Major depressive symptoms with possible comorbid anxiety disorder.\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue suggest affective disorder impact.\n- Cognitive and dissociative symptoms may indicate heightened psychological distress.\n- Passive suicidal ideation necessitates ongoing safety evaluation.\n- Social withdrawal and emotional detachment reflect potential depressive features impacting social functioning.\n\nRisk Factors/Warning Signs:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts.\n- Significant social withdrawal.\n- Cognitive and dissociative symptoms indicating severe distress.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a constellation of depressive and anxious symptoms, accompanied by somatic complaints and social withdrawal, requiring comprehensive assessment and monitoring for suicidality and functional impairment.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes experiencing persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>little enjoyment in activities</quote> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> that have been ongoing over the past two weeks. They report <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by hypersomnia and difficulty maintaining sleep, and feelings of <sym>overwhelm</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>persistent worry</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and engaging in <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to their anxiety. Physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are present, alongside cognitive issues such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>. They mention <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without intent, and a sense of <sym>detachment</sym> from themselves and others, including <sym>withdrawal from social relationships</sym>. Overall, these symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns, with significant impact on functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder (unspecified)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over a two-week period meets criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym>, suggests a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints further support a depressive and anxiety spectrum diagnosis. The <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful monitoring but does not indicate active intent at this stage. The dissociative symptoms and social withdrawal reflect profound distress impacting daily functioning. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse points towards mood and anxiety pathology rather than other primary disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation to rule out other possible diagnoses and assess risk, including suicidality.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, challenge negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety.  \n4. Monitor symptoms closely, especially suicidal thoughts, and provide safety planning as needed.  \n5. Evaluate and address sleep issues, possibly involving sleep hygiene education or referral to a sleep specialist if warranted.",
