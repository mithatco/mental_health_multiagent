This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to gather information to better support your care, and everything you share here is kept confidential. I'll be asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as you can. If you're ready, we can begin with the first question."

      "content": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health experiences. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been navigating significant mood swings, including episodes of <sym>depression</sym> characterized by feelings of numbness, hopelessness, and difficulty finding joy in activities you once enjoyed. At times, you also experience <sym>elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>, which seem to occur during hypomanic or manic phases. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling irritable, anxious, and sometimes disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, along with physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches that you associate with stress. Your worries about not being understood and occasional thoughts of <sym>death or wishing to disappear</sym> highlight the emotional distress you\u2019re experiencing. Additionally, your use of substances such as alcohol and cigarettes appears to be a way of coping with these mood states, and you\u2019ve acknowledged some difficulty with concentration and intrusive thoughts. Overall, your experiences suggest a pattern of significant mood instability intertwined with anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints, which warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms and episodic substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, combined with <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as decreased sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and dissociative experiences further support a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features. The episodic nature of mood swings, with clear periods of low and elevated mood, distinguishes this from other disorders such as <med>major depressive disorder</med> or <med>cyclothymic disorder</med>. The substance use appears to be an attempt at self-medication rather than primary, but it complicates the clinical picture and should be addressed in treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms, including risk assessment for suicidality.\n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, potentially including mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) and medications targeting anxiety symptoms.\n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Bipolar disorder</med> and develop a personalized treatment plan, including psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy.\n4. Address substance use behaviors through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized substance use treatment programs.\n5. Offer support for managing anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences, possibly including mindfulness-based interventions.\n6. Establish a safety plan, especially considering the passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and emotional distress.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor mood stability, medication adherence, and overall functioning.",

During hypomanic or manic episodes, they describe decreased need for sleep (as little as 3-4 hours), elevated energy, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity (e.g., risky spending, initiating multiple projects), and heightened confidence. The patient also endorses irritability, mood swings, and disinhibition, consistent with bipolar spectrum features.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of generalized worry, racing thoughts, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors in social and crowded settings. Somatic complaints include episodic headaches and musculoskeletal aches, which they perceive as stress-related. There are experiences of dissociative phenomena (feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings) and occasional intrusive negative thoughts.\n\nSubstance use behaviors are notable, with regular cigarette smoking and episodic alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, often linked to mood states. The patient admits to prior use of painkillers and recreational drugs, suggesting potential maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes, impulsivity during hypomanic phases, substance use for mood regulation, and social withdrawal. The patient's acknowledgment of feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers and experiencing emotional distress underscores the need for comprehensive assessment.\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation suggests bipolar disorder, with concurrent depressive and hypomanic/manic features, alongside comorbid anxiety and substance use issues. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful risk assessment and monitoring.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health experiences. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been navigating significant mood swings, including episodes of <sym>depression</sym> characterized by feelings of numbness, hopelessness, and difficulty finding joy in activities you once enjoyed. At times, you also experience <sym>elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>, which seem to occur during hypomanic or manic phases. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling irritable, anxious, and sometimes disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, along with physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches that you associate with stress. Your worries about not being understood and occasional thoughts of <sym>death or wishing to disappear</sym> highlight the emotional distress you\u2019re experiencing. Additionally, your use of substances such as alcohol and cigarettes appears to be a way of coping with these mood states, and you\u2019ve acknowledged some difficulty with concentration and intrusive thoughts. Overall, your experiences suggest a pattern of significant mood instability intertwined with anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints, which warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms and episodic substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, combined with <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as decreased sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and dissociative experiences further support a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features. The episodic nature of mood swings, with clear periods of low and elevated mood, distinguishes this from other disorders such as <med>major depressive disorder</med> or <med>cyclothymic disorder</med>. The substance use appears to be an attempt at self-medication rather than primary, but it complicates the clinical picture and should be addressed in treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms, including risk assessment for suicidality.\n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, potentially including mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) and medications targeting anxiety symptoms.\n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Bipolar disorder</med> and develop a personalized treatment plan, including psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy.\n4. Address substance use behaviors through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized substance use treatment programs.\n5. Offer support for managing anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences, possibly including mindfulness-based interventions.\n6. Establish a safety plan, especially considering the passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and emotional distress.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor mood stability, medication adherence, and overall functioning.",
