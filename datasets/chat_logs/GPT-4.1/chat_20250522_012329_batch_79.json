Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to screen for various mental health symptoms across different domains, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Your responses are confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share honestly. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one carefully. There's no need to rush, and please feel free to share as much detail as you're comfortable with. Are you ready to begin?"

The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, worry, social avoidance, and panic episodes</sym> indicates comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely social anxiety disorder given the specific social fears described.

Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess risk, and explore treatment options.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address depression and anxiety symptoms, along with possible pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) if appropriate.  \n3.

There is evidence of cognitive and attentional difficulties, such as increased forgetfulness and disorientation, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by fragmentation and non-restorative sleep. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including pervasive worry, social anxiety leading to avoidance behaviors, and episodic panic attacks, particularly in social contexts. The patient reports transient intrusive thoughts, particularly related to social embarrassment, and experiences episodes of dissociation or depersonalization. Additionally, there are indications of emotional numbing and social withdrawal, with decreased interest in interpersonal relationships.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal concurrent depressive and anxiety symptomatology, with some features suggestive of social anxiety disorder and panic phenomena. The presence of passive suicidal ideation, albeit without intent or plan, warrants clinical attention. No evidence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors is reported.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive episodes with comorbid social anxiety, dissociative experiences, and passive suicidal thoughts. Risk factors include social withdrawal, hopelessness, and transient suicidal ideation, which necessitate careful monitoring. The patient's sleep disruption and cognitive concerns also suggest functional impairment.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with moderate to severe depressive symptoms compounded by social anxiety and dissociative features, with passive suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and potential intervention targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and social functioning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of significant symptoms that suggest you are experiencing considerable emotional distress. You described feelings of <sym>persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and a sense of hopelessness about the future</sym>. You've also mentioned increased <sym>irritability, forgetfulness, and sleep disturbances, including waking frequently during the night and feeling unrefreshed</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a prominent aspect of your experience, especially with <sym>constant worry, social anxiety leading to avoidance, and episodes of panic in social situations</sym>. Additionally, you've disclosed <sym>intrusive thoughts related to social embarrassment, feelings of dissociation or depersonalization, and occasional passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. These symptoms seem to be impacting your daily functioning and overall well-being, and I want you to know that your honesty is very important and helpful in understanding what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Distress and Dissociative Features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep disruption</sym> over the past two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, worry, social avoidance, and panic episodes</sym> indicates comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely social anxiety disorder given the specific social fears described. The episodes of <sym>dissociation or depersonalization</sym> suggest features of dissociative experiences, which can occur with severe anxiety or depression. The passive <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> warrant careful clinical monitoring but do not indicate active suicidal intent at this time. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors supports this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess risk, and explore treatment options.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address depression and anxiety symptoms, along with possible pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) if appropriate.  \n3. Develop a safety plan and provide support regarding <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, including crisis resources and regular follow-up.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if needed, medication management.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and social anxiety to tailor interventions effectively.",
