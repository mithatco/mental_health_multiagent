Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a brief questionnaire designed to understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences honestly. We will go through 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. There are no right or wrong answers; I just want to understand what you've been going through. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment regarding suicidal thoughts and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or optimize evidence-based treatment for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants).  \n3. Address comorbid <med>Anxiety symptoms</med> with appropriate interventions, which may include therapy and/or medication.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Encourage social engagement and support networks to reduce social withdrawal.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response, symptom progression, and safety, especially considering passive suicidal thoughts.",

There is evidence of significant mood disturbance, with reports of feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, and experiencing intrusive negative thoughts. Anxiety symptoms are also notable, characterized by chronic worry, irritability, avoidance behaviors, and occasional panic-like sensations, indicating comorbid anxiety features.\n\nSleep disturbances are evident, involving both insomnia and hypersomnia, contributing to ongoing fatigue and concentration difficulties. Cognitive concerns include impaired memory and concentration, with reported forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient reports recurrent distressing intrusive thoughts and feelings of emotional numbness or detachment, although dissociative symptoms appear absent.\n\nThe patient admits to experiencing some passive suicidal thoughts without active plans or intent, which warrants clinical attention given the depth of despair expressed. Substance use appears limited to occasional smoking and light alcohol consumption, with no recent misuse or non-prescribed medication use reported.\n\nPatterns of social withdrawal, anhedonia, and mood symptoms, combined with anxiety features and sleep disruptions, suggest a complex presentation consistent with moderate to severe depression with comorbid anxiety symptoms. The presence of passive suicidal ideation indicates a need for safety assessment and ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs include:**\n- Persistent depressed mood and anhedonia\n- Feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness\n- Passive suicidal thoughts\n- Social withdrawal and emotional numbing\n- Sleep disturbances and concentration impairments\n\nFurther clinical evaluation should focus on assessing the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, safety planning regarding suicidal ideation, and exploring potential underlying etiologies contributing to the current presentation.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes a persistent <sym>low interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, along with a <sym>prolonged feeling of sadness and hopelessness</sym>. They report <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>, with both insomnia and oversleeping, and experience <sym>concentration problems</sym> and <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. The patient also shares feelings of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>being overwhelmed</sym>, along with <sym>chronic worry and anxiety</sym>. They have noticed <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and a sense of <sym>emotional numbness or detachment</sym>. They acknowledge <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without intent or plans, which indicates a significant level of distress. Overall, the patient appears to be experiencing a complex mixture of <med>depressive symptoms</med> with notable <med>anxiety features</med> and sleep disturbances, impacting their daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry, irritability, avoidance behaviors, and occasional panic-like feelings</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, which are common in depressive presentations. The reported <sym>sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, and passive suicidal thoughts</sym> further support a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression with anxious features. While there are some somatic complaints like <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym>, these are likely related to the overall mood and anxiety symptoms rather than a primary somatic disorder. The passive suicidal thoughts warrant careful safety assessment but do not indicate active intent at this time. Overall, the clinical picture suggests a mood disorder with significant anxiety components, affecting the patient's functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment regarding suicidal thoughts and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or optimize evidence-based treatment for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants).  \n3. Address comorbid <med>Anxiety symptoms</med> with appropriate interventions, which may include therapy and/or medication.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Encourage social engagement and support networks to reduce social withdrawal.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response, symptom progression, and safety, especially considering passive suicidal thoughts.",
