Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity and duration of symptoms, including screening for trauma history.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for depression and anxiety disorders.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, further evaluation by a sleep specialist.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or worsening dissociative experiences, and ensure safety planning if needed.  \n6. Explore the possibility of trauma-focused therapies if trauma-related symptoms or dissociation are prominent in subsequent assessments.",

There are also prominent anxiety symptoms, notably social anxiety (A7, A9), panic-like episodes (A8), and generalized worry (A7), alongside behavioral avoidance patterns. Intrusive thoughts (A17), compulsive checking behaviors (A18), and dissociative experiences (A19) further complicate the clinical picture, suggesting comorbid anxiety and possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The patient's affective symptoms are compounded by somatic complaints (A10), which may reflect psychosomatic manifestations.\n\nPattern analysis reveals significant social withdrawal, emotional dysregulation, and heightened anxiety states, with concurrent mood symptoms. The patient reports no current suicidal ideation (A12) or psychotic symptoms (A13, A14), but exhibits risk factors related to functional impairment, including impaired sleep, cognitive difficulties, and social avoidance. The presence of dissociative phenomena warrants careful assessment for dissociative disorders or trauma-related pathology.\n\nOverall, these findings highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to delineate the interplay between mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, and to inform targeted intervention strategies.",

You also experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially related to social situations, which leads to <quote>avoidance of social gatherings</quote> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep difficulties, memory concerns, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of dissociation further complicate your emotional landscape, contributing to a sense of disconnection and confusion about your identity and relationships. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms create a heavy burden, and your openness in sharing them is an important step toward understanding and addressing what you're experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and features of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>social anxiety</sym>, characterized by intense worry and avoidance of social situations, suggests comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Episodes of <sym>panic-like feelings</sym>, especially in social or unfamiliar settings, indicate possible <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts and checking behaviors point toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The dissociative feelings of detachment, as well as concerns about memory and identity, also warrant consideration of trauma-related or dissociative features, but current data primarily support mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses. The absence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation narrows the focus to these disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity and duration of symptoms, including screening for trauma history.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for depression and anxiety disorders.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, further evaluation by a sleep specialist.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including suicidal thoughts or worsening dissociative experiences, and ensure safety planning if needed.  \n6. Explore the possibility of trauma-focused therapies if trauma-related symptoms or dissociation are prominent in subsequent assessments.",
