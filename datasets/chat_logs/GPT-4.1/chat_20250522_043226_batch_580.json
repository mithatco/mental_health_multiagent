I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to help us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to gather information to better support you, and everything you share here is confidential. This assessment includes 23 questions across various domains like mood, anxiety, and others. We'll go through each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. If you're ready, I'd like to start with the first question."

You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about having panic attacks, which leads you to avoid crowded places and public settings. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym>, chest, and stomach pains seem to be connected to your anxiety, and you've had difficulty sleeping with racing thoughts. You sometimes feel disconnected or in a fog, particularly during panic episodes, and your social interactions have diminished as you withdraw from loved ones. While you experience some intrusive negative thoughts and flashes of worst-case scenarios, you do not hear voices or experience paranoid beliefs. Your overall presentation suggests a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms with physical and cognitive impacts, which require careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features, and panic disorder features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>excessive worry</sym>, physical symptoms, and avoidance behaviors are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> with sudden intense fear, physical symptoms such as chest pain and racing thoughts, as well as avoidance of situations that trigger these attacks, support a diagnosis of <med>panic disorder</med>. The presence of dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts further complicate the clinical picture but do not point to psychosis. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors suggests these diagnoses are the most fitting based on current symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on suicidal ideation given expressions of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of pharmacological options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.  \n3. Develop a safety plan addressing avoidance behaviors and panic triggers, including gradual exposure strategies and relaxation techniques.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider behavioral interventions or medication to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Educate the patient about the nature of anxiety and depression, including the role of physical symptoms, and explore social support systems to reduce social withdrawal.",

They report significant worry related to panic attacks, with recurrent panic episodes, avoidance behaviors of public and crowded spaces, and physical symptoms such as headaches, chest, and abdominal pains suggestive of somatic manifestations of anxiety. Sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with racing thoughts, are evident. Cognitive symptoms include occasional forgetfulness and disorientation during heightened anxiety states, as well as intrusive negative thoughts and images. Dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected or in a fog, are noted during panic episodes. Social withdrawal and decreased enjoyment of relationships indicate social impairment. The patient denies psychotic symptoms or substance misuse, and reports no current engagement in compulsive behaviors beyond safety checks, which are linked to anxiety.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Consistent presentation of mood and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks.\n- Physical symptoms and sleep issues are intertwined with anxiety and mood disturbances.\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociative experiences reinforce the severity of anxiety.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia suggest depressive features.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Expressions of hopelessness and dark thoughts raise concern for suicidal ideation, warranting further assessment.\n- Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors increase risk for functional impairment and potential safety concerns.\n- No current indications of psychosis or substance abuse.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, notably panic disorder features, somatic complaints, sleep disruption, intrusive thoughts, and social withdrawal. The symptomatic profile warrants comprehensive evaluation of suicidal risk, severity of disorder, and development of an integrated treatment plan targeting mood, anxiety, and safety concerns.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that significantly affect your daily life. You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about having panic attacks, which leads you to avoid crowded places and public settings. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym>, chest, and stomach pains seem to be connected to your anxiety, and you've had difficulty sleeping with racing thoughts. You sometimes feel disconnected or in a fog, particularly during panic episodes, and your social interactions have diminished as you withdraw from loved ones. While you experience some intrusive negative thoughts and flashes of worst-case scenarios, you do not hear voices or experience paranoid beliefs. Your overall presentation suggests a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms with physical and cognitive impacts, which require careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features, and panic disorder features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>excessive worry</sym>, physical symptoms, and avoidance behaviors are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> with sudden intense fear, physical symptoms such as chest pain and racing thoughts, as well as avoidance of situations that trigger these attacks, support a diagnosis of <med>panic disorder</med>. The presence of dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts further complicate the clinical picture but do not point to psychosis. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors suggests these diagnoses are the most fitting based on current symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on suicidal ideation given expressions of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of pharmacological options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.  \n3. Develop a safety plan addressing avoidance behaviors and panic triggers, including gradual exposure strategies and relaxation techniques.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider behavioral interventions or medication to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Educate the patient about the nature of anxiety and depression, including the role of physical symptoms, and explore social support systems to reduce social withdrawal.",
