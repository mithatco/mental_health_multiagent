It sounds like you've been experiencing a wide range of challenging symptoms, including periods of low interest, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability\u2014common signs of depression. At the same time, you've described episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and starting new projects, which suggest episodes of elevated mood or hypomania. You've also mentioned feelings of anxiety, physical tension, and avoidance behaviors, along with some cognitive disturbances like forgetfulness and feelings of detachment, especially during depressive phases. While you have occasional thoughts of self-harm, you do not seem to have active plans at this time. Your experiences indicate significant mood instability and associated symptoms that impact your functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of alternating episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional withdrawal, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, decreased sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, is characteristic of <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The hypomanic episodes are evident from symptoms such as decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, and impulsivity, while the depressive episodes align with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and cognitive disturbances. Anxiety symptoms, including worry, physical tension, and avoidance, are also present, potentially complicating the clinical picture. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature support this diagnosis. The patient's thoughts of self-harm, without active intent, merit careful monitoring but do not currently suggest active suicidal behavior.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including detailed mood history and assessment of episode severity and duration.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (such as lithium or lamotrigine) and targeted psychotherapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation and anxiety management.  \n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and provide safety planning if necessary.  \n4. Address comorbid anxiety symptoms with appropriate interventions, which might include relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or medication if indicated.  \n5. Consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management and a therapist for ongoing support to stabilize mood swings and reduce distress.",

Core symptoms include anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and pervasive low mood over the past two weeks. Concurrently, the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with hypomanic or manic episodes, such as decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity (e.g., impulsive purchases), and elevated energy levels. Anxiety symptoms are also evident, with reports of heightened worry, physical tension, and avoidance behaviors. Cognitive concerns include memory difficulties and feelings of disconnection or derealization, particularly during depressive periods. The patient acknowledges occasional suicidal ideation without concrete plans but denies current intent or active self-harm behaviors.\n\nPatterns observed suggest mood instability with alternating depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes, alongside anxiety features and cognitive disturbances. There is a pattern of behavioral disinhibition during high-energy phases and social withdrawal during depressive states.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Mood disorder with bipolar features, evidenced by episodic depression and hypomanic symptoms\n- Anxiety symptoms, including generalized anxiety and panic episodes\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances (derealization)\n- Suicidal ideation without active plans\n- Substance use risk factors associated with episodic risky behaviors and alcohol consumption\n\nRisk factors/warning signs include recent suicidal thoughts, impulsivity (e.g., unbudgeted purchases, risky behaviors), and mood instability. While no current active self-harm or psychotic symptoms are reported, ongoing mood dysregulation and anxiety warrant close monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a history suggestive of bipolar spectrum disorder, characterized by episodic mood swings, anxiety, cognitive disturbances, and some behavioral disinhibition. Further assessment is recommended to clarify diagnosis, evaluate the severity and impact of symptoms, and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health over the past two weeks, and I appreciate your openness. It sounds like you've been experiencing a wide range of challenging symptoms, including periods of low interest, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability\u2014common signs of depression. At the same time, you've described episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and starting new projects, which suggest episodes of elevated mood or hypomania. You've also mentioned feelings of anxiety, physical tension, and avoidance behaviors, along with some cognitive disturbances like forgetfulness and feelings of detachment, especially during depressive phases. While you have occasional thoughts of self-harm, you do not seem to have active plans at this time. Your experiences indicate significant mood instability and associated symptoms that impact your functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of alternating episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> with anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional withdrawal, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, decreased sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, is characteristic of <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The hypomanic episodes are evident from symptoms such as decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, and impulsivity, while the depressive episodes align with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and cognitive disturbances. Anxiety symptoms, including worry, physical tension, and avoidance, are also present, potentially complicating the clinical picture. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature support this diagnosis. The patient's thoughts of self-harm, without active intent, merit careful monitoring but do not currently suggest active suicidal behavior.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including detailed mood history and assessment of episode severity and duration.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (such as lithium or lamotrigine) and targeted psychotherapy, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation and anxiety management.  \n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and provide safety planning if necessary.  \n4. Address comorbid anxiety symptoms with appropriate interventions, which might include relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or medication if indicated.  \n5. Consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management and a therapist for ongoing support to stabilize mood swings and reduce distress.",
