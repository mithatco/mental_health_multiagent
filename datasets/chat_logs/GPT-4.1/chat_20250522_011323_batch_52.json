You also reported engaging in <sym>increased alcohol use</sym> and occasional <sym>smoking</sym>, and you\u2019ve been withdrawing from social connections. Your overall experience reflects significant emotional distress, mood changes, cognitive difficulties, and behavioral symptoms, which seem to be impacting your daily functioning and sense of self.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym>, all lasting at least two weeks, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

The patient's substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism further supports the need for integrated treatment. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms points to a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with features of anxiety and dissociation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk, including safety planning.  \n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, cognitive distortions, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use.  \n4. Develop a safety plan and monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts, with regular follow-up.  \n5. Address substance use issues through counseling or referral to a substance use specialist.  \n6. Explore social support systems and encourage gradual re-engagement with social activities when appropriate.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of affective, cognitive, behavioral, and somatic symptoms indicative of significant psychological distress over the past two weeks. Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, heightened anxiety, and intrusive negative thoughts. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by both hypersomnia and insomnia, coupled with persistent fatigue. Cognitive impairments are noted, including memory difficulties and disorientation. The patient reports emotional numbing, dissociative experiences, and a sense of identity confusion. Social withdrawal and diminished engagement in relationships are observed, alongside maladaptive coping behaviors such as increased alcohol consumption and episodic cigarette use. The presence of passive suicidal ideation, without an active plan or intent, constitutes a notable risk factor requiring careful assessment and monitoring.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a mood disturbance with features suggestive of depression, compounded by significant anxiety symptoms, including social avoidance and panic-like episodes. The coexistence of mood and anxiety symptoms, along with somatic complaints (headaches, stomachaches), suggests a complex affective disorder with comorbid anxiety components. The patient's report of intrusive thoughts and feelings of dissociation further underscores the severity of distress and possible underlying dissociative or trauma-related pathology.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and risk of suicidality given the expressed dark thoughts and passive suicidal ideation. The patient's substance use patterns and social withdrawal are also relevant for treatment planning. Overall, the symptom profile warrants comprehensive assessment for mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, with close attention to safety, as well as development of an appropriate intervention strategy.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a range of difficult feelings and symptoms over the past two weeks. You mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>sad</sym> most days, along with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> that you find hard to control. You're also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including both sleeping more and having trouble sleeping, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>fatigued</sym>. You described <sym>memory problems</sym> and episodes of feeling <sym>dissociated</sym>, where you feel detached from yourself. Additionally, you've had <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dark thoughts</sym>, and some <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic-like feelings</sym>. You also reported engaging in <sym>increased alcohol use</sym> and occasional <sym>smoking</sym>, and you\u2019ve been withdrawing from social connections. Your overall experience reflects significant emotional distress, mood changes, cognitive difficulties, and behavioral symptoms, which seem to be impacting your daily functioning and sense of self.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym>, all lasting at least two weeks, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests an <med>anxiety component</med>, possibly generalized anxiety. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> indicate complex emotional responses, often seen in mood and trauma-related disorders. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without intent or plan are concerning but do not currently meet criteria for <med>Suicidal Behavior Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism further supports the need for integrated treatment. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms points to a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with features of anxiety and dissociation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk, including safety planning.  \n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, cognitive distortions, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use.  \n4. Develop a safety plan and monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts, with regular follow-up.  \n5. Address substance use issues through counseling or referral to a substance use specialist.  \n6. Explore social support systems and encourage gradual re-engagement with social activities when appropriate.",
