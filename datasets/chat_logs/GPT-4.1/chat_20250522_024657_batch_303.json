Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a screening tool that helps us identify different mental health symptoms you might be experiencing across various areas. The purpose is to get a broad picture of your mental health to inform any further steps or support you might need. Please remember that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different domains such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I will ask you each question, and I'd like you to respond based on how you've felt over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>dark thoughts</sym>. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>worried</sym> almost constantly, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>overwhelming anxiety</sym>. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling and staying asleep, are affecting your energy levels, which are already compromised. You described moments of feeling detached from yourself and confused about your identity, as well as occasional forgetfulness. You also reported engaging in <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications, often as a way to cope. Importantly, you shared that you have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is a significant concern that needs careful attention. Your experiences reflect a complex picture of emotional distress, cognitive changes, dissociative symptoms, and substance misuse, all occurring simultaneously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, likely generalized anxiety and panic symptoms. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> involving substance use, along with actual use of alcohol, cigarettes, and other substances, indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be a maladaptive coping mechanism. Dissociative experiences such as feeling detached and confusion about identity further complicate the clinical picture. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms points toward a complex, comorbid presentation that warrants integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed safety evaluation and risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a psychiatric evaluation to consider pharmacotherapy options addressing <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>substance use</med>, possibly including antidepressants and anxiolytics under close supervision.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <quote>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</quote> or <quote>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</quote>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>.  \n4. Support engagement with substance use treatment programs and explore additional resources for managing cravings and reducing use.  \n5. Monitor closely for any worsening of symptoms, especially <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems, if appropriate, to facilitate recovery and provide additional support.",

Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of excessive worry, panic episodes (racing heart, breathing difficulty), and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded situations. Sleep disturbances are reported, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, leading to fatigue. Cognitive concerns include occasional forgetfulness and disorientation. Dissociative experiences such as feeling detached from oneself and a sense of identity confusion are documented, alongside feelings of emotional numbness and social withdrawal.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with evidence of irritability and agitation. The patient reports recurrent intrusive thoughts involving substance use, alongside engagement in substance use behaviors, including alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits, occasional cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed use of medications and other substances for relaxation or sleep. These behaviors, coupled with expressed hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts, indicate heightened clinical risk.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive features, generalized anxiety and panic symptoms, dissociative phenomena, substance use disorder, and passive suicidal ideation. The presence of distressing thought patterns, substance misuse, and emotional dysregulation warrant careful assessment of suicide risk and substance-related complications.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include active suicidal thoughts, substance misuse, panic episodes, social withdrawal, and emotional numbness. These indicators emphasize the need for urgent and comprehensive evaluation, safety planning, and possible intervention to address mental health and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about your current feelings and experiences, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very difficult time. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>dark thoughts</sym>. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>worried</sym> almost constantly, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>overwhelming anxiety</sym>. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling and staying asleep, are affecting your energy levels, which are already compromised. You described moments of feeling detached from yourself and confused about your identity, as well as occasional forgetfulness. You also reported engaging in <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications, often as a way to cope. Importantly, you shared that you have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is a significant concern that needs careful attention. Your experiences reflect a complex picture of emotional distress, cognitive changes, dissociative symptoms, and substance misuse, all occurring simultaneously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, likely generalized anxiety and panic symptoms. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> involving substance use, along with actual use of alcohol, cigarettes, and other substances, indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be a maladaptive coping mechanism. Dissociative experiences such as feeling detached and confusion about identity further complicate the clinical picture. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms points toward a complex, comorbid presentation that warrants integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed safety evaluation and risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a psychiatric evaluation to consider pharmacotherapy options addressing <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>substance use</med>, possibly including antidepressants and anxiolytics under close supervision.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <quote>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</quote> or <quote>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</quote>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>.  \n4. Support engagement with substance use treatment programs and explore additional resources for managing cravings and reducing use.  \n5. Monitor closely for any worsening of symptoms, especially <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems, if appropriate, to facilitate recovery and provide additional support.",
