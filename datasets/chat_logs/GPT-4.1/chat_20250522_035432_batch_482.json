This questionnaire helps us get a broad view of your mental health over the past two weeks across different areas, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer openly and honestly, and if anything is unclear, feel free to ask. Are you ready for us to begin with the first question?"

You also mention feeling <sym>anxious and worried</sym> most of the time, especially about social situations, and tend to avoid social gatherings to manage these feelings. Sleep issues, such as <sym>trouble falling asleep and waking throughout the night</sym>, have contributed to feeling tired during the day.

The presentation is consistent with a mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, with dissociative experiences likely secondary to emotional overwhelm.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), tailored to the patient's symptom profile.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thoughts, social avoidance, and emotional regulation.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, short-term medication or behavioral strategies.  \n5. Monitor for the development of any worsening symptoms or emergent risks, including self-harm or worsening dissociative experiences, and adjust treatment accordingly.",

They also endorse significant anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry, social avoidance, and physical sensations of being on edge, with specific episodes of panic-like feelings related to social and unfamiliar situations. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulty initiating sleep and nocturnal awakenings contributing to daytime fatigue. The patient experiences intrusive anxious thoughts, particularly related to social interactions and self-evaluation, alongside occasional dissociative symptoms such as feeling detached or watching oneself from a distance, especially under stress or overwhelm.\n\nPatterns of concern include social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and heightened anxiety, with no reported suicidal ideation, self-harm, or psychotic features. The patient denies substance misuse, including alcohol and tobacco. There are no indications of impulsivity or increased risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety features, and dissociative experiences. The presentation suggests a comorbid mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, with notable functional impairment related to social avoidance and emotional dysregulation.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs appear limited; the patient denies current suicidal ideation or self-harm, but reports feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about self-identity, warranting close monitoring. The dissociative symptoms and social avoidance may also require further assessment for underlying trauma or other dissociative pathology.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a clinical profile consistent with moderate depressive and anxiety symptomatology, including social avoidance, sleep disruption, and dissociative experiences, with no immediate evidence of acute risk behaviors. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to clarify diagnosis and inform treatment planning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You\u2019ve been feeling <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> and often feel <sym>depressed or hopeless</sym>. You also mention feeling <sym>anxious and worried</sym> most of the time, especially about social situations, and tend to avoid social gatherings to manage these feelings. Sleep issues, such as <sym>trouble falling asleep and waking throughout the night</sym>, have contributed to feeling tired during the day. Additionally, you\u2019ve experienced <sym>intrusive anxious thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like watching yourself from a distance when overwhelmed. Despite these challenges, you do not report thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>auditory or visual hallucinations</sym>. Overall, your symptoms point to a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, which seem to be causing considerable distress and functional impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and low mood</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>worry, social avoidance, and physical sensations of being on edge</sym> suggest co-occurring <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, including episodes of feeling detached or watching oneself, are indicative of <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can occur in the context of significant stress or anxiety. The absence of <sym>psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse</sym> further supports this assessment. The presentation is consistent with a mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, with dissociative experiences likely secondary to emotional overwhelm.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), tailored to the patient's symptom profile.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thoughts, social avoidance, and emotional regulation.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, short-term medication or behavioral strategies.  \n5. Monitor for the development of any worsening symptoms or emergent risks, including self-harm or worsening dissociative experiences, and adjust treatment accordingly.",
