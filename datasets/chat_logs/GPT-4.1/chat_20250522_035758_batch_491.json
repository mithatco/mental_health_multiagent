Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to explore different areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms, to better understand what you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. You're free to answer honestly and openly. Let's begin with the first question."

Your sleep patterns are irregular and non-restorative, and you have difficulty concentrating and remembering things, which may be adding to your sense of being overwhelmed. You also report <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and feeling lost. Anxiety symptoms such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are prominent, and you have acknowledged <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, though you do not have any current plans. Social withdrawal and diminished enjoyment in relationships further suggest significant emotional and psychological strain. Your experiences reflect a serious level of distress that warrants careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, with features of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and physical complaints, suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014such as feeling detached from oneself and a sense of unreality\u2014indicate dissociative features that could be part of a broader trauma-related or dissociative disorder. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are a significant concern requiring ongoing monitoring. The lack of psychotic symptoms or active intent to self-harm at this moment suggests these diagnoses are the most fitting based on the current presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, including detailed exploration of suicidal ideation.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused therapy, tailored to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms.  \n4. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, and consider involving supportive services or social interventions to reduce social withdrawal.",

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia (Q2), feelings of sadness and hopelessness (Q3), irritability (Q4), and emotional numbness. Sleep disturbance is evident, characterized by hypersomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). Cognitive complaints such as concentration difficulties and memory issues are reported (Q16), alongside intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts (Q17). The patient reports dissociative experiences, including feelings of detachment or unreality (Q19), and identity confusion or a sense of loss of self (Q20). Social withdrawal and diminished enjoyment of relationships are noted (Q21).\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches likely related to stress (Q7, Q10). Avoidance behaviors are present, particularly in social contexts (Q9). The patient acknowledges dark thoughts related to self-harm but denies current intent or plans (Q12). No psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions are reported (Q13, Q14). Substance use appears minimal, and there are no indications of substance misuse or excessive alcohol consumption (Q22, Q23, Q24).\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and passive SI (suicidal ideation). The pattern of social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and feelings of being lost suggests possible underlying mood disorder or complex emotional regulation difficulties. The presence of intrusive thoughts warrants careful monitoring. The reported dissociative symptoms and sense of identity disturbance may necessitate further assessment for dissociative or trauma-related conditions.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts, significant functional impairment, social withdrawal, and emotional dysregulation. No current active intent or plan for self-harm is evident.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits marked depressive and anxious symptomatology with dissociative features and passive SI, requiring comprehensive evaluation and a nuanced treatment approach targeting mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.",

      "expected": "adjustment",
      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex blend of emotional distress, including persistent feelings of <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which have significantly impacted your ability to enjoy activities and connect with others. Your sleep patterns are irregular and non-restorative, and you have difficulty concentrating and remembering things, which may be adding to your sense of being overwhelmed. You also report <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and feeling lost. Anxiety symptoms such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are prominent, and you have acknowledged <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, though you do not have any current plans. Social withdrawal and diminished enjoyment in relationships further suggest significant emotional and psychological strain. Your experiences reflect a serious level of distress that warrants careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, with features of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and physical complaints, suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014such as feeling detached from oneself and a sense of unreality\u2014indicate dissociative features that could be part of a broader trauma-related or dissociative disorder. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are a significant concern requiring ongoing monitoring. The lack of psychotic symptoms or active intent to self-harm at this moment suggests these diagnoses are the most fitting based on the current presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, including detailed exploration of suicidal ideation.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-focused therapy, tailored to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms.  \n4. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, and consider involving supportive services or social interventions to reduce social withdrawal.",
