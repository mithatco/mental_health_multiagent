Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks by asking about different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. There's no rush, and you can take your time to answer honestly. Are you ready to begin?"

You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling exhausted despite waking early, along with some cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling lost about your identity and purpose. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming and isolating, especially with the social withdrawal and thoughts of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. Your honesty and openness are important steps toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with <med>generalized anxiety features</med> and cognitive disturbances.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym> (quote: <quote>feeling pretty down most days</quote>), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (quote: <quote>things that used to make me happy just don't excite me anymore</quote>), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (quote: <quote>feel this heavy weight on me, and I can't shake the hopelessness</quote>) align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> (early waking and non-restorative sleep), and cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>worry</sym> and episodic <sym>fear</sym>, along with avoidance behaviors (staying home, social withdrawal), suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>manic symptoms</sym>, or substance misuse indicates a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than other psychiatric conditions. The passive suicidal thoughts warrant careful monitoring but do not appear to involve immediate intent or plans at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> such as an SSRI or SNRI, tailored to the patient's needs and preferences.  \n2. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to address depressive and anxious symptoms, develop coping strategies, and improve mood and functioning.  \n3. Conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation to rule out any physiological causes for sleep disturbances and cognitive issues, and to assess for any underlying medical conditions.  \n4. Provide safety planning and regular monitoring of suicidal ideation, especially given the passive thoughts of self-harm.  \n5. Encourage engagement in gradually increasing activities to combat anhedonia and social withdrawal, along with psychoeducation about depression and anxiety.",

Additionally, anxiety features are evident through reports of persistent worry, tension, and episodic wave-like fears (Q7, Q8), along with avoidance behaviors, notably social withdrawal and staying home (Q9). Sleep disturbances characterized by early awakening and non-restorative sleep are reported, contributing to fatigue (Q5, Q15). Intrusive thoughts of guilt and worthlessness (Q17) further support an internalized symptom profile.\n\nPatterns indicate a combination of depressive and anxious symptomatology, with notable social withdrawal and anhedonia. The patient denies psychotic features, substance misuse, or behaviors suggestive of mania or hypomania. There are no reported current hallucinations, delusions, or compulsive behaviors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, cognitive impairment, and passive suicidal ideation (Q12). The expressed feelings of being lost and disconnected from self and others suggest a significant impact on identity and interpersonal functioning.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts without intent or plans, persistent hopelessness, and social withdrawal, which warrant careful monitoring. Although current substance use appears minimal, ongoing assessment is recommended.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive disturbances, and social isolation, indicating a need for comprehensive assessment and tailored intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a challenging picture of your current experience, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities that once brought you joy, and significant <sym>anxiety</sym> characterized by ongoing worry and episodic waves of <sym>fear</sym>. You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling exhausted despite waking early, along with some cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling lost about your identity and purpose. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming and isolating, especially with the social withdrawal and thoughts of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. Your honesty and openness are important steps toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with <med>generalized anxiety features</med> and cognitive disturbances.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym> (quote: <quote>feeling pretty down most days</quote>), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (quote: <quote>things that used to make me happy just don't excite me anymore</quote>), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (quote: <quote>feel this heavy weight on me, and I can't shake the hopelessness</quote>) align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> (early waking and non-restorative sleep), and cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>worry</sym> and episodic <sym>fear</sym>, along with avoidance behaviors (staying home, social withdrawal), suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, <sym>manic symptoms</sym>, or substance misuse indicates a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than other psychiatric conditions. The passive suicidal thoughts warrant careful monitoring but do not appear to involve immediate intent or plans at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> such as an SSRI or SNRI, tailored to the patient's needs and preferences.  \n2. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to address depressive and anxious symptoms, develop coping strategies, and improve mood and functioning.  \n3. Conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation to rule out any physiological causes for sleep disturbances and cognitive issues, and to assess for any underlying medical conditions.  \n4. Provide safety planning and regular monitoring of suicidal ideation, especially given the passive thoughts of self-harm.  \n5. Encourage engagement in gradually increasing activities to combat anhedonia and social withdrawal, along with psychoeducation about depression and anxiety.",
