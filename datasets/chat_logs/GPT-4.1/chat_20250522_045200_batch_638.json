I'll be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering various areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves me asking you 23 questions about different symptoms, and I'd like you to answer honestly and as openly as you feel comfortable. We'll go through each question one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You also mentioned feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>exhausted</sym> despite waking up early and having difficulty sleeping again, which contributes to a sense of fatigue. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about things beyond your control, along with avoiding situations that make you feel overwhelmed. Physical sensations like headaches and back pain are also present without a clear cause. Additionally, you've described feeling <sym>detached</sym> at times, experiencing <sym>numbness</sym>, and feeling <sym>lost</sym> or disconnected from yourself and others. You\u2019ve had some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is concerning. Overall, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a difficult period with substantial emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges, and I want to acknowledge how hard this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with significant sleep disturbance characterized by early-morning awakening and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive difficulties such as problems with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym> are present. The patient also exhibits <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and somatic complaints like headaches and back pain. Anxiety symptoms are evident through excessive worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance of distressing situations. Dissociative symptoms such as <sym>numbness</sym> and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from oneself are noted. The presence of <quote>passive thoughts of self-harm</quote> indicates a risk that requires careful monitoring. Although no psychotic symptoms are reported, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative symptoms strongly suggests a major depressive episode with comorbid anxiety features and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider initiating <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> treatment, depending on further assessment.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, to address mood symptoms, anxiety, and dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene strategies or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep difficulties persist.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting care plans as needed.",

Cognitive impairments such as concentration and memory difficulties are also reported, alongside somatic complaints including headaches and back pain without clear etiology.\n\nAdditionally, the patient endorses heightened anxiety, characterized by excessive worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance of distressing situations. There are indications of dissociative experiences, such as numbness and a sense of detachment, coupled with feelings of identity confusion and social withdrawal, suggesting possible features of depersonalization/derealization. \n\nA notable risk factor is the presence of passive suicidal ideation without active plans, which warrants careful assessment for risk of self-harm. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional thought content was reported. Substance use appears minimal and within controlled limits.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a predominant depressive symptomatology with concomitant anxiety, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment. The patient's affective state appears chronic and severe, with significant social withdrawal and a sense of disconnection, which could impact functioning and relational capacity.\n\nClinical significance includes the need for further evaluation of depressive disorder (possibly major depressive episode), comorbid anxiety disorder, and dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation underscores the importance of safety planning and ongoing risk assessment. The patient's symptom profile suggests a complex presentation that may benefit from integrated therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, with attention to mood stabilization, anxiety reduction, and dissociative symptom management.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, such as going out or watching TV. You also mentioned feeling <sym>tired</sym> and <sym>exhausted</sym> despite waking up early and having difficulty sleeping again, which contributes to a sense of fatigue. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about things beyond your control, along with avoiding situations that make you feel overwhelmed. Physical sensations like headaches and back pain are also present without a clear cause. Additionally, you've described feeling <sym>detached</sym> at times, experiencing <sym>numbness</sym>, and feeling <sym>lost</sym> or disconnected from yourself and others. You\u2019ve had some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is concerning. Overall, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a difficult period with substantial emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges, and I want to acknowledge how hard this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, along with significant sleep disturbance characterized by early-morning awakening and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive difficulties such as problems with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym> are present. The patient also exhibits <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and somatic complaints like headaches and back pain. Anxiety symptoms are evident through excessive worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance of distressing situations. Dissociative symptoms such as <sym>numbness</sym> and feeling <sym>detached</sym> from oneself are noted. The presence of <quote>passive thoughts of self-harm</quote> indicates a risk that requires careful monitoring. Although no psychotic symptoms are reported, the combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative symptoms strongly suggests a major depressive episode with comorbid anxiety features and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider initiating <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>anxiolytic</med> treatment, depending on further assessment.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, to address mood symptoms, anxiety, and dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene strategies or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep difficulties persist.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting care plans as needed.",
