Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand different areas of your mental health and how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready for me to begin?"

There are prominent features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), evidenced by recurrent intrusive memories, hyperarousal (difficulty sleeping, irritability, being on edge), avoidance behaviors (avoidance of driving and trauma-related stimuli), emotional numbing, and dissociative experiences. The patient reports difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and a sense of disconnection from self and others, which may indicate dissociative symptoms or depersonalization. Sleep disturbances are severe, characterized by frequent awakenings and racing thoughts, compounded by self-medication with alcohol, medications, and tobacco, suggesting maladaptive coping strategies.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a mixture of mood, trauma-related, and dissociative symptoms, with prominent anxiety features including hypervigilance and panic attacks. The patient also reports passive suicidal ideation without active planning, alongside increased substance use and medication misuse, raising concern for safety.\n\nClinical significance includes major depressive features co-occurring with PTSD and dissociative symptoms, compounded by substance use and self-medication behaviors, which may increase risk for deterioration in mental health and suicidality.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs encompass passive suicidal thoughts, substance misuse, medication non-compliance, and dissociative experiences, all warranting careful monitoring and comprehensive intervention planning. The patient's trauma history, current symptom severity, and maladaptive coping mechanisms highlight the need for a multidimensional treatment approach addressing mood, trauma, dissociation, and substance use issues.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex array of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress following a recent traumatic event. They describe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities they once enjoyed, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. These are accompanied by <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>hypervigilance</sym>\u2014all indicative of ongoing <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med>. The patient also reports <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, such as avoiding driving and trauma reminders, which suggest trauma-related symptoms. Additionally, there are concerns about <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, maladaptive coping mechanisms like increased alcohol and medication use, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from self and others. The mixture of mood, trauma, dissociation, and substance use points to a severe level of emotional and psychological distress that warrants careful attention and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (unspecified type, due to maladaptive alcohol and medication use) with dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive re-experiencing</sym> (images and memories of the accident), <sym>avoidance</sym> (avoiding driving and trauma cues), <sym>hyperarousal</sym> (being on edge, sleep difficulties, irritability), and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feelings of detachment and watching oneself from outside. The persistent low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The increased alcohol and medication use indicate maladaptive <med>substance use</med>, likely as a means of self-medication. The severity and breadth of symptoms suggest a complex presentation, possibly requiring a provisional or comorbid diagnosis, but the core features are consistent with PTSD exacerbated by mood and substance issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.\n2. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, including current risk for suicide, and develop a safety plan as needed.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to help manage depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms.\n4. Refer the patient to a substance use specialist for evaluation and development of a tailored treatment plan to address alcohol and medication misuse.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about trauma, dissociation, and healthy coping strategies.\n6. Encourage social support engagement and explore ways to reduce social isolation.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, safety concerns, and response to treatment.",
