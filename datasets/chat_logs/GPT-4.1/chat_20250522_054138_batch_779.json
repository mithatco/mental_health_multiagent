Reports of early morning awakening, sleep disturbances, and fatigue further support a diagnosis of depressive disorder. Cognitive concerns are evident, including recent memory impairment and disorientation in familiar settings, suggesting possible neurocognitive impact. The patient also reports psychomotor slowing, evidenced by reduced energy and motivation to initiate activities.\n\nAdditionally, the patient exhibits passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plans, which warrants careful assessment of risk. Anxiety features are present but less prominent, primarily manifesting as situational worry rather than panic or avoidance behaviors. Somatic complaints such as headaches and bodily aches are noted, which may be psychosomatic or related to somatic health issues.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent theme of emotional numbness, social withdrawal, and feelings of disconnection from self and others, including derealization experiences. These symptoms, alongside mood disturbances, suggest possible comorbidities such as dysthymia or a neurocognitive component.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and significant functional impairment. Absence of substance use or recent risky behaviors reduces immediate concerns for substance-related exacerbation.\n\nIn summary, the clinical picture is dominated by major depressive symptoms with cognitive and affective disturbances, passive suicidal ideation, and mild dissociative experiences. Continuous monitoring for emergent suicidal risk and comprehensive assessment of cognitive function are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You mentioned waking up very early and struggling to get back to sleep, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired</sym> throughout the day. You've also noticed some <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as forgetfulness and getting lost in familiar places, and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> or being outside of yourself at times. Additionally, you've expressed <sym>feelings of being lost</sym> and <sym>withdrawal from social relationships</sym>. While you occasionally think about <quote>it would be easier if I just didn't wake up</quote>, you do not have any current <sym>plans</sym> to hurt yourself. Overall, your symptoms suggest significant emotional distress, affecting your sleep, cognition, and social connections, and these experiences appear to be causing you considerable suffering.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meets criteria for <med>Major depressive disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance characterized by early morning awakening and ongoing fatigue, along with cognitive symptoms such as memory issues and disorientation, further supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicates significant clinical concern, although there are no active plans or intent. Mild dissociative symptoms, such as feeling disconnected, are also noted but do not warrant a separate diagnosis at this stage. The absence of symptoms like panic attacks, compulsive behaviors, or psychotic features suggests a primary mood disorder rather than another psychiatric condition. Overall, the severity and impact of symptoms justify a diagnosis of <med>Major depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, including risk assessment for suicidality.\n2. Consider initiating <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address depressive symptoms.\n3. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medical evaluation to improve sleep quality.\n4. Address cognitive concerns through neurocognitive assessment if symptoms persist or worsen.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression, emphasizing the importance of treatment adherence and safety planning for suicidal thoughts.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary.",
