This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself openly. The assessment consists of 23 questions that cover different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I will ask you each question, and I'd like you to answer honestly about how much or how often you've experienced each problem. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You also described feeling <sym>anxious</sym>, especially in social situations, with episodes where your <sym>heart races</sym> and you feel like you might <sym>lose control</sym>. You tend to <sym>avoid social interactions</sym> out of fear of embarrassment. Additionally, you\u2019ve been experiencing <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, such as waking early and having trouble returning to sleep, along with some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>. While you do not have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, your feelings of <sym>being lost</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym> are significant and impact your daily life. These symptoms suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative features, which require careful assessment and supportive care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, social avoidance, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and worry point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> or <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, including early awakening and difficulty returning to sleep, are common in depression and anxiety. The episodes of <sym>derealization</sym> and feeling <sym>distant</sym> from oneself suggest dissociative features, which can occur with mood and anxiety disorders under stress. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, <sym>psychosis</sym>, or <sym>substance misuse</sym> makes these primary diagnoses more likely. Overall, the clinical picture indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety and dissociative symptoms, warranting comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a full psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.\n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, tailored to the patient's symptoms and preferences.\n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if needed, pharmacologic or behavioral interventions.\n5. Monitor for changes in symptoms, including any emergence of suicidal thoughts or worsening dissociative episodes.\n6. Explore social support options and consider referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist specializing in mood and anxiety disorders.",

Anxiety symptoms are also notable, characterized by excessive worry, social anxiety, and panic-like episodes, particularly in social contexts. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, which may further exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive complaints include episodic forgetfulness and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization. The patient reports a sense of being lost and a lack of close interpersonal connections, indicating potential social isolation and difficulties with identity or self-concept.\n\nPattern Analysis:\n- Mood symptoms (depressed mood, hopelessness) are persistent.\n- Anxiety manifests as generalized worry, social avoidance, and panic symptoms.\n- Sleep issues coexist with anxiety and mood symptoms.\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances, such as derealization, suggest possible dissociative features.\n- No current evidence of suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, psychotic perceptual disturbances, or substance misuse.\n\nClinical Significance:\n- The combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms warrants comprehensive assessment for mood and anxiety disorders.\n- Sleep disturbances and cognitive concerns highlight the need to evaluate for comorbid conditions such as insomnia or dissociative phenomena.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of being lost suggest possible underlying issues with self-identity or interpersonal functioning.\n\nRisk Factors/Warning Signs:\n- No active suicidal or self-harm ideation reported.\n- Symptoms of panic and social avoidance pose potential functional impairments.\n- No substance misuse or behavioral risk factors identified at this time.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits significant depressive and anxiety symptomatology with associated sleep and cognitive disturbances, necessitating further diagnostic clarification and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which have been difficult to shake. You\u2019ve noticed a lack of <sym>interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you previously enjoyed and have been feeling <sym>lost</sym> and <sym>distant from yourself</sym>. You also described feeling <sym>anxious</sym>, especially in social situations, with episodes where your <sym>heart races</sym> and you feel like you might <sym>lose control</sym>. You tend to <sym>avoid social interactions</sym> out of fear of embarrassment. Additionally, you\u2019ve been experiencing <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, such as waking early and having trouble returning to sleep, along with some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>. While you do not have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, your feelings of <sym>being lost</sym> and <sym>disconnection</sym> are significant and impact your daily life. These symptoms suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative features, which require careful assessment and supportive care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, social avoidance, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and worry point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> or <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, including early awakening and difficulty returning to sleep, are common in depression and anxiety. The episodes of <sym>derealization</sym> and feeling <sym>distant</sym> from oneself suggest dissociative features, which can occur with mood and anxiety disorders under stress. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, <sym>psychosis</sym>, or <sym>substance misuse</sym> makes these primary diagnoses more likely. Overall, the clinical picture indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety and dissociative symptoms, warranting comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a full psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.\n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, tailored to the patient's symptoms and preferences.\n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if needed, pharmacologic or behavioral interventions.\n5. Monitor for changes in symptoms, including any emergence of suicidal thoughts or worsening dissociative episodes.\n6. Explore social support options and consider referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist specializing in mood and anxiety disorders.",
