We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to identify any areas that might need further attention or support. Please know that everything you share remains confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The process involves me asking you 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. We can take our time, and you can share as much as you feel comfortable. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Your sleep difficulties, including <sym>reduced sleep duration with heightened arousal</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>concentration and memory</sym>, are impacting your daily functioning. You also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> characterized by <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, especially in social situations. Additionally, you report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>rituals</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation or detachment</sym>. Substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, appears to be a maladaptive attempt to cope, which raises concern about potential dependence and increased risk of harm. The presence of <sym>self-injurious thoughts</sym> highlights the importance of safety and close monitoring. Overall, your symptoms suggest a multifaceted mental health condition that requires comprehensive evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, recurrent, moderate severity, with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and substance use concerns.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. The reported <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors align with <med>GAD</med>. The intrusive thoughts, rituals, and dissociative feelings suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features or related anxiety phenomena. The substance use\u2014excessive alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana\u2014may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms and could exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates high risk, requiring urgent attention. The overall symptom profile supports a diagnosis of a mood disorder with anxious features, compounded by substance use issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, and consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and substance use reduction.\n3. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-injurious behavior</sym>, involving close monitoring and support systems.\n4. Address substance use through brief interventions, motivational interviewing, or referral to specialized addiction services.\n5. Consider medical evaluation for physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, to rule out underlying medical conditions.\n6. Regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication side effects, and adherence to treatment plans.",

There are prominent anxiety symptoms evidenced by pervasive worry (A7), panic-like episodes (A8), and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social contexts (A9). Intrusive, repetitive thoughts and mental rituals suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features (A17, A18). The patient reports feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (A19), and existential distress manifesting as feelings of identity confusion and detachment (A20), along with anhedonia in relationships (A21).\n\nSubstance use appears problematic, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels (A22), regular cigarette smoking (A23), and misuse of prescription medications and recreational drugs such as marijuana (A24), indicating potential maladaptive coping mechanisms and increased risk factors for self-harm.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include suicidal ideation (A12), self-injurious thoughts, substance misuse, and sleep disruption, all of which warrant close monitoring.

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Your sleep difficulties, including <sym>reduced sleep duration with heightened arousal</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>concentration and memory</sym>, are impacting your daily functioning. You also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> characterized by <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, especially in social situations. Additionally, you report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>rituals</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation or detachment</sym>. Substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, appears to be a maladaptive attempt to cope, which raises concern about potential dependence and increased risk of harm. The presence of <sym>self-injurious thoughts</sym> highlights the importance of safety and close monitoring. Overall, your symptoms suggest a multifaceted mental health condition that requires comprehensive evaluation and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, recurrent, moderate severity, with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and substance use concerns.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. The reported <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors align with <med>GAD</med>. The intrusive thoughts, rituals, and dissociative feelings suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features or related anxiety phenomena. The substance use\u2014excessive alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana\u2014may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms and could exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates high risk, requiring urgent attention. The overall symptom profile supports a diagnosis of a mood disorder with anxious features, compounded by substance use issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, and consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and substance use reduction.\n3. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-injurious behavior</sym>, involving close monitoring and support systems.\n4. Address substance use through brief interventions, motivational interviewing, or referral to specialized addiction services.\n5. Consider medical evaluation for physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, to rule out underlying medical conditions.\n6. Regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication side effects, and adherence to treatment plans.",
