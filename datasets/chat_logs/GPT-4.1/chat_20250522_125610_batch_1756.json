      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms. You've felt a persistent <sym>lack of interest and pleasure in activities</sym>, along with a <sym>depressed mood</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. These feelings seem to be quite overwhelming, and you've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>, with very little rest and feeling wired. You also described episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> that were terrifying, accompanied by physical sensations of fear and thoughts of losing control. Your avoidance of certain situations like crowded places indicates significant anxiety, which has led you to withdraw from social interactions. You mentioned intrusive <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and <sym>checking behaviors</sym> as well as some <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> like feeling detached from yourself. While you've had some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, you clarified that you haven't acted on these. Overall, you're experiencing a complex mix of mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and dissociative symptoms that are impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate Severity</med> with comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (specifically checking rituals and intrusive thoughts). There are also signs of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> and sleep disturbance.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by intense fear, physical symptoms, and avoidance behaviors point to <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive checking behaviors suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The feelings of detachment and moments of losing sense of self are indicative of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The sleep problems and ongoing anxiety further support this clinical picture. The patient's reported thoughts of self-harm, without current intent, indicate a need for safety monitoring but do not currently meet criteria for a specific <med>Suicidal Disorder</med> diagnosis. Overall, the symptom profile points to a mood disorder complicated by anxiety and dissociative features, requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to target both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on managing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>.  \n4. Address sleep disturbance with sleep hygiene education and consider further assessment if sleep issues persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, and consider referral to a psychiatrist or sleep specialist if needed.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including pervasive anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), feelings of hopelessness (\"think things will never get better\"), and persistent low mood. There are also significant indications of anxiety pathology, evidenced by reports of pervasive worry, heightened arousal (\"always on edge\"), and avoidance behaviors related to panic symptoms (\"avoiding crowded stores and public transportation\"). The patient reports panic attacks characterized by intense fear and physical sensations of terror, alongside behaviors aimed at avoiding situations perceived as triggers.\n\nSleep disturbance is notable, with reports of difficulty maintaining sleep, contributing to daytime exhaustion. Intrusive, obsessive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggest comorbid obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Transient dissociative experiences (\"feeling outside of my body\") and moments of identity uncertainty reflect dissociative features, possibly linked to anxiety or emotional dysregulation.\n\nThe patient endorses suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\") but denies current intent or plan, indicating a need for ongoing risk assessment. No psychotic symptoms such as auditory or thought insertion experiences are reported. Substance use appears to be minimal, with occasional alcohol and tobacco use, and no recent misuse of prescribed or illicit drugs.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Symptom overlap of depression and anxiety with moderate severity.\n- Evidence of panic disorder features, including panic attacks and avoidance behaviors.\n- Sleep disruption and intrusive thoughts reinforce the clinical picture of comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- Dissociative sensations and identity concerns suggest heightened emotional distress.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Presence of suicidal thoughts warrants careful monitoring.\n- Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors increase functional impairment and safety concerns.\n- Sleep disturbance and intrusive thoughts may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety with panic features, sleep disturbance, compulsive behaviors, and dissociative experiences. The presence of suicidal ideation necessitates a thorough safety assessment. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment plan focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety planning is recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms. You've felt a persistent <sym>lack of interest and pleasure in activities</sym>, along with a <sym>depressed mood</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. These feelings seem to be quite overwhelming, and you've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>, with very little rest and feeling wired. You also described episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> that were terrifying, accompanied by physical sensations of fear and thoughts of losing control. Your avoidance of certain situations like crowded places indicates significant anxiety, which has led you to withdraw from social interactions. You mentioned intrusive <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and <sym>checking behaviors</sym> as well as some <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> like feeling detached from yourself. While you've had some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, you clarified that you haven't acted on these. Overall, you're experiencing a complex mix of mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and dissociative symptoms that are impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate Severity</med> with comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (specifically checking rituals and intrusive thoughts). There are also signs of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> and sleep disturbance.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by intense fear, physical symptoms, and avoidance behaviors point to <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive checking behaviors suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The feelings of detachment and moments of losing sense of self are indicative of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The sleep problems and ongoing anxiety further support this clinical picture. The patient's reported thoughts of self-harm, without current intent, indicate a need for safety monitoring but do not currently meet criteria for a specific <med>Suicidal Disorder</med> diagnosis. Overall, the symptom profile points to a mood disorder complicated by anxiety and dissociative features, requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to target both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on managing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>.  \n4. Address sleep disturbance with sleep hygiene education and consider further assessment if sleep issues persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, and consider referral to a psychiatrist or sleep specialist if needed.",
