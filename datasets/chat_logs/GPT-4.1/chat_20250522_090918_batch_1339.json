Today, we're going to go through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to get an overview of various mental health domains and symptoms you might be experiencing, which can help us determine the best way to support you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space where you can be honest about your feelings and experiences. We'll be going through 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, thoughts, and others. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You feel <sym>persistent sadness and emotional numbness</sym>, along with <sym>hopeless thoughts</sym>. You also describe feeling <sym>irritable and easily angered</sym>, and you have been struggling with <sym>constant worry, anxiety, and panic attacks</sym>. These panic episodes seem to come unexpectedly and are accompanied by physical sensations like a racing heart and difficulty breathing, which can be very frightening. You avoid crowded and public places out of fear of having a panic attack, and sleep problems, including insomnia and frequent awakenings, are significantly affecting your energy and mental clarity. You also mention feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym> at times, and occasional <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>. Despite these challenges, you report no hallucinations or delusions, and you haven't been using substances or engaging in compulsive behaviors beyond checking behaviors out of worry. Your feelings of being overwhelmed and uncertain about your identity or life direction are understandable given these circumstances, and it is clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (severe, with anxious distress)</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, with episodic <med>Panic Disorder</med>. There are also signs of <med>emotional disconnection and self-harm ideation</med> that require careful monitoring.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient demonstrates core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>persistent feelings of sadness, anhedonia, hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance. The pervasive and excessive worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The recurrent panic attacks, including <sym>physiological symptoms such as racing heart and shortness of breath</sym> and agoraphobic avoidance, support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>feelings of disconnection from self and environment</sym> and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> indicate significant emotional distress that warrants careful assessment. The symptoms do not suggest psychosis or substance misuse. Overall, the clinical picture reflects a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnoses, assess safety, and explore history thoroughly.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and establish close monitoring for suicidal ideation.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), considering potential benefits for both depression and anxiety.  \n4. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on anxiety management, panic attack coping skills, and mood regulation.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation for sleep issues.  \n6. Encourage ongoing support and psychoeducation about anxiety and depression to empower the patient in managing symptoms.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of depression, characterized by emotional numbness, hopelessness, and a sense of emotional heaviness. The patient reports persistent generalized anxiety, with near-constant worry, restlessness, and difficulty relaxing, alongside episodic panic attacks marked by physiological symptoms such as racing heart, shortness of breath, and fear of losing control or dying. Avoidance behaviors, particularly of social and public situations, suggest agoraphobic tendencies closely linked to panic symptoms.\n\nSleep disturbance is prominent, with reports of insomnia and frequent awakenings contributing to mental exhaustion. Cognitive concerns include feelings of disconnection from oneself and some uncertainty about identity or life direction, which may reflect underlying dissociative or identity-related issues. The patient acknowledges recurrent negative, intrusive thoughts about health and panic episodes, with some self-harm ideation noted, albeit without current intent or action.\n\nPatterns indicate a chronic presentation of mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable impairment in social functioning and emotional regulation. The patient denies psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors beyond checking rituals, and reports no hallucinations or delusional experiences.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness)\n- Generalized anxiety disorder features, including persistent worry and irritability\n- Panic disorder with agoraphobic avoidance\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue\n- Passive suicidal ideation\n- Feelings of emotional disconnection and identity uncertainty\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants close monitoring\n- Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors increase functional impairment and safety considerations\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness may suggest risk for worsening mood or emergent suicidality if unaddressed\n\n**Overall,** the patient's presentation is characterized by severe anxiety and depressive symptoms with episodic panic attacks, sleep disturbance, and social withdrawal. These findings warrant comprehensive assessment, safety evaluation, and development of an integrated treatment plan targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety concerns.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a complex mix of emotional and physical symptoms. You feel <sym>persistent sadness and emotional numbness</sym>, along with <sym>hopeless thoughts</sym>. You also describe feeling <sym>irritable and easily angered</sym>, and you have been struggling with <sym>constant worry, anxiety, and panic attacks</sym>. These panic episodes seem to come unexpectedly and are accompanied by physical sensations like a racing heart and difficulty breathing, which can be very frightening. You avoid crowded and public places out of fear of having a panic attack, and sleep problems, including insomnia and frequent awakenings, are significantly affecting your energy and mental clarity. You also mention feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym> at times, and occasional <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>. Despite these challenges, you report no hallucinations or delusions, and you haven't been using substances or engaging in compulsive behaviors beyond checking behaviors out of worry. Your feelings of being overwhelmed and uncertain about your identity or life direction are understandable given these circumstances, and it is clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (severe, with anxious distress)</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, with episodic <med>Panic Disorder</med>. There are also signs of <med>emotional disconnection and self-harm ideation</med> that require careful monitoring.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient demonstrates core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>persistent feelings of sadness, anhedonia, hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance. The pervasive and excessive worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The recurrent panic attacks, including <sym>physiological symptoms such as racing heart and shortness of breath</sym> and agoraphobic avoidance, support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>feelings of disconnection from self and environment</sym> and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> indicate significant emotional distress that warrants careful assessment. The symptoms do not suggest psychosis or substance misuse. Overall, the clinical picture reflects a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnoses, assess safety, and explore history thoroughly.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and establish close monitoring for suicidal ideation.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), considering potential benefits for both depression and anxiety.  \n4. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on anxiety management, panic attack coping skills, and mood regulation.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation for sleep issues.  \n6. Encourage ongoing support and psychoeducation about anxiety and depression to empower the patient in managing symptoms.",
