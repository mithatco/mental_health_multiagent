It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing a combination of persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that interfere with your daily life. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, intrusive thoughts, and difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>cognitive functioning</sym>. It\u2019s also concerning that you\u2019ve had <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym> and have been withdrawing from social connections. Your experiences of panic, physical discomfort, and emotional turmoil highlight the severity of your current distress, and it\u2019s important that you receive compassionate, comprehensive support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features> and active <sym>Suicidal Ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty functioning over the past two weeks are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts, feelings of <sym>derealization</sym>, and cognitive disturbances point toward dissociative or psychotic-like features, which can occur in severe mood disorders. The active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate an urgent risk that warrants immediate attention. While somatic complaints are noted, they seem largely stress-related rather than indicative of a primary somatic disorder. Overall, the constellation of symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxious features and suicidality.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.  \n2. Initiate immediate crisis intervention if the patient reports active plans or intent to harm themselves.  \n3. Refer for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) and/or psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-informed therapy).  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and implement behavioral strategies to improve sleep hygiene.  \n5. Explore possible underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to cognitive and somatic symptoms, with referrals as needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of ongoing treatment and support.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing picture of your current mental state. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing a combination of persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that interfere with your daily life. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, intrusive thoughts, and difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>cognitive functioning</sym>. It\u2019s also concerning that you\u2019ve had <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym> and have been withdrawing from social connections. Your experiences of panic, physical discomfort, and emotional turmoil highlight the severity of your current distress, and it\u2019s important that you receive compassionate, comprehensive support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features> and active <sym>Suicidal Ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty functioning over the past two weeks are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts, feelings of <sym>derealization</sym>, and cognitive disturbances point toward dissociative or psychotic-like features, which can occur in severe mood disorders. The active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate an urgent risk that warrants immediate attention. While somatic complaints are noted, they seem largely stress-related rather than indicative of a primary somatic disorder. Overall, the constellation of symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxious features and suicidality.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment and develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.  \n2. Initiate immediate crisis intervention if the patient reports active plans or intent to harm themselves.  \n3. Refer for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) and/or psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, trauma-informed therapy).  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and implement behavioral strategies to improve sleep hygiene.  \n5. Explore possible underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to cognitive and somatic symptoms, with referrals as needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of ongoing treatment and support.",
