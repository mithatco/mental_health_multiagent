We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool that helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. This assessment consists of 23 questions covering various areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and thoughts. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also described experiencing <sym>persistent fatigue</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these ongoing struggles make you feel <sym>lost</sym> and <sym>distant</sym> from yourself and those around you. You mentioned feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> and <sym>scared</sym> at times, especially with intrusive dark thoughts, and you indicated some passive thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym>. Your social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection further highlight the depth of your current distress. I want you to know that your experiences are very real, and it\u2019s courageous of you to share them. You're facing multiple interconnected challenges, and I am here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>emotional numbness</sym>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, and <sym>intrusive dark thoughts</sym> further support this diagnosis. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and confusion about your identity, are often associated with severe depression or trauma-related conditions but in this context seem to be a part of the depressive picture. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate a risk that warrants close monitoring, though there are no current plans or intent. Anxiety symptoms are also present but appear secondary to the primary depressive disorder. Given the overall pattern and impact on your functioning, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> appears to be the most fitting diagnosis, though ongoing assessment is important to rule out other conditions such as trauma-related or dissociative disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Engage in a comprehensive mental health evaluation to explore underlying trauma or dissociative symptoms and to assess suicide risk more thoroughly.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> combined with <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, tailored to address depression and anxiety.  \n3. Develop a safety plan, including close monitoring of suicidal thoughts, and establish support systems involving trusted individuals.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and possibly a trauma specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or intensify.  \n5. Explore supportive interventions such as mindfulness, psychoeducation, and social engagement strategies to help reduce feelings of isolation and improve emotional regulation.",

There are notable mood disturbances including irritability (A4), persistent fatigue and sleep disturbances (A5, A15), and concentration and memory impairments (A16). The patient reports ongoing anxiety (A7), accompanied by physical manifestations such as unexplained headaches and muscle pains (A10), and episodes of feeling overwhelmed and frightened (A8). \n\nDissociative experiences are evident through reports of depersonalization and detachment (A19), alongside a sense of confusion regarding identity and life direction (A20). Social withdrawal is apparent, with diminished emotional connection and enjoyment in relationships (A21). The presence of dark, intrusive thoughts (A17) raises concern for underlying mood or trauma-related pathology. \n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without current plans or intent (A12), which signifies a potential suicide risk warranting close monitoring. No evidence was found for psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts (A13, A14). Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol or tobacco consumption (A22, A23), and no recent medication misuse (A24).\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant depressive symptomatology with significant anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional withdrawal.\n- Co-occurring anxiety features and somatic complaints.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity confusion suggest possible comorbid dissociative or trauma-related issues.\n- Passive suicidal ideation indicates a need for safety assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without current intent.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness.\n- Social withdrawal and detachment.\n- Intrusive dark thoughts.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation involving major depressive features, symptoms of anxiety, dissociation, and passive suicidal ideation. These findings necessitate comprehensive risk assessment, safety planning, and targeted treatment interventions addressing mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared with me feelings of profound <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>emotional numbness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. You also described experiencing <sym>persistent fatigue</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these ongoing struggles make you feel <sym>lost</sym> and <sym>distant</sym> from yourself and those around you. You mentioned feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> and <sym>scared</sym> at times, especially with intrusive dark thoughts, and you indicated some passive thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym>. Your social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection further highlight the depth of your current distress. I want you to know that your experiences are very real, and it\u2019s courageous of you to share them. You're facing multiple interconnected challenges, and I am here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>emotional numbness</sym>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>, and <sym>intrusive dark thoughts</sym> further support this diagnosis. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and confusion about your identity, are often associated with severe depression or trauma-related conditions but in this context seem to be a part of the depressive picture. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate a risk that warrants close monitoring, though there are no current plans or intent. Anxiety symptoms are also present but appear secondary to the primary depressive disorder. Given the overall pattern and impact on your functioning, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> appears to be the most fitting diagnosis, though ongoing assessment is important to rule out other conditions such as trauma-related or dissociative disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Engage in a comprehensive mental health evaluation to explore underlying trauma or dissociative symptoms and to assess suicide risk more thoroughly.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> combined with <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, tailored to address depression and anxiety.  \n3. Develop a safety plan, including close monitoring of suicidal thoughts, and establish support systems involving trusted individuals.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and possibly a trauma specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or intensify.  \n5. Explore supportive interventions such as mindfulness, psychoeducation, and social engagement strategies to help reduce feelings of isolation and improve emotional regulation.",
