They report <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>mood swings</sym> that include episodes of increased energy, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep, which suggest episodes of <med>hypomania</med> or <med>mania</med>.

Monitor for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and substance misuse, providing crisis resources or safety planning as needed.  \n4. Consider referrals to specialists, including a psychiatrist for medication management and a substance use counselor, to support recovery and stability.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex mood and behavioral profile characterized by significant mood variability, including depressive symptoms and episodes suggestive of elevated mood or irritability. Key symptoms include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, irritability, and social withdrawal during depressive states. There are reports of increased activity, impulsivity, and decreased sleep during hypomanic or manic episodes, alongside recent difficulties with sleep regulation, fatigue, and restlessness. The patient exhibits symptoms consistent with mood dysregulation, including mood swings and periods of impulsivity such as impulsive spending.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are notable, with reports of pervasive worry, feeling on edge, avoidance behaviors, and moments of overwhelm. Somatic complaints (headaches, muscle pains) may be stress-related. The patient acknowledges recurrent negative ruminative thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt, with occasional passive suicidal ideation without intent or active planning. Dissociative experiences (feeling detached or surreal) are reported during mood fluctuations, and identity-related concerns are evident during depressive phases.\n\nSubstance use patterns include increased alcohol consumption (multiple episodes of \u22654 drinks weekly) and smoking (occasionally), with some misuse of prescribed medications, indicating potential maladaptive coping mechanisms. No psychotic symptoms or perceptual disturbances are reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Fluctuating mood states with depressive and hypomanic/manic features.\n- Elevated impulsivity, risky behaviors, and decreased need for sleep during manic episodes.\n- Chronic anxiety and avoidance behaviors impacting social and occupational functioning.\n- Recurrent negative ruminations and feelings of emotional numbness or dissociation.\n- Substance use as a potential maladaptive coping response.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without active intent.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors, including impulsive spending and substance use.\n- Mood instability and dissociative experiences during mood episodes.\n- Increased alcohol use and medication misuse, which may exacerbate mood symptoms or increase risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient demonstrates a pattern consistent with bipolar spectrum features, marked by episodic mood swings involving depressive and hypomanic/manic symptoms, accompanied by significant anxiety, impulsivity, substance use, and dissociative phenomena. These clinical features warrant further comprehensive assessment to delineate mood disorder diagnosis, evaluate risk levels, and inform targeted intervention strategies.",

The reasoning provided aligns with characteristic features of bipolar disorder, including mood fluctuations, episodic mood states, and absence of psychosis. While comorbidities are noted, the primary diagnosis clearly indicates bipolar, matching the expected profile.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes experiencing persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness and guilt</sym>. They report <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>mood swings</sym> that include episodes of increased energy, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep, which suggest episodes of <med>hypomania</med> or <med>mania</med>. These mood fluctuations are accompanied by significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, with feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>overwhelmed</sym>, as well as avoidance behaviors and somatic complaints like headaches and muscle pains. The patient also reports <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> during mood episodes, <sym>identity questions</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>. Substance use, including alcohol and occasional smoking, appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, and there is evidence of <sym>medication misuse</sym>. Overall, the presentation reflects a complex mood and behavioral profile with significant impairment and variability.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med> and <med>Substance use</med> behaviors\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worst feelings of worthlessness</sym> aligns with depressive features. The episodes of <sym>elevated or irritable mood</sym>, <sym>increased activity</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, and <sym>impulsivity</sym> suggest <med>hypomanic</med> episodes. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and the pattern of mood fluctuations over time support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and avoidance behaviors further complicate the clinical picture, indicating comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med>. The use of substances appears to be an attempt at self-medication, which warrants attention but does not solely define the primary mood disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history of mood episodes, duration, severity, and impact on functioning, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other mood or medical conditions.  \n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan that includes <med>psychiatric medication</med> (such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) to address mood instability, anxiety, and substance use.  \n3. Monitor for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and substance misuse, providing crisis resources or safety planning as needed.  \n4. Consider referrals to specialists, including a psychiatrist for medication management and a substance use counselor, to support recovery and stability.",
