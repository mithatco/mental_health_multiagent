We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to help us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various emotional and behavioral areas, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer honestly and openly, and if you're unsure about a question, just do your best. I'm ready to start with the first question now."

There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or self-harm, but the severity of symptoms warrants clinical intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on social anxiety and depressive symptoms, including exposure strategies and cognitive restructuring.\n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation to assess the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to help manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, treatment for insomnia or other sleep disturbances.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression to help the patient understand their experiences and encourage engagement in treatment.\n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including increased hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm, and develop a safety plan if needed.",

Key features include persistent feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, irritability, and irritability, which may suggest comorbid depressive features. The patient reports ongoing generalized anxiety, manifesting as chronic worry, restlessness, and panic episodes specifically associated with social situations. Sleep disturbance is evident, with difficulty maintaining restful sleep and early awakenings, contributing to overall distress.\n\nIntrusive thoughts concerning social mistakes and embarrassment, along with feelings of dissociation or emotional numbness during heightened anxiety, further support the presence of anxiety-related symptomatology. The patient demonstrates avoidance of social settings and difficulty establishing close relationships, which may impact social functioning and quality of life.\n\nThere are no indications of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or self-harm ideation. The patient denies recent substance use or suicidal ideation but reports feeling overwhelmed and confused about personal identity and life goals, which could reflect identity disturbances or emotional dysregulation.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Core symptoms of social anxiety disorder with associated panic attacks.\n- Symptoms of depression, including anhedonia, hopelessness, and anhedonia.\n- Sleep disturbances contributing to emotional dysregulation.\n- Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal impacting interpersonal functioning.\n- Presence of intrusive and ruminative thoughts related to social interactions.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Chronic anxiety and avoidance behaviors may predispose to functional impairment.\n- Feelings of hopelessness warrant monitoring for risk of depression or suicidal ideation, despite current negative report.\n- No current evidence of self-harm or substance misuse, reducing immediate risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits significant social anxiety with comorbid depressive features, marked by pervasive social fears, avoidance, intrusive ruminations, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms collectively impair social and emotional functioning, necessitating targeted therapeutic intervention focusing on anxiety management, cognitive restructuring, and possible behavioral exposure strategies. Ongoing assessment for mood symptoms and safety planning should be maintained.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience ongoing <sym>feelings of hopelessness and sadness</sym>, along with a diminished interest in activities you once enjoyed. You often feel <sym>irritable and tense</sym>, especially in social situations, and worry frequently about what others think of you. These feelings seem to cause you significant distress and avoidance of social interactions, which makes it harder for you to connect with others and enjoy relationships. You also report experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts about past social mistakes</sym> and feeling disconnected or detached at times, especially when overwhelmed. Your sleep is often restless, with difficulty staying asleep, and you sometimes feel confused about who you are or what you want in life. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex picture involving anxiety, depression, and social withdrawal, which appear to be impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>fear and avoidance of social situations</sym>, along with <sym>panic attacks</sym> related to social events, strongly suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness</sym> indicates comorbid depression, which is common in individuals with social anxiety. The chronic worry, restlessness, and sleep disturbances further support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation or emotional numbness</sym> align with anxiety-related ruminations and emotional regulation difficulties. There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or self-harm, but the severity of symptoms warrants clinical intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on social anxiety and depressive symptoms, including exposure strategies and cognitive restructuring.\n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation to assess the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to help manage anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, treatment for insomnia or other sleep disturbances.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression to help the patient understand their experiences and encourage engagement in treatment.\n5. Monitor for any escalation of symptoms, including increased hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm, and develop a safety plan if needed.",
