We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps identify areas that might need further attention and ensures we're considering all aspects of your well-being. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Notably, they experience heightened irritability and increased social anxiety, evidenced by avoidance of social gatherings, frequent worry about social interactions, and panic attacks in social contexts. Sleep disturbance is evident, with insomnia symptoms such as early awakening and difficulty initiating sleep, despite maintained energy levels. The patient also describes pervasive feelings of nervousness, tension, and being on edge, which contribute to avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal.\n\nNo evidence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), compulsive behaviors, dissociation, or self-harm ideation emerges from the responses. Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol misuse or tobacco use, and no reported misuse of medications or illicit drugs.\n\nClinically, the predominant concerns involve symptoms consistent with depressive features (anhedonia, hopelessness), social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The patient\u2019s avoidance behaviors, panic episodes, and mood symptoms suggest significant psychosocial impairment. Risk factors include social isolation, ongoing emotional distress, and physical symptoms associated with anxiety. No immediate risk of harm to self or others is indicated based on the provided data.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation reflects a complex interplay of depressive and anxiety symptoms, primarily driven by social fears and emotional dysregulation, warranting comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and behaviors. You often feel <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> that you used to enjoy, and at times, you feel <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym>, especially when thinking about social situations. You also notice increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym> and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> when faced with social interactions. Sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty falling asleep and waking early, yet you still feel <sym>energetic</sym>. You tend to <sym>avoid social gatherings</sym> to manage your <sym>anxiety</sym>, and you experience <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> related to stress. Although you sometimes feel <sym>lost or unsure about your goals</sym>, you don't have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>hear voices</sym>. Overall, your symptoms indicate significant emotional distress, social anxiety, and mood challenges that impact your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (recurrent depression and anhedonia) and social anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nYour reports of persistent <sym>worry and feeling on edge</sym>, combined with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance of social situations, are characteristic of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>diminished interest, feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The avoidance behaviors and fear of social scrutiny suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic symptoms, compulsions, or self-harm ideation indicates that these are not primary features of your presentation. The combination of anxiety and depressive symptoms appears to be impacting your overall wellbeing, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Seek a thorough clinical evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm diagnoses and assess severity. <br>\n2. Consider psychotherapy options such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is effective for anxiety, depression, and social fears.<br>\n3.

Develop coping strategies for managing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, possibly including relaxation techniques and sleep hygiene practices.<br>\n5. Explore social skills training or support groups to reduce social avoidance and improve interpersonal connections.",
