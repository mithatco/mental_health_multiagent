      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you\u2019ve been experiencing a variety of challenging symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, such as reading and socializing. These feelings seem to be coupled with ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly in social situations, where you worry about embarrassing yourself and tend to avoid social gatherings. You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, as well as occasional <sym>forgetfulness</sym> when overwhelmed or anxious. Physical sensations like <sym>headaches</sym> and muscle tension are present, likely related to your anxiety. You\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about not wanting to be here, although you have not made any plans or intent to harm yourself. Overall, these symptoms reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns that are affecting your emotional well-being and social functioning. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences, and I am here to support you through this process.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>anxiety related to social situations</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>anticipatory worry</sym> point toward a <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> component. The sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and waking during the night, are consistent with <med>Insomnia</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive worries</sym> and <sym>rumination</sym> further support this diagnosis. Although there are no indications of psychotic features or severe mood instability, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests a complex internalizing disorder. The <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm warrant ongoing monitoring but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, including screening for suicidal risk.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depressive and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacologic options.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of depression and anxiety, and develop coping strategies to manage intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

Concurrently, there are significant anxiety features, including pervasive worry, social avoidance, and anticipatory apprehension, especially in social and performance-related contexts. The patient reports difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance, alongside cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and intrusive, ruminative thoughts centered on social fears and embarrassment. Somatic complaints include tension-related headaches and muscle tightness, correlating with heightened anxiety levels.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with social avoidance behaviors and situational anxiety being prominent. There is evidence of emotional distress impacting social functioning and self-perception, yet no indications of psychotic features or disorganized thinking. Suicidal ideation is present but without current plans or intent, warranting ongoing monitoring. The patient denies substance misuse and psychotic experiences.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder possibly comorbid with social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety features. The presence of sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, and negative self-evaluation further support this assessment. Risk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and social withdrawal, which necessitate careful clinical attention.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation reflects significant internalizing symptoms with functional impairment, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention to address mood, anxiety, and social avoidance behaviors.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you\u2019ve been experiencing a variety of challenging symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, such as reading and socializing. These feelings seem to be coupled with ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly in social situations, where you worry about embarrassing yourself and tend to avoid social gatherings. You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, as well as occasional <sym>forgetfulness</sym> when overwhelmed or anxious. Physical sensations like <sym>headaches</sym> and muscle tension are present, likely related to your anxiety. You\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about not wanting to be here, although you have not made any plans or intent to harm yourself. Overall, these symptoms reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns that are affecting your emotional well-being and social functioning. I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences, and I am here to support you through this process.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Insomnia</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>anxiety related to social situations</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>anticipatory worry</sym> point toward a <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> component. The sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and waking during the night, are consistent with <med>Insomnia</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive worries</sym> and <sym>rumination</sym> further support this diagnosis. Although there are no indications of psychotic features or severe mood instability, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests a complex internalizing disorder. The <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm warrant ongoing monitoring but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, including screening for suicidal risk.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depressive and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacologic options.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of depression and anxiety, and develop coping strategies to manage intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
