Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your emotional and psychological well-being and is confidential, meaning your responses are private and used solely to inform your care. The process involves me asking you 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and more, and I would appreciate honest and detailed answers to each. Are you ready for us to begin with the first question?"

Elevated irritability, agitation, and impulsivity suggest affective dysregulation. Anxiety features are evident through reports of heightened worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are reported as difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, alongside subjective cognitive complaints such as impaired memory and disorientation.\n\nThe patient endorses recurrent intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors, alongside episodes of dissociation characterized by feelings of disconnection from self and surroundings. There is mention of episodic panic-like sensations and moments of overwhelming fear. Additionally, the patient admits to self-injurious ideation, with some intent to harm, representing a significant risk factor requiring immediate attention.\n\nSubstance use is notable, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels and regular cigarette smoking, often heightened during stress, raising concerns about potential dependency and maladaptive coping strategies. Use of non-prescribed medications further underscores possible substance misuse.\n\nPatterns suggest a constellation of depressive symptoms intertwined with anxiety features, impulsivity, dissociation, and substance use, contributing to overall functional impairment. The presence of suicidal ideation, combined with substance misuse and social withdrawal, warrants urgent clinical assessment and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with significant mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences, substance use issues, and suicidal thoughts, indicating a complex clinical profile necessitating comprehensive evaluation and intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your current mental health experience. You\u2019re going through significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including a persistent loss of interest or pleasure in activities, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low mood</sym> most days. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>angry</sym> more easily, along with <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014worrying excessively, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoiding social situations that make you uncomfortable. Sleep difficulties and cognitive issues like memory problems have been affecting you, and you mentioned experiencing <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>. Additionally, you reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, and recent <sym>substance use</sym> including alcohol and tobacco, which may be exacerbating your difficulties. Your experiences reflect a distressing, multifaceted mental health picture that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Major Depressive Episode</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The notable presence of <sym>worry, feeling on edge, avoidance behaviors</sym>, and physical symptoms of anxiety suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, and episodes of feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> point to additional complexity, potentially involving trauma-related or dissociative symptoms. The <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and recent <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol exceeding moderate levels and cigarette smoking\u2014indicate <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be serving as maladaptive coping. Overall, the presentation reflects a severe, intersecting pattern of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a full clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and risk, to determine immediate safety needs.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing self-harm thoughts and substance use, potentially involving crisis resources.\n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for mood and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Consider psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacotherapy targeting depression, anxiety, and substance use.\n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and medical evaluation.\n6. Explore support groups or community resources for additional social connection and recovery support.\n7. Regularly monitor symptoms and adjust treatment plans accordingly, with a focus on safety and stabilization.",
