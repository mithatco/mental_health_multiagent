Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to give us a broad overview of various areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other symptoms. The goal is to understand your experiences over the past two weeks so we can identify any concerns that might need further attention. Everything you share is confidential, and we're here to create a safe space for you. The assessment will involve me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

You mention feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, as well as pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Your sleep has been significantly disrupted by <sym>nightmares</sym>, <sym>frequent awakenings</sym>, and a sense of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You also report intrusive <sym>images</sym> of the accident, avoidance of situations that remind you of the trauma, and feelings of <sym>emotional numbness</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>. Additionally, you have shared that you have been using alcohol, tobacco, and other substances more than usual to cope with these feelings, and that you occasionally have thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym>. These symptoms suggest that the trauma has had a profound impact on your mental health and daily functioning, and I want you to know that your experiences are valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the DSM-5 criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym> such as flashbacks and distressing images related to the traumatic event, persistent <sym>avoidance</sym> of reminders, <sym>negative alterations in mood and cognition</sym> like feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and emotional numbness, and marked <sym>hyperarousal</sym> evidenced by sleep disturbances, irritability, and heightened anxiety. The presence of dissociative symptoms such as feeling disconnected from oneself, along with substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism, further supports this diagnosis. The timeline of symptoms over the past two weeks, along with their severity and impact on functioning, indicates a clinical picture consistent with <med>PTSD</med>, likely linked to the recent trauma.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Seek a comprehensive trauma-informed assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate safety, including risk of self-harm.\n2. Engage in evidence-based therapies for <med>PTSD</med>, such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n3. Consider medication management with a psychiatrist to address symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and sleep disturbances.\n4. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use, including support networks and crisis resources.\n5. Incorporate supportive interventions such as stress management, mindfulness, and grounding techniques to help manage hyperarousal and dissociation.\n6. Address substance use behaviors through counseling or referral to addiction services, as these may interfere with treatment and recovery.\n7. Regular follow-up to monitor progress, adjust treatment plans, and provide ongoing support.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, particularly exacerbated by upcoming anniversary reminders of the traumatic event. The patient reports heightened irritability, increased anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors\u2014specifically avoiding driving and media content related to accidents\u2014suggesting prominent anxiety and trauma-related avoidance symptoms. Sleep disturbances are notable, characterized by insomnia, frequent awakenings, nightmares, and non-restorative sleep, which may contribute to overall functional impairment.\n\nIntrusive symptoms are evidenced by distressing images and flashbacks, alongside intrusive memories of the accident. The patient also reports depersonalization or derealization experiences, feeling disconnected from self and surroundings, which may indicate dissociative symptoms. The presence of mood symptoms includes feelings of emotional numbness and detachment from close relationships, with social withdrawal and diminished enjoyment of previously valued activities. The patient endorses passive suicidal ideation and has engaged in maladaptive coping strategies, including increased alcohol and tobacco use, as well as non-prescribed medication use, reflecting potential self-medication attempts and heightened risk for substance use disorder.\n\nPatterns reveal significant trauma-related symptomatology consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with core features of hyperarousal, avoidance, intrusive memories, and dissociation. The patient's mood disturbance, coupled with substance use, indicates a complex clinical picture requiring comprehensive assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include trauma-related disorders (PTSD), major depressive features, anxiety disorders, dissociative symptoms, and substance misuse. The presence of suicidal thoughts warrants urgent attention to safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe trauma-related psychopathology characterized by intrusive memories, emotional numbing, dissociation, hyperarousal, avoidance behaviors, sleep disturbances, and maladaptive coping mechanisms. These symptoms suggest a need for immediate risk assessment, trauma-informed intervention, and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms related to a traumatic event. You mention feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, as well as pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. Your sleep has been significantly disrupted by <sym>nightmares</sym>, <sym>frequent awakenings</sym>, and a sense of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You also report intrusive <sym>images</sym> of the accident, avoidance of situations that remind you of the trauma, and feelings of <sym>emotional numbness</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>. Additionally, you have shared that you have been using alcohol, tobacco, and other substances more than usual to cope with these feelings, and that you occasionally have thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym>. These symptoms suggest that the trauma has had a profound impact on your mental health and daily functioning, and I want you to know that your experiences are valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the DSM-5 criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym> such as flashbacks and distressing images related to the traumatic event, persistent <sym>avoidance</sym> of reminders, <sym>negative alterations in mood and cognition</sym> like feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and emotional numbness, and marked <sym>hyperarousal</sym> evidenced by sleep disturbances, irritability, and heightened anxiety. The presence of dissociative symptoms such as feeling disconnected from oneself, along with substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism, further supports this diagnosis. The timeline of symptoms over the past two weeks, along with their severity and impact on functioning, indicates a clinical picture consistent with <med>PTSD</med>, likely linked to the recent trauma.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Seek a comprehensive trauma-informed assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate safety, including risk of self-harm.\n2. Engage in evidence-based therapies for <med>PTSD</med>, such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n3. Consider medication management with a psychiatrist to address symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and sleep disturbances.\n4. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use, including support networks and crisis resources.\n5. Incorporate supportive interventions such as stress management, mindfulness, and grounding techniques to help manage hyperarousal and dissociation.\n6. Address substance use behaviors through counseling or referral to addiction services, as these may interfere with treatment and recovery.\n7. Regular follow-up to monitor progress, adjust treatment plans, and provide ongoing support.",
