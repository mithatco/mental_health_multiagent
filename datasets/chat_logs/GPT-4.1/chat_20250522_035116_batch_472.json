This is a tool we use to get a broad understanding of different mental health symptoms you may be experiencing. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, energy, and more. I'll ask you each question and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You describe experiencing episodes of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> marked by <sym>numbness, hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty feeling pleasure in activities, alongside episodes of <sym>high energy, impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. Your sleep patterns seem to shift dramatically depending on your mood state, with very little sleep during manic phases and excessive sleeping when depressed. You also mention feelings of <sym>anxiety, irritability</sym>, and occasional <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. Despite these challenges, you appear to have insight into your experiences and are seeking understanding and support, which is a positive step towards managing your symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with mixed features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness, anhedonia, forgetfulness, and social withdrawal</sym>, as well as episodes of <sym>hypomanic features</sym> characterized by <sym>reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, increased goal-directed activity, elevated self-confidence, and racing thoughts</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> during mood shifts further support a mood disorder with significant mood instability. The episodes are episodic, and there is no evidence of psychosis or hallucinations. The pattern fits with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>, which involves hypomanic episodes and depressive episodes, often with mixed features. The patient's reports of mood swings, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances align with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other mood or anxiety disorders.\n2. Consider mood stabilizers or anticonvulsant medications as part of a pharmacological treatment plan to manage mood swings.\n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to develop coping strategies and improve insight into mood regulation.\n4. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, especially thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n5. Maintain regular sleep routines and avoid substances like alcohol or other drugs that can exacerbate mood instability.\n6.

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness consistent with depressive episodes, alongside hypomanic or manic features such as decreased need for sleep, impulsivity (e.g., risky behaviors, increased project initiation, impulsive spending), elevated self-confidence, and racing thoughts. Anxiety symptoms are present, including worry, irritability, and avoidance behaviors, with occasional reports of feeling overwhelmed or out of control. Cognitive impairments are noted during depressive states, such as forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments.\n\nPatterns suggest alternating mood states with episodic shifts between depression and hypomania/mania, evidenced by sleep disturbances, impulsivity, and fluctuating self-perception. Intrusive, distressing thoughts and feelings of dissociation or derealization further complicate the clinical picture. The patient denies psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucinations or paranoid delusions but reports transient suicidal ideation without active intent of self-harm.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder with bipolar features, particularly bipolar II or cyclothymic disorder, given the episodic nature of mood and energy changes. Anxiety symptoms and impulsivity also warrant attention, as they may impact functioning and risk management.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include impulsive behaviors during hypomanic episodes, alcohol misuse (exceeding recommended intake during episodes), and transient suicidal thoughts, although no active suicidal plans are disclosed. The patient's insight appears intact, and medication adherence is confirmed.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a pattern of mood instability characterized by episodic depressive and hypomanic symptoms, with associated cognitive, emotional, and behavioral features. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including bipolar disorder assessment and risk evaluation, is recommended to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating moods and varying levels of energy, which seem to significantly impact your daily life. You describe experiencing episodes of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> marked by <sym>numbness, hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty feeling pleasure in activities, alongside episodes of <sym>high energy, impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. Your sleep patterns seem to shift dramatically depending on your mood state, with very little sleep during manic phases and excessive sleeping when depressed. You also mention feelings of <sym>anxiety, irritability</sym>, and occasional <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. Despite these challenges, you appear to have insight into your experiences and are seeking understanding and support, which is a positive step towards managing your symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with mixed features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness, anhedonia, forgetfulness, and social withdrawal</sym>, as well as episodes of <sym>hypomanic features</sym> characterized by <sym>reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, increased goal-directed activity, elevated self-confidence, and racing thoughts</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> during mood shifts further support a mood disorder with significant mood instability. The episodes are episodic, and there is no evidence of psychosis or hallucinations. The pattern fits with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>, which involves hypomanic episodes and depressive episodes, often with mixed features. The patient's reports of mood swings, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances align with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other mood or anxiety disorders.\n2. Consider mood stabilizers or anticonvulsant medications as part of a pharmacological treatment plan to manage mood swings.\n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to develop coping strategies and improve insight into mood regulation.\n4. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, especially thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n5. Maintain regular sleep routines and avoid substances like alcohol or other drugs that can exacerbate mood instability.\n6. Collaborate with a healthcare provider to create an ongoing treatment plan tailored to your needs.",
