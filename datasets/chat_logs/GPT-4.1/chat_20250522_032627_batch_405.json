Additionally, your reports of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and <sym>desire to escape</sym> indicate you are facing considerable emotional pain, and your use of alcohol and tobacco might be an attempt to cope.

Conduct a detailed safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicide, and establish immediate safety plans if needed.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, possibly including screening for dissociative symptoms and other comorbidities.\n3. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), under medical supervision.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address obsessive-compulsive behaviors, manage anxiety, and develop coping strategies for mood symptoms.\n5. Consider trauma-informed therapy if dissociative or trauma-related symptoms are prominent.\n6. Address substance use behaviors by providing psychoeducation and exploring healthier coping strategies.\n7.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Summary:\n\nThe patient exhibits pervasive symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including persistent anhedonia, feelings of depression, hopelessness, and anhedonia over the past two weeks. There is notable irritability and anger, alongside reports of fatigue and disrupted sleep characterized by frequent awakenings and non-restorative rest. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of chronic worry, heightened arousal, and episodic panic attacks involving physiologic symptoms such as tachycardia and dyspnea. The patient demonstrates avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, particularly crowded or triggering environments, suggestive of possible social or obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nCognitive and perceptual concerns include recent memory difficulties, dissociative experiences such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, and a sense of identity confusion. Intrusive, repetitive thoughts about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors like excessive hand washing and checking, point toward obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle pains appear stress-related. The patient reports feelings of frustration and being misunderstood, with emotional withdrawal from social relationships. There are also indications of maladaptive coping strategies, including alcohol use to manage anxiety symptoms and occasional tobacco use.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts,\" desire for everything to stop), episodic panic attacks, and self-reported dissociative experiences. The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsions, combined with mood and anxiety symptoms, warrant careful assessment for underlying mood and anxiety disorders, as well as potential comorbid obsessive-compulsive features. The patient's social withdrawal, feelings of disconnection, and substance use further contribute to clinical concern.\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests a complex, multidimensional affective and anxiety disorder with obsessive-compulsive features, alongside significant distress and potential risk for self-harm. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to delineate diagnosis, assess safety, and inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing and complex array of experiences. It\u2019s evident that you are struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym> that feels constant and overwhelming, and intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> that are difficult to manage. Your descriptions of feeling <sym>detached from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym>, suggest significant internal distress. You\u2019re also experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> such as forgetfulness, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> like excessive hand washing and checking. Additionally, your reports of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and <sym>desire to escape</sym> indicate you are facing considerable emotional pain, and your use of alcohol and tobacco might be an attempt to cope. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed given these interconnected challenges, and seeking help is a positive step toward understanding and managing these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with Obsessive-Compulsive and Anxiety Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>persistent low mood</sym> over at least the past two weeks, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, including <sym>constant worry</sym>, episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, further supports an anxiety component. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, coupled with <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> like excessive washing and checking, suggests co-occurring <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms, such as feeling <sym>detached from oneself and surroundings</sym>, and memory difficulties may reflect severe distress or comorbid dissociative features. The combination of mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms indicates a complex presentation that warrants integrated treatment. The <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and self-harm ideation highlight the importance of immediate safety assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicide, and establish immediate safety plans if needed.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, possibly including screening for dissociative symptoms and other comorbidities.\n3. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), under medical supervision.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address obsessive-compulsive behaviors, manage anxiety, and develop coping strategies for mood symptoms.\n5. Consider trauma-informed therapy if dissociative or trauma-related symptoms are prominent.\n6. Address substance use behaviors by providing psychoeducation and exploring healthier coping strategies.\n7. Regularly monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",
