Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, tailored to the patient\u2019s symptoms and preferences.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive thoughts, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor for any signs of increased suicidality or worsening symptoms, and establish safety plans if needed.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication to improve sleep quality.  \n6. Consider cognitive assessment and support for memory difficulties, and explore possible underlying neurological or medical causes if symptoms persist.",

They report significant sleep disturbance, notably early-morning awakening and non-restorative sleep, alongside cognitive concerns including recent memory impairment and disorientation in familiar environments. Intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts are noted, with some evidence of passive suicidal ideation without current plans or intent. Anxiety features are evident, including heightened worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors related to social situations, suggestive of comorbid anxiety symptoms. The patient also describes depersonalization experiences, feelings of emotional detachment, and social withdrawal, indicating possible dissociative features or core depressive cognition.\n\nPatterns indicate a predominant depressive symptomatology with associated anxiety, sleep disruption, cognitive difficulties, and social isolation. There are no reported psychotic symptoms, substance use, or expressive manic behaviors. The patient denies current suicidal plans but acknowledges passive death wishes, necessitating ongoing risk assessment.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features, cognitive impairment, and dissociative symptoms. The presence of intrusive thoughts warrants monitoring for suicidality. Absence of substance misuse or psychosis reduces immediate risk factors but does not eliminate the need for close follow-up.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation of mood, cognitive, and anxiety symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depression, compounded by dissociative experiences and sleep disturbance, warranting comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing persistent </sym>low mood</sym>, </sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of </sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also reported significant </sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, waking early and feeling tired despite less sleep. Cognitive concerns include </sym>memory difficulties</sym> and feeling </sym>disoriented in familiar places</sym>. You mentioned experiencing </sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and occasional </sym>passive thoughts of death</sym>, though without any plans or intentions. Additionally, you described </sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as worry, hypervigilance, and </sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. You also noted feelings of </sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with </sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant depressive state intertwined with anxiety features and some dissociative experiences, impacting your sleep, cognition, and social connections. Your openness about these feelings is important, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a difficult time that warrants compassionate support and appropriate intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, moderate to severe, with anxious features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent </sym>depressed mood</sym>, </sym>anhedonia</sym>, and </sym>hopelessness</sym>, alongside sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments such as </sym>memory issues</sym> and </sym>dissociative experiences</sym>. The presence of </sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and </sym>passive death wishes</sym> further supports a depressive episode. The reported </sym>worry</sym>, </sym>avoidance</sym>, and </sym>hypervigilance</sym> indicate comorbid </med>anxiety</med> features. There are no signs of psychosis or mania, and substance use is absent. The combination of mood, cognitive, and anxiety symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious features, especially given the severity and impact on functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, tailored to the patient\u2019s symptoms and preferences.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive thoughts, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor for any signs of increased suicidality or worsening symptoms, and establish safety plans if needed.  \n5. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication to improve sleep quality.  \n6. Consider cognitive assessment and support for memory difficulties, and explore possible underlying neurological or medical causes if symptoms persist.",
