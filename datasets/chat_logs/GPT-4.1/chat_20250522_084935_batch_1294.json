We will be going through a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Your responses are confidential, and our goal is to understand how you've been feeling and functioning recently so we can better support you. The process involves asking you 23 questions one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as you can. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a complex pattern of mood and behavioral experiences. It sounds like you go through significant fluctuations, including periods of deep depressive feelings characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and fatigue, along with episodes of elevated energy, irritability, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors. You also mention episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> during stressful times, as well as social withdrawal during low periods. While you experience some anxiety and stress, you have not reported hallucinations, delusions, or persistent psychosis. It appears your mood symptoms are episodic, with some symptom overlap across different mood states, which suggests a mood disorder that involves both depressive and hypomanic/manic features. Your history indicates a need for careful monitoring to understand the pattern and severity of these episodes, as well as support for managing fluctuating moods and associated symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, current episode mixed or hypomanic with depressive features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports include <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue, as well as <sym>hypomanic or manic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, impulsivity, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and irritability. The episodic nature of mood swings, the presence of both depressive and elevated symptoms, and the absence of psychotic features support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient's experiences of dissociation and intrusive thoughts may be related to stress or comorbid anxiety but do not currently indicate <med>psychosis</med>. The pattern of symptoms is consistent with a mood disorder involving mood episodes that are distinct and episodic, aligning with bipolar spectrum diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of mood episodes, and evaluate risk factors such as suicidality or substance use.  \n2. Consider initiating or adjusting mood stabilization medication, such as a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or psychoeducation, focusing on mood regulation, coping strategies, and understanding illness patterns.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and develop a sleep hygiene plan, as sleep disturbances are prominent and can trigger mood episodes.  \n5. Establish a safety plan to address any thoughts of self-harm, especially during depressive episodes, and provide crisis resources if needed.",

These episodic mood fluctuations suggest a pattern consistent with bipolar disorder, with distinct depressive and manic/hypomanic phases.\n\nNotable symptoms include:\n- Depressive features: anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, sleep disturbances (hypersomnia during lows), cognitive impairments (memory issues), and social withdrawal.\n- Manic/hypomanic features: elevated energy, decreased sleep, impulsivity, risky behaviors, irritability, and increased activity levels.\n- Anxiety symptoms: occasional nervousness, difficulty relaxing, and avoidance behaviors during low or anxious states.\n- Dissociative experiences: episodes of depersonalization or derealization during stressful periods.\n- Intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors during high phases, though currently not persistent.\n- No current psychotic symptoms or perceptual disturbances; no current suicidal ideation with intent noted, though past feelings of overwhelm are acknowledged.\n\nPatterns indicate mood episodes are punctuated by periods of increased activity and irritability, with concurrent depressive symptoms. Sleep patterns are variable, with hypersomnia during depressive phases and reduced sleep during manic episodes. Substance use appears limited to occasional alcohol consumption and smoking, without evidence of problematic or addictive patterns. No current misuse of prescribed medications or illegal substances.\n\nRisk factors/warning signs include:\n- Past suicidal ideation during depressive episodes.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors during hypomanic/manic states.\n- Social withdrawal during depressive episodes.\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociative episodes, which may indicate distress or dissociative tendencies.\n\nClinically, the presentation warrants close monitoring for mood episode severity and frequency, assessment of suicidality risk, and evaluation of functional impairment. The patient's history suggests bipolar disorder with current mood instability and comorbid anxiety symptoms, necessitating comprehensive mood stabilization and possible psychotherapy interventions.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex pattern of mood and behavioral experiences. It sounds like you go through significant fluctuations, including periods of deep depressive feelings characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and fatigue, along with episodes of elevated energy, irritability, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors. You also mention episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> during stressful times, as well as social withdrawal during low periods. While you experience some anxiety and stress, you have not reported hallucinations, delusions, or persistent psychosis. It appears your mood symptoms are episodic, with some symptom overlap across different mood states, which suggests a mood disorder that involves both depressive and hypomanic/manic features. Your history indicates a need for careful monitoring to understand the pattern and severity of these episodes, as well as support for managing fluctuating moods and associated symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, current episode mixed or hypomanic with depressive features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports include <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue, as well as <sym>hypomanic or manic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, impulsivity, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and irritability. The episodic nature of mood swings, the presence of both depressive and elevated symptoms, and the absence of psychotic features support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient's experiences of dissociation and intrusive thoughts may be related to stress or comorbid anxiety but do not currently indicate <med>psychosis</med>. The pattern of symptoms is consistent with a mood disorder involving mood episodes that are distinct and episodic, aligning with bipolar spectrum diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of mood episodes, and evaluate risk factors such as suicidality or substance use.  \n2. Consider initiating or adjusting mood stabilization medication, such as a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or psychoeducation, focusing on mood regulation, coping strategies, and understanding illness patterns.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and develop a sleep hygiene plan, as sleep disturbances are prominent and can trigger mood episodes.  \n5. Establish a safety plan to address any thoughts of self-harm, especially during depressive episodes, and provide crisis resources if needed.",
