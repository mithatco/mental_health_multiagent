Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of mental health. The purpose of this assessment is to get a better understanding of your current emotional and psychological state, so we can figure out the best way to support you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

Your pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggest a heightened state of arousal and distress. You also describe difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, including nightmares and frequent awakenings, along with somatic symptoms like headaches and muscle tension. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> further indicate trauma-related symptoms. Additionally, your increased use of <sym>alcohol</sym>, <sym>tobacco</sym>, and <sym>medications</sym> as coping mechanisms, combined with social withdrawal, highlight the severity of your current struggles and potential risk factors for worsening mental health. I want to acknowledge how overwhelming this must feel and that seeking help is a courageous step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the traumatic event (Q17), <sym>nightmares</sym> and sleep disturbance (Q15), <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (Q7), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9). Dissociative features, such as feeling <sym>detached</sym> (Q19) and identity confusion (Q20), are also present, aligning with trauma-related dissociation. The persistent <sym>low mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The increased <sym>substance use</sym> (Q22, Q23, Q24) indicates maladaptive coping, which can exacerbate psychological symptoms and pose safety concerns. The overall clinical picture points to a complex trauma response with mood and behavioral components, requiring a careful and comprehensive approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacotherapy, including SSRIs, to help manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.  \n3. Develop a safety plan to reduce substance use and monitor for any risk of self-harm or worsening mental health.  \n4. Encourage engagement in supportive therapy or group support to reduce social withdrawal and foster connection.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness or grounding exercises, to help reduce hyperarousal.",

Anxiety-related symptoms are also evident, notably pervasive nervousness, hypervigilance (Q7), panic attacks (Q8), and avoidance behaviors, particularly related to driving and trauma triggers (Q9). The patient reports significant sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia, nightmares, and difficulty achieving restful sleep (Q5, Q15), compounded by somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension (Q10). Cognitive concerns include memory impairment and disorientation (Q16), alongside intrusive distressing images related to a traumatic event (Q17), suggestive of trauma-related symptomatology.\n\nThe patient exhibits behavioral indicators of maladaptive coping mechanisms, including increased alcohol consumption (Q22), tobacco use (Q23), and unsupervised intake of medications (Q24). There are noted feelings of emotional detachment or derealization (Q19), as well as a sense of identity confusion and anhedonia in interpersonal relationships, leading to social withdrawal (Q20, Q21). The patient's response to the trauma appears central, with ongoing distress linked to the recent accident, which exacerbates hyperarousal and avoidance.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), comorbid substance use, and risk of self-harm or deterioration due to maladaptive coping strategies. Although explicit suicidal ideation or intent was not reported, the use of substances to manage distress warrants ongoing assessment for potential risk.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood disturbance, trauma-related symptoms, hyperarousal, avoidance, dissociative features, and substance misuse, indicating a need for comprehensive, trauma-informed intervention and close monitoring of safety.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences that reflect significant emotional, psychological, and behavioral challenges. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with intense feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, especially related to the recent trauma of the accident. Your pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggest a heightened state of arousal and distress. You also describe difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, including nightmares and frequent awakenings, along with somatic symptoms like headaches and muscle tension. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> further indicate trauma-related symptoms. Additionally, your increased use of <sym>alcohol</sym>, <sym>tobacco</sym>, and <sym>medications</sym> as coping mechanisms, combined with social withdrawal, highlight the severity of your current struggles and potential risk factors for worsening mental health. I want to acknowledge how overwhelming this must feel and that seeking help is a courageous step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits core symptoms of <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the traumatic event (Q17), <sym>nightmares</sym> and sleep disturbance (Q15), <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (Q7), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9). Dissociative features, such as feeling <sym>detached</sym> (Q19) and identity confusion (Q20), are also present, aligning with trauma-related dissociation. The persistent <sym>low mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The increased <sym>substance use</sym> (Q22, Q23, Q24) indicates maladaptive coping, which can exacerbate psychological symptoms and pose safety concerns. The overall clinical picture points to a complex trauma response with mood and behavioral components, requiring a careful and comprehensive approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacotherapy, including SSRIs, to help manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.  \n3. Develop a safety plan to reduce substance use and monitor for any risk of self-harm or worsening mental health.  \n4. Encourage engagement in supportive therapy or group support to reduce social withdrawal and foster connection.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness or grounding exercises, to help reduce hyperarousal.",
