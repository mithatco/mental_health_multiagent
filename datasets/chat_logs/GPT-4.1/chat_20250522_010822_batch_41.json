This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, psychosis, and more. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express your experiences openly. The assessment consists of 23 questions that cover different areas of mental health over the past two weeks. I will ask you each question one by one, and you can respond honestly and in your own words. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You're experiencing <sym>persistent irritability and irritability</sym> that affects your interactions, along with <sym>sleep disturbances, including insomnia and feeling unrested</sym>. You also report <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>hearing voices commenting or conversing with you</sym>, which can be very frightening and isolating. Additionally, you describe <sym>feelings of detachment, derealization, and depersonalization</sym>, along with <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>disturbing recurring thoughts or images</sym>. Your anxiety manifests as <sym>constant worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym>. You also mention <sym>unexplained physical aches and pains</sym>. Your use of substances and medications, sometimes beyond prescribed amounts, may also influence your overall mental health. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are overwhelming and deeply impact your well-being, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>active thoughts of self-harm</sym>, indicating a severe mood disorder. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations involving voices commenting and conversing</sym>, along with <sym>delusional experiences such as thought broadcasting and derealization</sym>, suggests concomitant <med>psychotic features</med>. The symptoms have persisted for at least two weeks, with significant impairment, aligning with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The dissociative phenomena and hallucinations are consistent with psychosis that may be secondary to mood disorder or indicative of a primary psychotic disorder, but given the current symptom constellation, a mood disorder with psychotic features is the most fitting provisional diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints further complicate the presentation, but they are likely secondary to the primary mood and psychotic symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek urgent psychiatric evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan, including pharmacotherapy with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood symptoms, psychotic experiences, and underlying stressors.  \n4. Conduct further assessments, including medical evaluations to rule out any physical causes for somatic symptoms and neuroimaging if indicated.  \n5. Establish a strong support system and consider involvement of family or close friends for additional support and monitoring.",

Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia, depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent irritability, suggestive of a major depressive episode. The patient reports recurrent thoughts of self-harm and experiences auditory hallucinations involving voices commenting and conversing, indicating active psychotic features. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of generalized worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, consistent with an anxiety disorder, potentially comorbid with panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nThe patient also reports cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including memory impairment, derealization, depersonalization, and thought broadcasting, which are indicative of dissociative phenomena or psychosis. Somatic complaints, such as unexplained headaches and body aches, accompany sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep, further exacerbating emotional dysregulation.\n\nPatterns observed include persistent mood symptoms, psychotic experiences, dissociative symptoms, and anxiety features, often co-occurring and intensifying during periods of increased distress. Substance use appears present but not excessive; however, recent medication misuse and prior recreational drug use are noted as potential contributing factors.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include active suicidal ideation, auditory hallucinations, perceptual disturbances, and dissociative episodes, all of which necessitate immediate clinical attention. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished capacity for close relationships highlight social isolation, potentially worsening mental health prognosis.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe mood disturbance with psychotic and dissociative features, significant anxiety symptoms, and somatic complaints, compounded by substance use and sleep disruption. These findings suggest a complex, comorbid psychiatric presentation requiring comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and integrated intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You appear to be experiencing a complex and distressing combination of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You\u2019ve shared that you feel <sym>little interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, often feeling <sym>depressed, hopeless, and hopelessness</sym>. You're experiencing <sym>persistent irritability and irritability</sym> that affects your interactions, along with <sym>sleep disturbances, including insomnia and feeling unrested</sym>. You also report <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>hearing voices commenting or conversing with you</sym>, which can be very frightening and isolating. Additionally, you describe <sym>feelings of detachment, derealization, and depersonalization</sym>, along with <sym>memory issues</sym> and <sym>disturbing recurring thoughts or images</sym>. Your anxiety manifests as <sym>constant worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym>. You also mention <sym>unexplained physical aches and pains</sym>. Your use of substances and medications, sometimes beyond prescribed amounts, may also influence your overall mental health. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are overwhelming and deeply impact your well-being, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>active thoughts of self-harm</sym>, indicating a severe mood disorder. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations involving voices commenting and conversing</sym>, along with <sym>delusional experiences such as thought broadcasting and derealization</sym>, suggests concomitant <med>psychotic features</med>. The symptoms have persisted for at least two weeks, with significant impairment, aligning with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The dissociative phenomena and hallucinations are consistent with psychosis that may be secondary to mood disorder or indicative of a primary psychotic disorder, but given the current symptom constellation, a mood disorder with psychotic features is the most fitting provisional diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints further complicate the presentation, but they are likely secondary to the primary mood and psychotic symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek urgent psychiatric evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan, including pharmacotherapy with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address mood symptoms, psychotic experiences, and underlying stressors.  \n4. Conduct further assessments, including medical evaluations to rule out any physical causes for somatic symptoms and neuroimaging if indicated.  \n5. Establish a strong support system and consider involvement of family or close friends for additional support and monitoring.",
