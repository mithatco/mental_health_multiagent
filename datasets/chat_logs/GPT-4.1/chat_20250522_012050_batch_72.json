Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, thoughts, and behaviors. Please know that everything we discuss is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various domains, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer honestly and openly, and if anything feels uncomfortable or unclear, just let me know. Are you ready to get started?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant psychopathology affecting multiple domains. Key features include pervasive anhedonia and depressive symptoms characterized by feelings of hopelessness, emotional numbness, and a sense of emptiness. There are prominent psychotic features, notably auditory hallucinations (hearing voices commenting, arguing, and giving commands) and delusional experiences such as thought broadcasting or mind-reading, suggesting positive psychotic symptoms. The patient reports disorganized perceptual experiences, including depersonalization and derealization, along with cognitive disturbances like memory impairment and difficulty focusing, which may reflect underlying neurocognitive or affective dysregulation.\n\nAnxiety is evident, with reports of persistent worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, especially related to paranoia and auditory phenomena. Sleep disturbance is severe, characterized by insomnia, restless nights, and fatigue, which may exacerbate mood and psychotic symptoms. There is also mention of somatic complaints (headaches, tension pains) and occasional self-harm ideation, although active intent appears limited.\n\nThe patient exhibits substance use behaviors, notably cigarette smoking and episodic use of other substances, including marijuana, as well as instances of medication misuse, which may complicate clinical management and symptomatology.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of mood symptoms (depression, hopelessness) with psychotic features suggests a complex presentation, potentially indicative of a primary psychotic disorder with mood symptoms or a mood disorder with psychotic features.\n- The presence of paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and derealization points toward psychosis spectrum phenomena.\n- Anxiety and agitation are prominent, with avoidance behaviors reinforcing social withdrawal and isolation.\n- Cognitive impairments (memory issues, disorientation) necessitate further assessment.\n- Self-harm thoughts, though passive, warrant monitoring for safety.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Active auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation increase risk for distress and potential harm.\n- Self-harm ideation, even if fleeting, indicates significant emotional distress and potential suicidality.\n- Substance use and medication misuse pose risks for exacerbation of symptoms and treatment complications.\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue may impair functioning further.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a severe, multi-faceted psychopathological profile characterized by depressive, psychotic, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms. The presentation suggests the need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including differential diagnosis of primary psychotic disorders versus mood disorders with psychotic features. Immediate safety assessment regarding self-harm thoughts and substance use should be prioritized. Integrated treatment planning should address mood, psychotic symptoms, substance use, and sleep disturbances.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging experience, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to navigate these feelings and perceptions. You describe a persistent sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling detached from yourself and others, along with hearing voices and experiencing paranoid thoughts. Your sleep has been disturbed, and you sometimes have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which indicates a high level of distress. It\u2019s understandable that managing these symptoms is overwhelming, and it\u2019s important to recognize your courage in reaching out and sharing this with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, likely with comorbid mood symptoms and anxiety.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices commenting, arguing, commanding), <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> such as <quote>thoughts being broadcasted or read by others</quote>, and experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym> suggest the presence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>. The persistent <sym>depression</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> point toward a mood component, possibly a <med>major depressive disorder with psychotic features</med> or <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>. The anxiety symptoms, avoidance, and panic attacks further complicate the clinical picture. The cognitive issues, such as memory problems and disorientation, along with somatic complaints, support a complex presentation involving multiple symptom domains. Given the combination of psychotic, mood, and anxiety symptoms, a primary <med>schizophrenia spectrum disorder</med> with mood and anxiety features is a provisional impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history, mental status exam, and possibly neurocognitive testing, to clarify the diagnosis and severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate antipsychotic medication management, with close monitoring for side effects and efficacy, to address the <med>psychotic symptoms</med>.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about the symptoms and involve the patient in developing a safety plan, especially considering the <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>.  \n4. Offer supportive psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis, to help cope with hallucinations, delusions, and emotional distress.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and consider pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n6. Evaluate for substance use and medication misuse, providing education and support to reduce potential exacerbation of symptoms.  \n7. Involve a multidisciplinary team, including social work or case management, to support social functioning and address isolation.",
