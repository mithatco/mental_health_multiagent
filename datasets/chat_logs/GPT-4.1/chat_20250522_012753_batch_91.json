Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to screen for various mental health symptoms across different domains. The purpose of this assessment is to gather information about how you've been feeling and functioning recently, which can help guide any further support or treatment you might need. Please be assured that everything you share remains confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You also reported experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts, feelings of dissociation, and a sense of not knowing who you are or what you want in life</sym>. Additionally, there are concerns about <sym>substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication with prescription drugs</sym>. You expressed thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym> and feeling misunderstood by others, which are important to take seriously. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re facing multiple overlapping challenges affecting your mood, anxiety levels, cognition, and overall sense of self, and these symptoms are impacting your daily functioning and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms, Substance Use Concerns, and Possible Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> align with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>ongoing anxiety, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep problems, cognitive issues, intrusive thoughts, and dissociative feelings</sym> indicate possible dissociative or trauma-related features, although further assessment would be needed to clarify this. The self-reported <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medication use\u2014raises concern about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to or exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> emphasizes the need for immediate safety assessment and intervention. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex, overlapping clinical picture that warrants comprehensive evaluation to inform treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview and risk assessment focusing on suicidality, substance use, and dissociative symptoms.  \n2. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation, especially to address depression, anxiety, and substance use issues.  \n3. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-informed therapy, or integrated approaches to target mood, anxiety, and substance use.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of mood and anxiety disorders and the importance of safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts.  \n5. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts if appropriate and with the patient's consent.",

There is evidence of irritability and anger (Q4), and sleep disturbance characterized by reduced sleep duration yet maintained energy levels (Q5, Q15). Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent nervousness (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking social situations (Q9), suggesting social anxiety features or generalized anxiety. Intrusive and ruminative thoughts related to past mistakes (Q17), along with obsessive-like behaviors such as checking and mental reviewing (Q18), indicate possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\n\nThe patient also reports dissociative experiences (Q19), identity confusion or anhedonia regarding personal goals (Q20), and social withdrawal (Q21). Somatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle aches (Q10), and cognitive concerns such as memory difficulties (Q16). Substance use is notable, with regular cigarette smoking (Q23), alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels (Q22), and self-reported use of prescription medications outside of medical supervision (Q24), indicating potential substance use disorder and self-medication behaviors.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include suicidal ideation (Q12), with no current intent or plan explicitly stated but presence of dark thoughts indicating elevated risk, and substance misuse, which may exacerbate mental health symptoms. The patient\u2019s reports of feeling misunderstood or dismissed (Q11) may reflect feelings of invalidation or social isolation.\n\nOverall, the patient's responses suggest a complex clinical picture characterized by mood dysregulation, anxiety, dissociation, cognitive concerns, substance misuse, and suicidal ideation. These findings warrant comprehensive assessment and potential diagnostic clarification, with particular attention to suicidality, substance use, and dissociative symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of distressing experiences and symptoms that suggest you are going through a very difficult time. You mentioned persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym>, along with irritability and trouble sleeping, yet still feeling energetic when awake. Your anxiety appears to be significant, with ongoing <sym>feelings of nervousness, panic attacks, and avoidance of social situations</sym>. You also reported experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts, feelings of dissociation, and a sense of not knowing who you are or what you want in life</sym>. Additionally, there are concerns about <sym>substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication with prescription drugs</sym>. You expressed thoughts of <sym>hurting yourself</sym> and feeling misunderstood by others, which are important to take seriously. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re facing multiple overlapping challenges affecting your mood, anxiety levels, cognition, and overall sense of self, and these symptoms are impacting your daily functioning and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms, Substance Use Concerns, and Possible Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> align with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>ongoing anxiety, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep problems, cognitive issues, intrusive thoughts, and dissociative feelings</sym> indicate possible dissociative or trauma-related features, although further assessment would be needed to clarify this. The self-reported <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medication use\u2014raises concern about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to or exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> emphasizes the need for immediate safety assessment and intervention. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex, overlapping clinical picture that warrants comprehensive evaluation to inform treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview and risk assessment focusing on suicidality, substance use, and dissociative symptoms.  \n2. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation, especially to address depression, anxiety, and substance use issues.  \n3. Initiate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-informed therapy, or integrated approaches to target mood, anxiety, and substance use.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of mood and anxiety disorders and the importance of safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts.  \n5. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts if appropriate and with the patient's consent.",
