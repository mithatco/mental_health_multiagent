We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool that helps us get an overall picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space where you can share your experiences honestly. The questions cover various areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more, totaling 23 questions. We will go through each one one at a time. Are you ready for me to start with the first question?"

You described persistent feelings of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and frequent <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about yourself. You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty sleeping, with disrupted sleep patterns and ongoing fatigue. Additionally, you've reported <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with episodes of feeling lost and disconnected from your identity. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are also present, which seem to be linked to your overall tension and stress. Anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of crowded places</sym>, are evident. You mentioned experiencing <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> but clarified there is no active intent or plan. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, which appear interconnected and impactful on your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>negative self-perception</sym>, fulfilling core criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> further support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, including <sym>feeling detached from oneself and surroundings</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, suggest dissociative features often seen in severe mood or trauma-related conditions. The physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>gastrointestinal discomfort</sym> may reflect somatic manifestations associated with depression and anxiety, but they do not appear to meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> since they are better explained by emotional distress. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although fleeting, warrants careful monitoring but does not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist to confirm diagnosis and consider pharmacologic treatment options such as antidepressants.  \n2. Refer for psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and dissociative experiences.  \n3. Conduct a safety assessment and develop a safety plan to monitor and manage any risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts.  \n4. Explore potential medical evaluations for somatic symptoms to rule out underlying medical conditions if symptoms persist or worsen.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and develop routines to improve sleep quality.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and anhedonic affect, persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and non-restorative rest despite increased sleep duration, coupled with fatigue and decreased motivation. Cognitive concerns are evident through reported memory impairments and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient reports recurrent negative intrusive thoughts and feelings of emotional detachment, suggestive of dissociative symptoms. Anxiety manifests as heightened worry, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors, particularly of crowded settings. Somatic complaints, including headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort, may reflect somatization or heightened physiological tension. The patient admits to fleeting thoughts of self-harm but denies active suicidal intent or plan. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions is noted. Substance use appears minimal, with no current misuse reported.\n\nPattern analysis reveals symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, possibly comorbid with an anxiety disorder, and features of dissociative experiences. The presence of hopelessness, anhedonia, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation are clinically significant and warrant close monitoring. The dissociative symptoms, such as feeling detached from oneself and identity confusion, further inform the clinical picture. No immediate risk of self-harm is identified, but ongoing assessment of suicidal and self-injurious thoughts is advised.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a severe mood disorder with associated anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative features, requiring comprehensive evaluation and intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that have significantly affected your emotional well-being and daily functioning. You described persistent feelings of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and frequent <sym>negative thoughts</sym> about yourself. You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty sleeping, with disrupted sleep patterns and ongoing fatigue. Additionally, you've reported <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with episodes of feeling lost and disconnected from your identity. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are also present, which seem to be linked to your overall tension and stress. Anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of crowded places</sym>, are evident. You mentioned experiencing <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> but clarified there is no active intent or plan. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, which appear interconnected and impactful on your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>negative self-perception</sym>, fulfilling core criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> further support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, including <sym>feeling detached from oneself and surroundings</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, suggest dissociative features often seen in severe mood or trauma-related conditions. The physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>gastrointestinal discomfort</sym> may reflect somatic manifestations associated with depression and anxiety, but they do not appear to meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> since they are better explained by emotional distress. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although fleeting, warrants careful monitoring but does not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation with a psychiatrist to confirm diagnosis and consider pharmacologic treatment options such as antidepressants.  \n2. Refer for psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and dissociative experiences.  \n3. Conduct a safety assessment and develop a safety plan to monitor and manage any risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts.  \n4. Explore potential medical evaluations for somatic symptoms to rule out underlying medical conditions if symptoms persist or worsen.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and develop routines to improve sleep quality.",
