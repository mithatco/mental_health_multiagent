We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, energy, and others. I'll be asking you each question, and you can answer in your own words, describing how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The presence of increased irritability and difficulty with sleep\u2014specifically hypersomnia and non-restorative sleep\u2014further supports this assessment. The report of physical complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, despite medical reassurance, suggests somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nAnxiety features are evident, with reports of heightened worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments, indicating significant anxiety or social avoidance. The patient also reports intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts and feelings of emotional dissociation or derealization, suggesting possible dissociative symptoms or depersonalization experiences. Notably, there are passive suicidal thoughts expressed, which represent a potential risk factor requiring careful monitoring.\n\nCognitive concerns include increased forgetfulness, which may be related to concentration difficulties associated with depression or anxiety. The patient denies psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucinations or thought broadcasting, and reports no recent substance use or risky behaviors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Major depressive symptoms with associated psychomotor and cognitive disturbances\n- Significant anxiety and avoidance behaviors\n- Dissociative or depersonalization experiences\n- Passive suicidal ideation\n- Somatic complaints with no evident medical etiology\n\nRisk factors and warning signs:\n- Passive suicidal thoughts warrant safety assessment and ongoing monitoring\n- Elevated anxiety and social avoidance could impair functioning\n- Symptoms of emotional numbness and dissociation suggest severity and possible comorbid dissociative features\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a constellation of depressive and anxious symptoms, including mood disturbance, anhedonia, social withdrawal, intrusive negative thoughts, dissociative experiences, and passive suicidal ideation. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive clinical evaluation, risk assessment, and formulation of an appropriate treatment plan targeting mood, anxiety, and safety.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a lot about how you've been feeling lately, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very difficult time. You\u2019re experiencing persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You\u2019ve also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014both sleeping more and having trouble sleeping at all. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> are also present, despite medical reassurance. Anxiety is evident in your feelings of <sym>worry</sym> and being <sym>on edge</sym>, and you've been avoiding certain situations due to this. You\u2019ve also experienced <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>, feeling disconnected from yourself. Importantly, you\u2019ve expressed <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about self-harm, which is a significant concern that needs careful attention. Overall, your symptoms point to a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, with some risk factors that require ongoing safety monitoring.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests significant <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>derealization</sym> and feeling disconnected from oneself point to dissociative features, possibly indicating <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the importance of safety assessment. The physical complaints, although common in depression, also warrant ongoing medical evaluation to rule out somatic causes. Overall, the combination of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and suicidal thoughts supports this clinical impression, with the need for comprehensive treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or adjust appropriate <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and dissociative symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, tailored to the patient's symptoms and preferences.\n4. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.\n5. Recommend medical evaluation for persistent physical symptoms to rule out other medical conditions and ensure comprehensive care.",
