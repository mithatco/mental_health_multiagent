This assessment is designed to get a broad understanding of different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a helpful tool to identify any symptoms that might need further attention, and everything you share will be kept confidential. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I encourage you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Additionally, you mention <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> during depressive states, some <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness, and <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors that appear to be linked to mood episodes. It sounds like you're going through a very challenging time with significant mood swings and associated symptoms that impact your daily functioning and relationships. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences, which helps in understanding what you're facing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode mixed, moderate severity with current depressive features and historical manic episodes</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling hopeless, disinterested in hobbies</quote>, <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>) alongside periods of <sym>elevated or irritable mood</sym>, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep, and risk-taking behaviors are characteristic of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>cognitive disturbances</sym> further support this diagnosis. The episodic nature, with clear mood swings between depressive and manic states, aligns with bipolar spectrum disorders, particularly <med>Bipolar I</med>. The patient's substance use during mood episodes and withdrawal from social relationships are common comorbid features. No psychotic features are reported, but the mood instability is prominent and warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity, safety, and comorbid conditions.  \n2. Develop a mood stabilization treatment plan, potentially including medication such as mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) or atypical antipsychotics.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, including triggers, symptom management, and the importance of medication adherence.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy options such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) to help manage mood swings and improve social functioning.  \n5. Address substance use behaviors with integrated treatment or referral to addiction specialists if needed.  \n6. Establish a safety plan to monitor and manage thoughts of self-harm, ensuring support is available during mood episodes.",

Key symptoms include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal. During manic episodes, the patient reports increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, elevated energy with markedly decreased sleep, and risk-taking behaviors such as impulsive spending. Anxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of being on edge, social avoidance, and occasional panic-like feelings. Cognitive concerns include occasional memory impairment and episodes of derealization or depersonalization, particularly during mood swings. Intrusive thoughts are noted during depressive states, though no evidence of psychosis or hallucinations is reported. Substance use behaviors include episodic alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits during mood episodes and regular cigarette smoking, with some misuse of sleep medication.\n\nPatterns observed indicate significant mood dysregulation, with alternating depressive and manic symptoms, suggestive of bipolar spectrum disorder. The patient's social functioning appears compromised, with withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships. Risk factors include impulsivity during manic phases, substance misuse, and passive suicidal ideation without current intent or planning. No immediate psychotic symptoms are evident, but the presence of mood instability and substance use warrants careful monitoring.\n\nOverall, findings highlight the need for comprehensive assessment of mood disorder, potential bipolar diagnosis, and evaluation of risk factors for self-harm. Further clinical evaluation should focus on mood stability, substance use, safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts, and functional impairment.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating mood states, including episodes of <sym>depression</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal. You also describe periods of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and <sym>impulsivity</sym> during what seem to be manic episodes, along with symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and avoiding social situations. Additionally, you mention <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> during depressive states, some <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness, and <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors that appear to be linked to mood episodes. It sounds like you're going through a very challenging time with significant mood swings and associated symptoms that impact your daily functioning and relationships. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences, which helps in understanding what you're facing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode mixed, moderate severity with current depressive features and historical manic episodes</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling hopeless, disinterested in hobbies</quote>, <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>) alongside periods of <sym>elevated or irritable mood</sym>, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep, and risk-taking behaviors are characteristic of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>cognitive disturbances</sym> further support this diagnosis. The episodic nature, with clear mood swings between depressive and manic states, aligns with bipolar spectrum disorders, particularly <med>Bipolar I</med>. The patient's substance use during mood episodes and withdrawal from social relationships are common comorbid features. No psychotic features are reported, but the mood instability is prominent and warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity, safety, and comorbid conditions.  \n2. Develop a mood stabilization treatment plan, potentially including medication such as mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) or atypical antipsychotics.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, including triggers, symptom management, and the importance of medication adherence.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy options such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) to help manage mood swings and improve social functioning.  \n5. Address substance use behaviors with integrated treatment or referral to addiction specialists if needed.  \n6. Establish a safety plan to monitor and manage thoughts of self-harm, ensuring support is available during mood episodes.",
