Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a tool we use to get an overall picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer honestly and feel free to share as much or as little as you are comfortable with. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also described <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about your identity and purpose</sym>, which can be very unsettling. Your sleep difficulties, physical discomfort, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the level of distress you\u2019re facing. I want to acknowledge how brave it is to share these experiences and to seek support, and I am here to help you find ways to navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks, physical symptoms of panic, and avoidance of situations due to fear</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Additionally, descriptions of <sym>feeling disconnected from oneself and reality, such as derealization and depersonalization</sym>, indicate dissociative experiences that may be associated with trauma or severe anxiety. The combination of these symptoms points to a complex clinical presentation requiring integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess severity, and rule out other possible conditions.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, including crisis resources and support networks.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, focusing on addressing negative thought patterns and panic management.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), as part of an integrated treatment plan, with close monitoring for efficacy and side effects.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if appropriate.  \n6. Explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms are linked to past trauma, potentially involving trauma-focused therapies.  \n7. Encourage gradual social re-engagement and activities that promote connection and purpose, as tolerated.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment, and provide ongoing support.",

The co-occurrence of mood and anxiety symptoms, coupled with passive suicidal ideation, underscores the need for comprehensive risk assessment and targeted intervention. Further evaluation should explore the severity and duration of dissociative symptoms, the presence of trauma history, and the patient's safety needs.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing picture of your current mental health struggles. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing a combination of <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and anhedonia</sym>, along with significant <sym>anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym>. You also described <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about your identity and purpose</sym>, which can be very unsettling. Your sleep difficulties, physical discomfort, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the level of distress you\u2019re facing. I want to acknowledge how brave it is to share these experiences and to seek support, and I am here to help you find ways to navigate through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks, physical symptoms of panic, and avoidance of situations due to fear</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Additionally, descriptions of <sym>feeling disconnected from oneself and reality, such as derealization and depersonalization</sym>, indicate dissociative experiences that may be associated with trauma or severe anxiety. The combination of these symptoms points to a complex clinical presentation requiring integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Schedule a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess severity, and rule out other possible conditions.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, including crisis resources and support networks.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, focusing on addressing negative thought patterns and panic management.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), as part of an integrated treatment plan, with close monitoring for efficacy and side effects.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if appropriate.  \n6. Explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms are linked to past trauma, potentially involving trauma-focused therapies.  \n7. Encourage gradual social re-engagement and activities that promote connection and purpose, as tolerated.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, adjust treatment, and provide ongoing support.",
