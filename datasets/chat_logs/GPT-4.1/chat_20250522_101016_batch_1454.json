Today, I'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time.

You\u2019ve also described ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are causing significant distress, along with avoidance behaviors and sleep difficulties. You mention feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>confusion</sym> about yourself, which seem to be adding to your sense of being overwhelmed and lost. Your experiences appear to be impacting multiple areas of your life, including your relationships, daily functioning, and overall well-being. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are difficult to manage, and reaching out for help is a positive step toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Features> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient reports a persistent <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, including early awakenings and fragmented sleep, alongside cognitive issues like memory problems and feelings of <sym>derealization</sym>, further support a depressive and anxiety-related clinical picture. The avoidance behaviors and distressing intrusive thoughts reinforce the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder with panic features. There are no indications of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse, which helps narrow the focus to mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including standardized questionnaires and possibly sleep studies, to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.<br>\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, along with psychoeducation about panic attacks and coping strategies.<br>\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, to target depressive and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects and treatment response.<br>\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if necessary, short-term medication management.<br>\n5. Explore additional support options, such as support groups or referral to a psychiatrist or sleep specialist, if symptoms persist or worsen.",

They report persistent anxiety, characterized by chronic worry, hypervigilance, and recurrent panic attacks, with associated avoidance behaviors such as social withdrawal and avoidance of crowded or public places. Sleep disturbances are evident, including early awakenings and fragmented sleep, leading to daytime exhaustion. Cognitive concerns include memory lapses and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient experiences intrusive, recurrent distressing thoughts related to panic attacks and feelings of depersonalization or derealization during heightened anxiety episodes.\n\nPatterns in responses suggest comorbid depressive and anxiety features, with notable panic symptoms and avoidance behaviors. There is no evidence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse or abuse. The patient reports no recent self-harm thoughts or behaviors and denies hallucinations or paranoid ideation.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include moderate to severe anxiety disorder with panic features, co-occurring depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairments. The patient's social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors warrant attention, as do the intrusive thoughts and depersonalization experiences.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs are limited; however, the severity of panic attacks and persistent anxiety require close monitoring. No immediate suicidal or homicidal ideation is evident.\n\nOverall, the assessment indicates a complex presentation of mood and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment and distress, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your current emotional and physical experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>lack of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. You\u2019ve also described ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are causing significant distress, along with avoidance behaviors and sleep difficulties. You mention feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>confusion</sym> about yourself, which seem to be adding to your sense of being overwhelmed and lost. Your experiences appear to be impacting multiple areas of your life, including your relationships, daily functioning, and overall well-being. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are difficult to manage, and reaching out for help is a positive step toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Features> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient reports a persistent <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>chronic anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, including early awakenings and fragmented sleep, alongside cognitive issues like memory problems and feelings of <sym>derealization</sym>, further support a depressive and anxiety-related clinical picture. The avoidance behaviors and distressing intrusive thoughts reinforce the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder with panic features. There are no indications of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse, which helps narrow the focus to mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including standardized questionnaires and possibly sleep studies, to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity.<br>\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, along with psychoeducation about panic attacks and coping strategies.<br>\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, to target depressive and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects and treatment response.<br>\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if necessary, short-term medication management.<br>\n5. Explore additional support options, such as support groups or referral to a psychiatrist or sleep specialist, if symptoms persist or worsen.",
