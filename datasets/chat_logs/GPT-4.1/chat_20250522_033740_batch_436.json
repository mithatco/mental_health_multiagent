This questionnaire helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering mood, anxiety, energy levels, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. I will ask you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

It sounds like you go through significant mood swings, with periods of deep sadness and hopelessness, as well as times of high energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym> during certain episodes, alongside episodes where you sleep very little and feel energized, which suggests periods of <med>mania</med> or <med>hypomania</med>. You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and physical symptoms like <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>. Additionally, you sometimes feel <sym>dissociated</sym> or <sym>detached from yourself</sym>, and have intrusive thoughts that are distressing. Despite these challenges, you do not report hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, and you seem aware of your experiences, even when overwhelmed. Your responses indicate a pattern of significant mood fluctuation, along with anxiety and some obsessive-compulsive features, which are impacting your daily functioning and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (Bipolar I or II, depending on severity and episodic features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling hopeless, losing interest</quote>, <quote>overwhelmed, sleeping excessively or very little</quote>) and <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling energized, impulsive, engaging in risky behaviors</quote>, <quote>sleeping very little but feeling fine</quote>) suggest a <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>elevated or expansive mood</sym> during episodes supports this. The mood swings are episodic rather than persistent, aligning with the diagnostic criteria for <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The coexistence of anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and intrusive thoughts does not exclude this diagnosis but indicates comorbid features that should be addressed in treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of episode duration, severity, and impact on functioning.  \n2. Consider initiating mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood fluctuations, in conjunction with psychotherapy tailored for bipolar disorder.  \n3. Implement psychoeducation about mood regulation, triggers, and warning signs of episodes to enhance self-awareness and early intervention.  \n4. Address anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences through specific therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches if relevant.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially related to <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or impulsive behaviors, and develop a safety plan as needed.",

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, indicative of depressive episodes, alongside reports of decreased sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and engagement in risky behaviors, consistent with manic or hypomanic states. The patient reports heightened irritability, anxiety, and episodes of panic, alongside somatic complaints such as unexplained aches and muscle tension, which may be associated with mood dysregulation and stress.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances appear absent, with no reports of hallucinations or paranoid ideation. However, the patient experiences dissociative symptoms such as derealization and depersonalization, especially during mood fluctuations, and reports intrusive thoughts and compulsive urges, suggesting possible comorbid obsessive-compulsive features. There are also indications of identity confusion and social withdrawal during mood episodes, impacting interpersonal functioning.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal ideation with no current intent but presence of distressing thoughts, and impulsive behaviors during hypomanic episodes, which pose potential safety concerns. The patient's responses highlight mood instability, impaired sleep patterns, and interpersonal difficulties.\n\nIn summary, the patient's symptomatology is consistent with a mood disorder characterized by alternating depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes, with associated anxiety, dissociative experiences, and compulsive phenomena. Ongoing assessment for suicidality, impulsivity, and functional impairment is warranted to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and intense experience with a wide range of emotional and physical symptoms. It sounds like you go through significant mood swings, with periods of deep sadness and hopelessness, as well as times of high energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym> during certain episodes, alongside episodes where you sleep very little and feel energized, which suggests periods of <med>mania</med> or <med>hypomania</med>. You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and physical symptoms like <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>. Additionally, you sometimes feel <sym>dissociated</sym> or <sym>detached from yourself</sym>, and have intrusive thoughts that are distressing. Despite these challenges, you do not report hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, and you seem aware of your experiences, even when overwhelmed. Your responses indicate a pattern of significant mood fluctuation, along with anxiety and some obsessive-compulsive features, which are impacting your daily functioning and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (Bipolar I or II, depending on severity and episodic features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling hopeless, losing interest</quote>, <quote>overwhelmed, sleeping excessively or very little</quote>) and <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> (e.g., <quote>feeling energized, impulsive, engaging in risky behaviors</quote>, <quote>sleeping very little but feeling fine</quote>) suggest a <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>elevated or expansive mood</sym> during episodes supports this. The mood swings are episodic rather than persistent, aligning with the diagnostic criteria for <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The coexistence of anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and intrusive thoughts does not exclude this diagnosis but indicates comorbid features that should be addressed in treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of episode duration, severity, and impact on functioning.  \n2. Consider initiating mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood fluctuations, in conjunction with psychotherapy tailored for bipolar disorder.  \n3. Implement psychoeducation about mood regulation, triggers, and warning signs of episodes to enhance self-awareness and early intervention.  \n4. Address anxiety symptoms and dissociative experiences through specific therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches if relevant.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially related to <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or impulsive behaviors, and develop a safety plan as needed.",
