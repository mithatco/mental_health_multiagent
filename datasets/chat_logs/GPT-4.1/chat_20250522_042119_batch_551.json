There is notable evidence of persistent anxiety, characterized by excessive worry, racing thoughts, irritability, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances are significant, involving difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, alongside reports of restlessness and fatigue. Intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive behaviors, such as checking rituals, further suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features. The patient reports episodic panic attacks and somatic complaints like muscle tension and headaches associated with heightened anxiety. Although no psychotic symptoms are reported, feelings of dissociation and depersonalization are evident during periods of heightened distress. A history of passive suicidal ideation is acknowledged, though no active intent or plans are disclosed. Substance use appears minimal and within low-risk parameters. The patient exhibits social withdrawal and emotional detachment, which may reinforce depressive and anxiety-related symptomatology. Overall, the presentation indicates significant mood and anxiety symptoms with associated functional impairment, warranting comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>lack of interest and pleasure in activities you once enjoyed</sym>, along with a <sym>persistent feeling of being down and hopeless</sym>. You also reported feeling <sym>more irritable and easily frustrated</sym>, which has affected your interactions with others. Sleep issues are prominent, including <sym>difficulty falling asleep, waking up during the night, and feeling restless</sym>. You experience frequent <sym>excessive worry and racing thoughts</sym>, along with episodic <sym>panic attacks that make you feel frightened and overwhelmed</sym>. Additionally, you described engaging in <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym> and feeling <sym>detached or disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. You mentioned feeling <sym>lost about your identity and future goals</sym>, as well as withdrawing from social contacts. While you have had occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, you do not wish to act on them. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and some obsessive-compulsive features, which are significantly impairing your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified (likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Traits</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>Anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>excessive worry, racing thoughts, irritability, and avoidance behaviors</sym> align with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive checking behaviors suggests some obsessive-compulsive features, although not necessarily meeting full criteria for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, further support this mood and anxiety picture. The patient's report of <sym>feelings of dissociation and depersonalization</sym> during distress may indicate underlying stress responses but do not currently point to psychosis. The absence of hallucinations or persistent delusions reduces the likelihood of <med>Schizophrenia</med>. Given the duration and severity of symptoms, this presentation warrants a comprehensive treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, and sleep.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including evidence-based pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants such as SSRIs) and psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a detailed medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical health issues contributing to somatic complaints and sleep disturbances.  \n3. Develop a sleep hygiene plan and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or <sym>self-harm behaviors</sym>, and establish safety planning if needed.  \n5. Explore stress management strategies, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques to address anxiety and dissociative feelings.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
