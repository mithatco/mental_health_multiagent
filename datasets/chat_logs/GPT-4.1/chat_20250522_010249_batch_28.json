This assessment will help us get a broad overview of your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks across different areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, energy, and others. We'll go through each question one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

There is evidence of both depressive symptoms (persistent low interest, hopelessness, fatigue, social withdrawal, and intrusive negative thoughts) and hypomanic or manic features (decreased need for sleep, increased energy during high episodes, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and elevated activity levels). The patient acknowledges experiencing irritability and anxiety, with occasional feelings of being overwhelmed and racing thoughts, as well as dissociative experiences during mood swings.\n\nSleep patterns are notably irregular, alternating between hypersomnia and insomnia, correlating with mood episodes. Cognitive concerns include forgetfulness and distractibility. The patient denies current psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs but admits to transient dissociative states. Suicidal ideation is present but without active plans or intent; no recent self-harm behaviors are reported. Substance use appears limited to social alcohol consumption and stable cigarette smoking, with no recent substance misuse or non-prescribed medication use.\n\nPatterns observed suggest a mood disorder with features consistent with bipolar spectrum pathology, marked by alternating depressive and hypomanic episodes. The patient's responses indicate significant functional impairment and emotional distress, with risk factors including suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes and impulsive behaviors during hypomanic states.\n\nClinical Significance:\n- Mood instability with depressive and hypomanic features\n- Sleep disturbance fluctuating between hypersomnia and insomnia\n- Anxiety symptoms with avoidance behaviors\n- Dissociative experiences during mood episodes\n- Suicidal ideation without current plan or intent\n- Cognitive impairment related to attentional and memory difficulties\n\nRisk Factors/Warning Signs:\n- Depressive episodes with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness\n- Transient suicidal thoughts\n- Engagement in impulsive and risky behaviors during hypomania\n- Dissociative episodes potentially exacerbating emotional regulation challenges\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation warrants comprehensive mood disorder evaluation, with close monitoring of suicidal ideation, impulsivity, and dissociative symptoms, and consideration of bipolar disorder spectrum diagnoses.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a complex pattern of mood fluctuations that include periods of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <med>loss of interest, hopelessness, fatigue, social withdrawal, and intrusive negative thoughts</med>, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>. Your sleep patterns are irregular, swinging between <sym>hypersomnia and insomnia</sym>, which can further impact your emotional state. You also report <sym>anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences during mood swings</sym>, and some <sym>cognitive difficulties like forgetfulness and distractibility</sym>. Importantly, you mention <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> during depressive episodes but clarify that you do not have active plans or intentions. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant mood instability with both depressive and hypomanic features, affecting your daily functioning and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (likely Bipolar II disorder or Cyclothymic Disorder)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <quote>feeling hopeless, losing interest, and feeling worthless</quote>, interspersed with <sym>hypomanic features</sym> such as <quote>less sleep but feeling energized, impulsive behaviors, and risky activities</quote>. The presence of <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> during mood swings and the variability in sleep and activity levels support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> or <sym>full manic episodes</sym> suggests a leaning toward <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> or <med>Cyclothymic Disorder</med>. The symptoms are sufficiently distressing and impairing to warrant clinical attention, though further assessment may be needed to distinguish between these diagnoses definitively.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation** to clarify diagnosis, including assessment of mood episodes, duration, and severity.  \n2. **Implement a mood stabilization treatment plan**, which may include pharmacotherapy such as lithium, valproate, or second-generation antipsychotics, tailored to mood fluctuations.  \n3. **Provide psychoeducation and psychotherapy**, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), to help manage mood swings, improve coping skills, and address anxiety and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. **Monitor for suicidal ideation** regularly and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n5. **Address sleep disturbances** with behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication to promote regular sleep patterns.",
