I'll be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a tool that helps us understand different areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. The goal is to gather information about your current experiences so we can better understand what you're going through and decide on the best next steps for support and treatment. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open.\n\nThe assessment involves me asking you 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. You can respond naturally and honestly, describing your experiences in your own words. There are no right or wrong answers, and I'm here to listen and understand.\n\nAre you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and feeling restless, along with physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, seem to be affecting your daily functioning. You mentioned occasional <sym>passive thoughts of not wanting to continue</sym>, which is concerning, and you\u2019ve experienced intrusive <sym>distressing thoughts</sym>. You also noted feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and questioning your identity and purpose, which can be quite disorienting. It\u2019s understandable that you feel overwhelmed and isolated given these experiences, and your openness about these symptoms is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits multiple core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> such as forgetfulness and concentration difficulties further support this diagnosis. The report of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including worry, avoidance, and feeling overwhelmed, indicates a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component, often seen in depressive episodes. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> are a serious clinical concern but do not constitute active suicidal intent at this time; nevertheless, they warrant close monitoring. The physical somatic complaints and feelings of derealization may be secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms but should be carefully evaluated for any underlying medical conditions. Overall, the symptom pattern aligns with a moderate severity of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive safety assessment, including evaluation of suicidal risk, given the passive death thoughts.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, tailored to the patient's symptoms, alongside psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques for depression and anxiety management.  \n3. Encourage engagement in supportive therapy to address feelings of social withdrawal, identity questioning, and emotional processing.  \n4. Evaluate for any medical conditions contributing to somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances, and coordinate care with primary care or specialists as needed.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and any emergent risk factors.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of depressive and anxiety-related pathology, including pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal. They report persistent low mood, tearfulness, and a diminished capacity to derive pleasure from previously enjoyed activities. Concurrently, the patient exhibits heightened anxiety characterized by excessive worry about the future, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Sleep disturbances are evidenced by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, coupled with fatigue and low energy despite reports of restlessness and agitation. Cognitive concerns include concentration difficulties and episodic forgetfulness, which may reflect mood or anxiety effects on cognition.\n\nThe patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, alongside feelings of emotional and social disconnection, including feelings of detachment from self and others, and questioning of personal identity and life purpose. Although they deny hallucinations, delusional thinking, or paranoid ideation, they acknowledge occasional passive death wishes, which constitute a significant risk factor warranting close monitoring. Substance use appears minimal, with recent abstention from alcohol and tobacco, and no evidence of unsafe medication practices.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The co-occurrence of depressive symptoms (low interest, hopelessness, social withdrawal) and anxiety symptoms (worry, avoidance, hyperarousal) suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorder features.\n- Sleep disturbance, irritability, and somatic complaints support a mood disorder diagnosis, potentially with anxious components.\n- Cognitive and perceptual symptoms are absent; however, feelings of derealization or depersonalization are noted.\n- Passive suicidal ideation indicates elevated clinical concern for self-harm risk, necessitating safety planning.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive death thoughts, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal represent significant risk factors requiring ongoing assessment.\n- No active suicidal plans or intent reported, but further evaluation is recommended.\n- The patient's acknowledgment of feeling misunderstood and overwhelmed highlights potential for emotional distress escalation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient's presentation is characterized by moderate to severe depressive symptoms with accompanying anxiety features, sleep disruption, cognitive impairment, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal. The passive death thoughts and emotional vulnerability warrant vigilant risk assessment and a comprehensive treatment approach targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and social reintegration.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most DSM-5 Level 1 symptom domains thoroughly, including mood, anger, anxiety, sleep, cognition, dissociation, and somatic symptoms. However, there was limited exploration of mania, psychosis, and personality functioning, with some questions only superficially touched upon or omitted entirely. For example, the assessment of psychosis was limited to hearing voices and thought broadcasting, without probing other psychotic symptoms. Additionally, personality functioning was only briefly mentioned in relation to identity questioning but not systematically explored. Overall, coverage was strong but not exhaustive, missing some domains or not delving deeply into certain areas.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Most questions accurately reflect DSM-5 criteria and are phrased in clinically appropriate language. The questions about mood, anxiety, sleep, and suicidality align well with diagnostic criteria. Nonetheless, some questions could be more precise\u2014for example, the phrasing around dissociation and derealization could be clearer to better match DSM terminology. Additionally, the question about physical symptoms ('unexplained aches and pains') is somewhat vague and could be refined to distinguish somatic symptoms of depression or anxiety from medical issues. While generally relevant, certain questions lack nuance or specificity, slightly reducing the overall clinical precision.",
        "consistency": "The conversation follows a logical sequence, generally progressing from mood to anxiety to somatic and cognitive symptoms. However, there are moments where transitions feel somewhat abrupt, particularly when shifting from physical symptoms to dissociation and identity questions. The follow-up on disclosures is mostly adequate but occasionally superficial; for instance, the patient's mention of feeling outside of their body ('like watching themselves') is noted but not explored further to clarify the nature or clinical significance. Overall, flow is acceptable but could be more seamlessly integrated with deeper probing and better linkage between topics.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Moderate Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress is generally supported by the patient's reported symptoms\u2014persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep issues, and anxiety. The reasoning aligns with DSM-5 criteria, citing specific symptoms like hopelessness, sleep disturbance, and social withdrawal. However, the justification lacks depth in differential diagnosis considerations\u2014such as ruling out bipolar disorder (mania/hypomania), examining the duration and severity of symptoms in more detail, or exploring the significance of dissociative and identity concerns. The mention of derealization and identity questioning is acknowledged but not explicitly connected to the depression or anxiety, which could suggest other diagnoses like dissociative disorders. Overall, justification is adequate but could be more comprehensive and explicit.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional tone and demonstrates empathy through validating the patient's feelings and providing reassurance. The opening establishes a safe space, and responses acknowledge distress effectively, such as thanking the patient for honesty and emphasizing the importance of sharing difficult feelings. However, some interactions could be warmer and more personalized\u2014for example, explicitly reflecting the patient\u2019s emotional experience or using more empathetic affirmations. The responses are generally appropriate but could benefit from more active empathetic engagement to foster deeper rapport."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates strong coverage of most DSM-5 symptom domains with clinically relevant questioning and a generally logical flow. The clinician shows professionalism and empathy, effectively gathering meaningful information to support diagnosis. However, there are notable gaps in comprehensive assessment\u2014particularly in the areas of psychosis, mania, and personality functioning\u2014and some questions could be more precise and nuanced. The diagnostic justification is adequate but should include more explicit differential considerations, especially given the dissociative and identity symptoms reported. Overall, this is a solid assessment with room for improvement in depth, breadth, and clinical nuance. A score of 4 across most categories reflects high-quality work but acknowledges areas where more thoroughness and refinement are possible.",

The expected profile is 'adjustment,' which typically involves transient emotional or behavioral responses to identifiable stressors and usually does not meet criteria for a major mood disorder. The given diagnosis does not align with the adjustment profile, as it describes a clinical mood disorder rather than a normal or expected reaction to stress.",

You also described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and feeling restless, along with physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, seem to be affecting your daily functioning. You mentioned occasional <sym>passive thoughts of not wanting to continue</sym>, which is concerning, and you\u2019ve experienced intrusive <sym>distressing thoughts</sym>. You also noted feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and questioning your identity and purpose, which can be quite disorienting. It\u2019s understandable that you feel overwhelmed and isolated given these experiences, and your openness about these symptoms is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits multiple core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>psychomotor agitation</sym>, and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> such as forgetfulness and concentration difficulties further support this diagnosis. The report of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including worry, avoidance, and feeling overwhelmed, indicates a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component, often seen in depressive episodes. The passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> are a serious clinical concern but do not constitute active suicidal intent at this time; nevertheless, they warrant close monitoring. The physical somatic complaints and feelings of derealization may be secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms but should be carefully evaluated for any underlying medical conditions. Overall, the symptom pattern aligns with a moderate severity of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive safety assessment, including evaluation of suicidal risk, given the passive death thoughts.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, tailored to the patient's symptoms, alongside psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques for depression and anxiety management.  \n3. Encourage engagement in supportive therapy to address feelings of social withdrawal, identity questioning, and emotional processing.  \n4. Evaluate for any medical conditions contributing to somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances, and coordinate care with primary care or specialists as needed.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and any emergent risk factors.",
