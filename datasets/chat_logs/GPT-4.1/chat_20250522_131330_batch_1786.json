Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health domains over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to better understand your current mental health status and identify any areas where you might need support. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open about your experiences. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

The patient also experiences intense <sym>intrusive memories</sym> and <sym>flashbacks</sym> of the event, along with hyperarousal signs such as <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, exaggerated startle responses, and avoidance of trauma-related stimuli like driving and watching certain media. They describe difficulty sleeping, including nocturnal panic episodes, and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and disorientation.

Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, monitor for suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan as needed.\n4. Address substance use concerns, possibly involving motivational interviewing or referral to a substance use specialist.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>PTSD</med> and coping strategies for managing symptoms.\n6. Evaluate the need for additional support services, such as peer support groups or social services, to assist with social withdrawal and functional recovery.\n7.

There is notable emotional numbing and feelings of detachment from self and others, alongside persistent feelings of hopelessness and depressed mood. The patient reports sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, often accompanied by panic episodes during nocturnal awakenings. Cognitive impairments are evident, with reported memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments. \n\nMood symptoms include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of worthlessness or loss of identity, especially since the incident. The patient describes irritability, anger outbursts, and heightened anxiety, particularly in response to loud noises or reminders of the trauma. Additionally, there is evidence of maladaptive coping strategies, notably increased alcohol consumption on most nights, which may serve as a form of self-medication for distress and sleep difficulties. Passive suicidal ideation is reported without intent or plan, warranting close monitoring.\n\nThe pattern of symptoms suggests a complex presentation involving trauma-related disorder, mood disturbances, and substance use issues. Risk factors include recurrent intrusive symptoms, panic episodes, alcohol use as a coping mechanism, and social withdrawal. The clinical picture warrants comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning to address trauma, mood, sleep, and substance use concerns.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes experiencing a range of distressing symptoms following a recent traumatic <med>accident</med>. They report persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and a loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed, which suggests ongoing mood disturbances. The patient also experiences intense <sym>intrusive memories</sym> and <sym>flashbacks</sym> of the event, along with hyperarousal signs such as <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, exaggerated startle responses, and avoidance of trauma-related stimuli like driving and watching certain media. They describe difficulty sleeping, including nocturnal panic episodes, and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and disorientation. Furthermore, their increased alcohol use appears to serve as a maladaptive coping strategy to manage distress and sleep issues. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> adds concern for their safety, warranting careful monitoring.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with DSM-5 criteria for <med>PTSD</med>. They exhibit re-experiencing symptoms such as <sym>intrusive memories</sym> and <sym>flashbacks</sym>; avoidance behaviors related to trauma reminders; persistent <sym>negative alterations in mood and cognition</sym> like feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and loss of identity; and hyperarousal symptoms including <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, <sym>exaggerated startle response</sym>, and sleep disturbances. The duration of symptoms exceeds one month, and they significantly impair functioning. The patient's alcohol use likely exacerbates their condition, and their passive suicidal thoughts indicate a need for safety assessment. These findings collectively support a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> following trauma.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapies such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Prolonged Exposure (PE) to target re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms.\n2. Consider pharmacologic treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs to address mood symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, in conjunction with therapy.\n3. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, monitor for suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan as needed.\n4. Address substance use concerns, possibly involving motivational interviewing or referral to a substance use specialist.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>PTSD</med> and coping strategies for managing symptoms.\n6. Evaluate the need for additional support services, such as peer support groups or social services, to assist with social withdrawal and functional recovery.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",
