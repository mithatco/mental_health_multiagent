This questionnaire is designed to get a broad overview of different mental health domains that might be affecting you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you.

You also mention feeling <sym>irritable and on edge</sym>, experiencing <sym>anxiety and worry</sym> most of the time, and having <sym>panic episodes</sym> in stressful situations. Sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>less sleep but high energy</sym>, and you've noticed <sym>muscle aches, headaches</sym> and some forgetfulness. Additionally, you describe <sym>feeling disconnected from yourself</sym> and more <sym>isolated from others</sym>. These symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being. Your honesty about these experiences is important, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Obsessive-Compulsive Features; Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>anxiety, worry, and feeling on edge</sym> (Q7) suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17, Q18) indicates <med>OCD features</med>. The reports of <sym>dissociation or feeling detached</sym> (Q19) point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. Sleep disturbances, physical complaints, and cognitive issues further support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. The absence of psychosis or substance misuse reduces the likelihood of other diagnoses such as psychotic disorders or substance-induced conditions. Overall, these symptoms are interfering with your daily life and emotional health, warranting a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a full psychiatric assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms and risk factors, including suicidality.\n2. Develop a multidisciplinary treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication management, and lifestyle modifications.\n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions or medication as appropriate, and explore physical health evaluations for somatic complaints.\n4. Consider referrals to specialists such as a psychiatrist for medication evaluation, especially given the complex symptom profile.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and develop coping strategies to manage symptoms.\n6. Establish safety planning if there are ongoing concerns about self-harm or suicidal thoughts.",

Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by reduced sleep duration coupled with maintained or increased energy levels (Q5), and disrupted sleep quality (Q15). There are reports of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (Q17, Q18), suggestive of obsessive-compulsive features, alongside feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (Q19). The patient also reports physical symptoms such as unexplained aches and headaches (Q10), and cognitive concerns like forgetfulness (Q16). Social withdrawal and decreased interest in relationships are also evident (Q21).\n\nPatterns in responses reveal co-occurring mood symptoms and anxiety, with some features aligning with depressive syndromes, including anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal, as well as anxiety-related symptoms such as pervasive worry, avoidance, and panic episodes. The absence of hallucinations, psychotic symptoms, or substance misuse reduces immediate psychosis or substance use concerns.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and dissociative experiences. The presence of dark thoughts and occasional panic indicates a need to assess for suicidality or self-harm risk, although the patient denies active intent. No immediate substance-related risk factors are identified.\n\nIn summary, the clinical picture suggests a complex presentation with prominent depressive and anxiety features, accompanied by dissociative experiences and somatic complaints. Further comprehensive assessment is warranted to evaluate the severity, functional impact, and safety considerations, and to inform appropriate intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of experiences that reflect significant emotional distress and some physical symptoms. You\u2019ve been feeling <sym>persistent sadness and hopelessness</sym>, with a loss of interest in daily activities. You also mention feeling <sym>irritable and on edge</sym>, experiencing <sym>anxiety and worry</sym> most of the time, and having <sym>panic episodes</sym> in stressful situations. Sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>less sleep but high energy</sym>, and you've noticed <sym>muscle aches, headaches</sym> and some forgetfulness. Additionally, you describe <sym>feeling disconnected from yourself</sym> and more <sym>isolated from others</sym>. These symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being. Your honesty about these experiences is important, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Obsessive-Compulsive Features; Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>anxiety, worry, and feeling on edge</sym> (Q7) suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17, Q18) indicates <med>OCD features</med>. The reports of <sym>dissociation or feeling detached</sym> (Q19) point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. Sleep disturbances, physical complaints, and cognitive issues further support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. The absence of psychosis or substance misuse reduces the likelihood of other diagnoses such as psychotic disorders or substance-induced conditions. Overall, these symptoms are interfering with your daily life and emotional health, warranting a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a full psychiatric assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms and risk factors, including suicidality.\n2. Develop a multidisciplinary treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), medication management, and lifestyle modifications.\n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions or medication as appropriate, and explore physical health evaluations for somatic complaints.\n4. Consider referrals to specialists such as a psychiatrist for medication evaluation, especially given the complex symptom profile.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and develop coping strategies to manage symptoms.\n6. Establish safety planning if there are ongoing concerns about self-harm or suicidal thoughts.",
