We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps us identify areas that might need further attention and ensure we're providing the best care possible. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The process will involve answering 23 questions about different aspects of your mood, thoughts, and feelings. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I appreciate your openness. Are you ready to begin?"

You described persistent <sym>low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym> that have lasted over the past few weeks, along with <sym>irritability and irritability-related distress</sym>. You've also experienced <sym>significant anxiety, worry, and avoidance</sym>, which seem to affect your daily life. Additionally, you've reported <sym>hearing voices and sensations of thought broadcasting</sym>, though you recognize these as stress-related and not entirely real. Sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and episodes of impulsivity and risky behavior further complicate your situation. Importantly, you mentioned <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> and some episodes of <sym>binge drinking</sym>. All these symptoms suggest a mood disorder with episodic features, possibly cycling between depressive and hypomanic or manic states, along with anxiety and psychotic-like experiences. I understand this is a lot to carry, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with psychotic features and anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history indicates episodes of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, consistent with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> points to hypomanic or manic episodes, which seem to occur episodically. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting</sym> suggest psychotic features that can occur during mood episodes in <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and avoidance behaviors fit with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodic nature of mood symptoms, including periods of low and elevated mood, along with psychotic features, aligns best with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The patient's insight into the non-reality of hallucinations and the episodic mood swings support this impression. While some somatic complaints are present, they seem secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms rather than indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm mood episodes, psychotic features, and current severity.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicide risk.\n3. Initiate mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) under psychiatric supervision to manage mood cycling.\n4. Consider adding an antipsychotic medication if psychotic features persist or are distressing.\n5. Incorporate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage symptoms and improve coping skills.\n6. Address comorbid anxiety with appropriate interventions, which may include therapy or medication.\n7. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and routine maintenance.\n8. Monitor substance use, particularly alcohol consumption, and offer support or referrals for substance use management as needed.\n9. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust the plan accordingly.",

Notably, there is a persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, with more than half of the past two weeks characterized by depressive symptoms such as low mood, anhedonia, and social withdrawal. The patient also endorses significant irritability and irritability-related distress, alongside pervasive anxiety, worry, and avoidance behaviors, suggestive of comorbid anxiety features. \n\nPsychotic-like experiences include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and thought broadcasting sensations, which, although acknowledged as stress-related and perceived as non-real, warrant further assessment for psychosis spectrum symptoms. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with fluctuations between hypersomnia and insomnia, contributing to cognitive and functional impairment. Cognitive concerns include transient memory difficulties and disorientation, particularly under stress.\n\nThe patient reports episodes of elevated mood characterized by decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, consistent with manic or hypomanic episodes. These episodes appear episodic and contextually linked to stress levels. Repetitive thoughts, compulsive routines, and dissociative feelings suggest possible features of obsessive-compulsive or dissociative phenomena.\n\nSubstance use is notable, with recent episodes of binge drinking (4+ drinks), which may serve as an affect regulation strategy. No tobacco or medication misuse reported. Suicidal ideation is acknowledged as fleeting but present during low periods, representing a potential risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation reflects a complex mood disorder with evidence of bipolar cycling, comorbid anxiety, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints. The pattern of symptoms warrants comprehensive assessment for mood disorder diagnosis (potential bipolar spectrum), psychosis spectrum features, and comorbid anxiety disorders, alongside safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts.",

The reasoning notes episodic mood swings between depression and hypomanic or manic states, psychotic features during mood episodes, and features characteristic of bipolar disorder, confirming the diagnosis's accuracy.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your experiences, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to manage these feelings and symptoms. You described persistent <sym>low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym> that have lasted over the past few weeks, along with <sym>irritability and irritability-related distress</sym>. You've also experienced <sym>significant anxiety, worry, and avoidance</sym>, which seem to affect your daily life. Additionally, you've reported <sym>hearing voices and sensations of thought broadcasting</sym>, though you recognize these as stress-related and not entirely real. Sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and episodes of impulsivity and risky behavior further complicate your situation. Importantly, you mentioned <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> and some episodes of <sym>binge drinking</sym>. All these symptoms suggest a mood disorder with episodic features, possibly cycling between depressive and hypomanic or manic states, along with anxiety and psychotic-like experiences. I understand this is a lot to carry, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with psychotic features and anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history indicates episodes of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, consistent with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> points to hypomanic or manic episodes, which seem to occur episodically. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting</sym> suggest psychotic features that can occur during mood episodes in <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and avoidance behaviors fit with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodic nature of mood symptoms, including periods of low and elevated mood, along with psychotic features, aligns best with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The patient's insight into the non-reality of hallucinations and the episodic mood swings support this impression. While some somatic complaints are present, they seem secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms rather than indicative of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm mood episodes, psychotic features, and current severity.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicide risk.\n3. Initiate mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) under psychiatric supervision to manage mood cycling.\n4. Consider adding an antipsychotic medication if psychotic features persist or are distressing.\n5. Incorporate psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage symptoms and improve coping skills.\n6. Address comorbid anxiety with appropriate interventions, which may include therapy or medication.\n7. Provide psychoeducation about bipolar disorder, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and routine maintenance.\n8. Monitor substance use, particularly alcohol consumption, and offer support or referrals for substance use management as needed.\n9. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust the plan accordingly.",
