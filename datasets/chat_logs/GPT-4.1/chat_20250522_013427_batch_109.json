This tool helps us get a broad picture of different mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions covering various areas such as mood, anxiety, obsessions and compulsions, and more. There's no right or wrong answers\u2014just answer honestly based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The presence of intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, combined with compulsive behaviors like repeated hand-washing, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization or derealization suggest additional dissociative phenomena, possibly related to trauma or high psychological distress.

Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, after consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and combination of symptoms.  \n4. Refer for a sleep assessment to address ongoing sleep disturbances and explore behavioral strategies or medical interventions.  \n5. Monitor dissociative symptoms closely and evaluate for underlying trauma or stress-related disorders, possibly involving trauma-informed therapy if appropriate.",

They also endorse significant anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. Sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and fragmented sleep contribute to daytime fatigue. The patient exhibits intrusive thoughts with compulsive behaviors, notably repeated hand-washing and checking, suggestive of obsessive-compulsive features. They report episodes of emotional dysregulation manifesting as irritability and anger outbursts. Additionally, they describe dissociative experiences such as depersonalization or derealization, as well as cognitive concerns including forgetfulness and confusion. The presence of fleeting suicidal ideation without current plans or intent warrants careful monitoring. No psychotic symptoms, substance use, or perceptual disturbances are endorsed.\n\nPattern Analysis:\n- Co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms with obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\n- Sleep impairment and fatigue resulting from insomnia.\n- Dissociative experiences alongside intrusive thoughts.\n- Emotional dysregulation with irritability and anger.\n- Feelings of social withdrawal and emotional detachment.\n\nPotential Clinical Significance:\n- Major depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features.\n- Dissociative phenomena may require further assessment for dissociative disorders or trauma-related conditions.\n- Suicidal ideation, albeit fleeting, necessitates safety planning and close monitoring.\n\nRisk Factors/Warning Signs:\n- Suicidal thoughts, even transient, indicating increased risk.\n- Significant functional impairment due to mood, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.\n- Emotional instability and irritability that could impact interpersonal relationships and safety.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by depressive, anxious, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, accompanied by dissociative experiences and sleep disturbance. The presence of suicidal ideation underscores the importance of thorough risk assessment and ongoing safety evaluation.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of ongoing emotional and cognitive struggles. You describe persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in things I used to enjoy</quote> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that seem to weigh heavily on you. Alongside these, you experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including constant worry, moments of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors to manage your fears. Sleep issues, like <sym>difficulty falling asleep and fragmented sleep</sym>, are affecting your daily energy and mood. You also report intrusive <sym>thoughts about contamination and harm</sym>, which lead to compulsive <sym>hand-washing and checking behaviors</sym>. Dissociative feelings such as <quote>feeling like I\u2019m watching myself from outside</quote> and episodes of <sym>confusion or forgetfulness</sym> add to your distress. Notably, you mention <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and require careful attention. Your feelings of <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>emotional detachment</sym> further impact your relationships, and your worries about being dismissed or misunderstood highlight your emotional vulnerability.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features, with dissociative experiences and low risk of active suicidality.\n\n**Reasoning:** The persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>hopelessness</quote> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with sleep disturbance and feelings of worthlessness, support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including excessive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, indicate comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, combined with compulsive behaviors like repeated hand-washing, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization or derealization suggest additional dissociative phenomena, possibly related to trauma or high psychological distress. The fleeting <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> necessitate ongoing safety monitoring but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent. Overall, the presentation reflects a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, after consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and combination of symptoms.  \n4. Refer for a sleep assessment to address ongoing sleep disturbances and explore behavioral strategies or medical interventions.  \n5. Monitor dissociative symptoms closely and evaluate for underlying trauma or stress-related disorders, possibly involving trauma-informed therapy if appropriate.",
