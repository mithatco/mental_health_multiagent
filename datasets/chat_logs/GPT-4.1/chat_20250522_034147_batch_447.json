Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This is a standard assessment that helps us identify areas that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

The chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.

There is a notable presence of anxiety symptoms characterized by persistent worry, heightened irritability, and specific phobias related to driving and external stimuli (sirens, loud noises). The patient reports sleep disturbances manifesting as insomnia, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep, compounded by the use of self-medication (sleeping pills, substances). Cognitive concerns include memory difficulties and disorientation, alongside dissociative experiences such as depersonalization. Psychotic-like symptoms are evidenced by auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation (belief that others can read thoughts or judge them). The individual endorses passive suicidal ideation without explicit plan but admits to dark thoughts and self-harm considerations, raising safety concerns. Substance use appears maladaptive, with increased alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed medication use to manage distress.\n\nPattern observations highlight co-occurring affective, anxiety, dissociative, and psychotic symptoms, with significant functional impairment. Risk factors include active suicidal ideation, substance misuse, dissociative experiences, and avoidance behaviors. The clinical picture suggests the need for comprehensive assessment to evaluate for mood disorder, trauma-related symptoms, and potential psychotic features, alongside immediate safety planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your recent experiences. It\u2019s clear that you're going through a lot\u2014feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>lost</sym>, struggling with persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative sensations</sym>. You've also been dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>physical pains</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms significantly impact your daily life, relationships, and sense of safety. Your honesty about your struggles is a brave step toward seeking help, and you deserve support and compassion as you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder and features suggestive of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and possible Psychotic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>persistent depressed mood</sym> over the past two weeks suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The auditory <sym>hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoia</sym> (belief that others can read thoughts or judge them), and dissociative experiences (feeling <sym>detached</sym> or <sym>not here</sym>) raise concern for psychotic features, which may be part of a <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> diagnosis, especially considering the re-experiencing of the accident and associated fears. The active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harming urges</sym> warrant urgent attention. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication\u2014further complicates the clinical picture and may exacerbate the symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess the severity of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm risks</sym>.  \n3. Refer to a mental health specialist for possible <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as trauma-focused therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy).  \n4. Consider psychiatric evaluation for medication management targeting <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>psychotic symptoms</med>.  \n5. Address substance use issues through counseling and support groups, aiming for reduction or cessation of harmful behaviors.  \n6. Incorporate psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and provide support for managing <sym>sleep difficulties</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>.  \n7. Ensure regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment adherence, adjusting interventions as needed.",
