Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health domains over the past two weeks. The purpose is to identify areas that might need further attention and to guide any future support or treatment. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment includes 23 questions covering different aspects of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn. There's no rush, and you can answer honestly and comfortably. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

They also experience ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>social avoidance</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>cognitive functioning</sym> such as forgetfulness. Additionally, they describe episodes of <sym>derealization or emotional detachment</sym>, which can be distressing.

Sleep disturbances and cognitive issues further support this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>psychotic features</sym> suggests a moderate severity rather than severe. Given the complexity and overlap of symptoms, a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety features is most fitting, but ongoing assessment is necessary to confirm this and to rule out other comorbidities.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressant medications</med>, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, under close supervision.  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication.  \n4. Monitor for any emergence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n5.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms consistent with depressive and anxiety features, including anhedonia (diminished interest in activities), pervasive feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and social withdrawal. They describe increased irritability and a heightened sense of being on edge, suggestive of underlying irritability and anxiety pathology. Sleep disturbances are noted as irregular, with difficulties maintaining sleep, contributing to daytime fatigue. Cognitive complaints include forgetfulness and difficulties with concentration, indicative of possible neurocognitive impact associated with mood or anxiety symptoms. The patient also endorses feelings of emotional numbness or derealization, as well as transient feelings of being disconnected from self and surroundings, which may reflect dissociative experiences. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by reports of social avoidance, fear of social situations, and panic-like sensations in social contexts. Importantly, the patient denies suicidal ideation or intent but acknowledges feeling overwhelmed and misunderstood by others.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, low mood) and anxiety symptoms (worry, social avoidance, physical tension).\n- Presence of dissociative experiences and feelings of emotional detachment.\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive difficulties are contributing to overall functional impairment.\n- Social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors align with social anxiety features.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Focus:**\n- Mood disorder (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder)\n- Anxiety disorder (e.g., Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder)\n- Dissociative experiences warrant further exploration\n- Sleep disturbances impacting mental health\n- Cognitive functioning assessment\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- No current suicidal ideation or intent reported.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and being overwhelmed, which may elevate risk if symptoms worsen.\n- Dissociative symptoms and social withdrawal suggest potential for increased functional impairment if unaddressed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety, social avoidance, cognitive difficulties, and dissociative experiences. The symptom profile indicates the need for comprehensive assessment to delineate primary diagnoses and to formulate an appropriate treatment plan targeting mood regulation, anxiety management, and cognitive support.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that significantly impact their daily life. They report persistent <sym>loss of interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. They also experience ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>social avoidance</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>cognitive functioning</sym> such as forgetfulness. Additionally, they describe episodes of <sym>derealization or emotional detachment</sym>, which can be distressing. Although they do not endorse <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or <sym>hallucinations</sym>, these symptoms collectively suggest significant emotional distress and functional impairment that warrants careful clinical attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of prominent <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>social avoidance</sym>, and <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> suggest additional <med>Anxious Distress</med> features. The reports of <sym>derealization</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> indicate possible transient dissociative symptoms, common in mood and anxiety disorders. Sleep disturbances and cognitive issues further support this diagnosis. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>psychotic features</sym> suggests a moderate severity rather than severe. Given the complexity and overlap of symptoms, a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent anxiety features is most fitting, but ongoing assessment is necessary to confirm this and to rule out other comorbidities.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressant medications</med>, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, under close supervision.  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication.  \n4. Monitor for any emergence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for <med>dissociative symptoms</med> or other comorbid conditions to tailor treatment further.",
