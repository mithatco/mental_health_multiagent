This assessment is designed to understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other areas. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time, and I appreciate your honesty in answering them.

It\u2019s important that you\u2019re reaching out, and these symptoms deserve careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode hypomanic or depressive, with mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness, anhedonia, intrusive thoughts, fatigue, and social withdrawal</sym>, alongside <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> including <sym>decreased need for sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and racing thoughts</sym>, suggests a <med>Bipolar disorder</med> spectrum disorder. The episodic nature, with clear periods of mood elevation and depression, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>impulsivity</sym> during hypomanic phases further aligns with <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. While substance use is present, it appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary substance dependence. The patient's experience of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>emotional disconnection</sym> also fits within the broader context of bipolar mood fluctuations.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and frequency of mood episodes.  \n2. Develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes mood stabilizers, such as lithium or valproate, possibly combined with psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy).  \n3. Address substance use through psychoeducation and, if necessary, referral to specialized substance use treatment.  \n4. Implement safety planning to monitor and support the patient regarding <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep, routine, and self-care strategies to stabilize mood fluctuations.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems to provide ongoing support and education about <med>Bipolar disorder</med>.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a history of mood fluctuations characterized by episodic depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms. During depressive episodes, they report anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, persistent negative intrusive thoughts, fatigue, hypersomnia, cognitive difficulties such as impaired concentration and memory, social withdrawal, and feelings of emotional disconnection. During manic or hypomanic episodes, they endorse decreased need for sleep, heightened energy, impulsivity (e.g., risky behaviors, impulsive spending, and relationship pursuits), elevated mood, irritability, racing thoughts, and increased goal-directed activity. The patient also describes episodic anxiety, with some avoidance behaviors when depressed, and a lack of panic attacks.\n\nSubstance use includes occasional smoking and recreational marijuana use, primarily as a coping mechanism for mood symptoms. There are reported thoughts of self-harm during depressive states, though without a current plan or intent. Somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches are noted, possibly stress-related.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The symptom profile suggests significant mood variability consistent with bipolar disorder, likely bipolar I or II, given the presence of both depressive and hypomanic features.\n- The episodic nature of symptoms, including sleep disturbances, impulsivity, and mood changes, aligns with bipolar spectrum pathology.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of invalidation may indicate comorbid features of mood disorder-related cognitive distortions or possibly underlying anxiety.\n- Substance use behaviors and thoughts of self-harm warrant ongoing monitoring due to potential risk factors.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Past suicidal ideation during depressive episodes indicates a need for safety assessment.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes increase the risk for adverse consequences.\n- Substance use as a maladaptive coping strategy may exacerbate mood instability.\n- Feelings of emotional invalidation and social withdrawal could impair interpersonal functioning and support systems.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a pattern of episodic mood disturbance characterized by alternating depressive and hypomanic symptoms, including anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, decreased sleep, impulsivity, racing thoughts, and episodic anxiety. There are notable cognitive and somatic complaints, along with some self-harm ideation during depressive states. These findings suggest a bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid features of anxiety and substance use, necessitating comprehensive assessment and tailored intervention planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating moods and experiences that significantly impact your daily life. It\u2019s clear that you go through periods where you feel <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>disinterested</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and during these times, you also experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and <sym>feelings of disconnection</sym>. At other times, especially during your <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym>, you describe feeling <sym>energized</sym>, <sym>sleeping very little</sym>, and engaging in impulsive, risky behaviors like overspending and starting new projects. You also note episodes of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>withdrawal</sym>, and some <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> during depressive states. Substance use, including occasional smoking and marijuana, appears to be a way you try to cope. Your experiences with <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>emotional disconnection</sym> highlight the significant challenges you face across mood states. It\u2019s important that you\u2019re reaching out, and these symptoms deserve careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I disorder, current or most recent episode hypomanic or depressive, with mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness, anhedonia, intrusive thoughts, fatigue, and social withdrawal</sym>, alongside <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> including <sym>decreased need for sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and racing thoughts</sym>, suggests a <med>Bipolar disorder</med> spectrum disorder. The episodic nature, with clear periods of mood elevation and depression, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> during depressive episodes and <sym>impulsivity</sym> during hypomanic phases further aligns with <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. While substance use is present, it appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary substance dependence. The patient's experience of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>emotional disconnection</sym> also fits within the broader context of bipolar mood fluctuations.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and frequency of mood episodes.  \n2. Develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes mood stabilizers, such as lithium or valproate, possibly combined with psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy).  \n3. Address substance use through psychoeducation and, if necessary, referral to specialized substance use treatment.  \n4. Implement safety planning to monitor and support the patient regarding <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep, routine, and self-care strategies to stabilize mood fluctuations.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems to provide ongoing support and education about <med>Bipolar disorder</med>.",
