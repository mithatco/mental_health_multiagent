The presence of <sym>chronic worry, hypervigilance, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates significant <med>anxiety disorder</med> features, specifically <med>panic disorder</med>. The physical symptoms during panic episodes and avoidance of situations that trigger panic support this diagnosis.

The reported <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the need for safety assessment and appropriate intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression and panic symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, tailored to the patient's needs.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, panic management, and coping skills.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n5. Develop a safety plan and consider close monitoring or crisis resources if passive suicidal thoughts persist.",

They report significant anxiety characterized by chronic worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors, particularly related to panic attacks and fear of specific situations (public transport, crowded environments). Panic attacks are frequent, with associated physical symptoms such as tachycardia, sweating, dizziness, and dissociation, indicating substantial panic disorder features. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulties initiating and maintaining restful sleep, contributing to daytime exhaustion.\n\nAdditional concerns include somatic complaints (headaches, back pain, unexplained stomach discomfort), intrusive thoughts related to health and safety, and feelings of emotional numbness or depersonalization, particularly during panic episodes. The patient expresses feelings of being dismissed or misunderstood by others, which aligns with social withdrawal and reduced engagement with close relationships.\n\nPatterns of clinical significance include:\n- Mood symptoms consistent with depression (anhedonia, hopelessness)\n- Anxiety symptoms including generalized worry, panic attacks, and avoidance\n- Somatic complaints likely associated with heightened physiological arousal\n- Intrusive and ruminative thoughts about health and safety\n- Dissociative experiences during episodes of heightened anxiety\n- Social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement\n\nRisk factors and warning signs:\n- Presence of passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan\n- Recurrent panic attacks and avoidance behaviors heightening functional impairment\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness indicating potential severity of depressive symptoms\n- Somatic complaints and perceived invalidation, which may complicate clinical presentation\n\nOverall, the patient's symptom profile suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorder features, with significant distress impacting daily functioning and social connectedness. Further comprehensive assessment and safety evaluation are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and persistent <sym>low mood</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious most of the time</sym>, with frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> involving physical sensations like <sym>heart pounding, sweating, and dizziness</sym>, along with fears of having attacks in public or crowded places. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>waking up at night and feeling restless</sym>, and you experience <sym>intrusive thoughts about your health and safety</sym>. Additionally, you reported <sym>detachment during panic episodes</sym>, <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as headaches and stomach discomfort, and feelings of <quote>being dismissed or misunderstood</quote> by others. You also noted some <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, although you haven't acted on them. Overall, these symptoms have caused you considerable distress and social withdrawal, impacting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Major Depressive Episode) with Comorbid Anxiety Disorder (Panic Disorder)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core features of <med>major depressive disorder</med>, such as <sym>anhedonia, hopelessness, persistent low mood, and social withdrawal</sym>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry, hypervigilance, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym> indicates significant <med>anxiety disorder</med> features, specifically <med>panic disorder</med>. The physical symptoms during panic episodes and avoidance of situations that trigger panic support this diagnosis. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of detachment further corroborate the comorbid mood and anxiety symptomatology. The reported <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> highlights the need for safety assessment and appropriate intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression and panic symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, tailored to the patient's needs.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, panic management, and coping skills.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n5. Develop a safety plan and consider close monitoring or crisis resources if passive suicidal thoughts persist.",
