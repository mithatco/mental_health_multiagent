You feel a persistent <sym>lack of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that affects your enjoyment of activities you used to find meaningful. You also describe ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, including fears about having <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoiding situations like crowded places. These panic episodes involve intense sensations such as difficulty breathing and a loss of control, which are very distressing. Additionally, you report <sym>trouble sleeping</sym>, intrusive thoughts, feelings of <sym>detachment or dissociation</sym> during panic attacks, and social withdrawal. You also mention having <sym>dark thoughts</sym> related to self-harm. Your symptoms have caused significant emotional pain and interfere with your daily life, and your openness about these experiences is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. The presence of frequent, uncontrollable <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with ongoing <sym>worry</sym> about future attacks and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, indicates comorbid <med>GAD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> during panic episodes, along with dark thoughts about self-harm, suggest potential risk factors that require careful monitoring. While symptoms of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and dissociation are notable, there is no evidence of psychotic features. The overall clinical picture aligns with mood and anxiety disorders that are impacting the patient's functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, especially regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if necessary.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, tailored to treat depression and anxiety, and monitor for response and side effects.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>panic attacks</med> and <med>anxiety management strategies</med>, including relaxation techniques and grounding exercises.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment adherence, and safety concerns.\n6. If symptoms of dissociation or panic are severe or worsening, refer to a mental health specialist with expertise in trauma and dissociative disorders.\n7. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning, if appropriate.",

Notably, the patient reports ongoing low interest in previously enjoyed activities, persistent depressive mood, and feelings of hopelessness. Anxiety symptoms include frequent worry about future panic episodes, avoidance behaviors targeting situations perceived as triggers, and episodes of panic characterized by physiological symptoms such as shortness of breath and fear of losing control. The patient also reports intrusive ruminative thoughts, sleep disturbances (difficulty maintaining sleep), and episodes of dissociation during panic attacks. Additionally, there are indications of social withdrawal, with diminished engagement with close relationships. The patient endorses suicidal ideation without explicit mention of intent or plan, which warrants careful assessment.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent presence of mood and anxiety symptoms, with concurrent affective and somatic manifestations, including irritability, restlessness, and somatic complaints (headaches, stomachaches). The absence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thoughts) is noted. Risk factors include suicidal ideation and significant functional impairment due to avoidance and withdrawal. No current substance use or self-medication behaviors are reported.\n\nIn summary, the clinical presentation suggests a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, heightened risk for self-harm, and functional impairment related to avoidance behaviors. Further assessment is needed to evaluate the severity, safety concerns, and appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past two weeks. You feel a persistent <sym>lack of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that affects your enjoyment of activities you used to find meaningful. You also describe ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, including fears about having <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoiding situations like crowded places. These panic episodes involve intense sensations such as difficulty breathing and a loss of control, which are very distressing. Additionally, you report <sym>trouble sleeping</sym>, intrusive thoughts, feelings of <sym>detachment or dissociation</sym> during panic attacks, and social withdrawal. You also mention having <sym>dark thoughts</sym> related to self-harm. Your symptoms have caused significant emotional pain and interfere with your daily life, and your openness about these experiences is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>insomnia</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. The presence of frequent, uncontrollable <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with ongoing <sym>worry</sym> about future attacks and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, indicates comorbid <med>GAD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> during panic episodes, along with dark thoughts about self-harm, suggest potential risk factors that require careful monitoring. While symptoms of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and dissociation are notable, there is no evidence of psychotic features. The overall clinical picture aligns with mood and anxiety disorders that are impacting the patient's functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, especially regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if necessary.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatment, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, tailored to treat depression and anxiety, and monitor for response and side effects.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about <med>panic attacks</med> and <med>anxiety management strategies</med>, including relaxation techniques and grounding exercises.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment adherence, and safety concerns.\n6. If symptoms of dissociation or panic are severe or worsening, refer to a mental health specialist with expertise in trauma and dissociative disorders.\n7. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning, if appropriate.",
