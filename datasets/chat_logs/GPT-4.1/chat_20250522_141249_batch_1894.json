Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia and anhedonic mood, expressed as diminished interest in activities and feelings of hopelessness, particularly associated with anniversary-related triggers. The patient reports persistent irritability, difficulty sleeping characterized by frequent nocturnal awakenings with associated anxiety, and fatigue. Anxiety manifests as a pervasive sense of being on edge, heightened startle response to sirens and loud noises, and avoidance behaviors such as refraining from driving and riding as a passenger, suggestive of agoraphobic tendencies secondary to trauma.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are noted, including concentration difficulties, memory issues, depersonalization, and derealization. Intrusive thoughts related to a traumatic event are prominent, alongside compulsive behaviors like checking and washing. The patient experiences emotional numbing and social withdrawal, reporting diminished close connections and feelings of identity confusion. Substance use appears maladaptive, with increased alcohol consumption and occasional self-medication with sleep aids and cannabis, raising concerns about dependence and exacerbation of mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (thoughts of hurting oneself), substance misuse, and significant functional impairment across mood, cognitive, and social domains. The patient's reports of feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, and experiencing intrusive trauma-related memories underscore the need for urgent clinical attention.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation aligns with major depressive disorder compounded by trauma-related symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The co-occurrence of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms warrants comprehensive assessment and a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",

      "expected": "ptsd",
      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply challenging experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are struggling with ongoing distress related to a traumatic event, which has significantly impacted many areas of your life. You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, alongside emotional symptoms such as <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>intrusive memories</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted by frequent awakenings and feelings of panic, and you\u2019ve been feeling disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. It\u2019s also concerning that you\u2019re experiencing thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and are using substances to cope with these overwhelming feelings. These symptoms appear to be affecting your mood, cognition, and overall functioning, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and substance use concerns\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align strongly with PTSD, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of the traumatic event (the accident), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as avoiding driving and certain sounds, persistent <sym>hyperarousal</sym> like feeling on edge, startle responses, and difficulty sleeping. The presence of <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>emotional numbing</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD. Additionally, the pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and suicidal thoughts indicate a comorbid <med>major depressive episode</med>. The increased alcohol and cannabis use to self-medicate further complicate the clinical picture, often seen in individuals coping with trauma and depression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.\n2. Consider a comprehensive assessment for depression and evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants.\n3. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and, if appropriate, referral to a substance use specialist.\n4. Develop a safety plan for managing suicidal thoughts and monitor for any escalation in risk.\n5. Explore supportive interventions that enhance social connection and coping skills.\n6. Regularly follow up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response, adjusting plans as needed.",
