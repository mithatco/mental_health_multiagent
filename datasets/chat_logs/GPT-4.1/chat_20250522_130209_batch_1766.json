Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a screening tool that asks about various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing, and it helps us identify areas that may need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question one at a time and invite you to respond honestly and in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> suggest a complex mood presentation that may be compounded by substance-related effects.

The intersecting symptoms and behaviors suggest a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity and duration of depressive, anxiety, and substance use symptoms, including screening for suicidality and safety.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy), medication management for depression and anxiety, and substance use treatment/support.  \n3. Refer to a specialist in addiction medicine or dual diagnosis if needed to address substance use issues concurrently with mental health treatment.  \n4. Monitor and support sleep hygiene and stress management strategies to improve sleep quality and emotional regulation.  \n5. Engage the patient in psychoeducation about the effects of substance use on mood and cognition, and explore healthier coping strategies.",

They report significant anxiety symptoms, including persistent feelings of being on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, contributing to social withdrawal and isolation. Sleep disturbance is prominent, with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, often utilizing substances to facilitate sleep, yet still experiencing poor sleep quality. Cognitive concerns are evident, including memory impairment and disorientation, especially during periods of heightened substance use or stress. Intrusive thoughts related to substance use and past episodes, along with compulsive checking behaviors, suggest underlying ruminative or obsessive features. The patient also reports dissociative experiences, feelings of emotional detachment, and identity confusion, indicating possible dissociative symptoms or depersonalization phenomena. They acknowledge engaging in high-risk behaviors, such as substance misuse (including unprescribed medication use, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking), which serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. Risk assessment reveals passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan, alongside substance use as a potential precipitant for psychological distress. The pattern of symptoms indicates comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use concerns, with notable functional impairment and social withdrawal.\n\nKey clinical considerations include mood dysregulation, anxiety symptoms, substance use disorder, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and dissociative symptoms. The patient's presentation warrants comprehensive assessment for mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and potential comorbid dissociative phenomena, with careful evaluation of suicide risk and substance-related risks.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of ongoing emotional distress, substance use, and behavioral challenges that significantly impact your daily life. It sounds like you are struggling with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>detachment</sym>, along with difficulties sleeping, problems with memory, and intrusive thoughts related to substance use. Your experiences of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> episodes, combined with high-risk behaviors like excessive drinking, smoking, and unprescribed medication use, suggest that you're facing multiple interconnected issues. It\u2019s understandable that these feelings and behaviors are overwhelming, and your honesty about these struggles is a vital step toward getting support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>diminished pleasure</sym> align with symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> suggest a complex mood presentation that may be compounded by substance-related effects. The frequent use of <sym>alcohol</sym>, <sym>smoking</sym>, and <sym>unprescribed medications</sym> indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which appears to be both a maladaptive coping mechanism and a potential contributor to mood and cognitive symptoms. The patient also exhibits significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic episodes</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which may point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intersecting symptoms and behaviors suggest a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity and duration of depressive, anxiety, and substance use symptoms, including screening for suicidality and safety.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy), medication management for depression and anxiety, and substance use treatment/support.  \n3. Refer to a specialist in addiction medicine or dual diagnosis if needed to address substance use issues concurrently with mental health treatment.  \n4. Monitor and support sleep hygiene and stress management strategies to improve sleep quality and emotional regulation.  \n5. Engage the patient in psychoeducation about the effects of substance use on mood and cognition, and explore healthier coping strategies.",
