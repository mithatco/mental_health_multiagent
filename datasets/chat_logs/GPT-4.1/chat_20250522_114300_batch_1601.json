Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed mood history and risk evaluation, to confirm the diagnosis and determine severity.  \n2. Develop an individualized treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, psychotherapy (such as CBT or psychoeducation), and anxiety management strategies.  \n3.

There are notable mood fluctuations, with reported mood swings including depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes.\n\nKey symptoms include:\n- Depressive symptoms: anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, pervasive negative thoughts, fatigue despite hypersomnia, and social withdrawal.\n- Manic/hypomanic features: decreased sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, distractibility, and engagement in risky activities.\n- Anxiety-related symptoms: heightened nervousness, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints such as headaches and back pain.\n- Psychotic-like experiences are absent; no hallucinations or delusional thoughts reported.\n- Cognitive disturbances include forgetfulness and racing thoughts, particularly during mood shifts.\n- The patient acknowledges thoughts of self-harm without current plans but expresses feelings of despair during depressive episodes.\n\nPatterns observed include cyclical mood symptoms with intercurrent anxiety and stress-related features. There are also reports of dissociative experiences and identity confusion during mood swings.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance:\n- Mood disorder with bipolar features, given the combination of depressive episodes and manic/hypomanic symptoms.\n- Anxiety symptoms that may exacerbate mood dysregulation.\n- Risk assessment for suicidality, given self-referential hopelessness and passive death ideation.\n- Substance use appears minimal; no current substance misuse reported.\n- Sleep disturbances corresponding with mood episodes.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs:\n- Passive suicidal ideation during depressive states.\n- Impulsivity and risk-taking during hypomanic episodes increase potential for harm.\n- Mood instability with rapid shifts, possibly indicating bipolar spectrum disorder.\n\nOverall, the profile suggests a bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety features. Further assessment, including detailed mood history, risk evaluation, and formal diagnostic clarification, is recommended to guide treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a very detailed picture of your experiences over the past two weeks, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a complex mix of mood and anxiety symptoms. You\u2019ve described episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, often during depressive phases. At other times, you've experienced <sym>elevated mood</sym> with <quote>less sleep but feeling hyper and unstoppable</quote>, along with engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <quote>jumping into projects impulsively</quote>. You\u2019ve also reported significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like <quote>feeling nervous or on edge</quote>, <quote>panic waves</quote>, and avoidance of social situations. Some physical symptoms like <quote>headaches or back pain</quote> seem linked to stress, and there are thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> during depressive episodes. Overall, your experiences suggest mood swings that include both depressive and hypomanic/manic episodes, with notable anxiety and some dissociative feelings during intense mood shifts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The symptom pattern of alternating depressive episodes characterized by <sym>anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue, and social withdrawal</sym>, with periods of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as <quote>decreased need for sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky activities</quote>, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like <quote>feeling anxious, panic, and avoidance</quote> suggests a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> and the episodic nature of mood changes support this diagnosis. Your reports of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and confusion during mood swings are also consistent with mood instability. The self-reported <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> during depressive phases warrant careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed mood history and risk evaluation, to confirm the diagnosis and determine severity.  \n2. Develop an individualized treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, psychotherapy (such as CBT or psychoeducation), and anxiety management strategies.  \n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning, especially during depressive episodes.  \n4. Consider psychoeducation for you about mood regulation, triggers, and coping strategies.  \n5. Coordinate care with a psychiatrist for medication management and regular follow-up to assess effectiveness and side effects.",
