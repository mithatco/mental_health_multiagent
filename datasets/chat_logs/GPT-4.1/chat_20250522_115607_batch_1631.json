This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences without judgment. I will be asking you 23 questions that cover different areas of mental health, such as mood, anxiety, and social functioning. There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just tell me how you've been feeling and experiencing things recently. Are you ready for us to begin with the first question?"

You've also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>socially withdrawn</sym>, avoiding situations where you might feel judged or uncomfortable.

Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, and coordinate with a psychiatrist if medication is considered appropriate.\n4.

They describe significant mood disturbance characterized by persistent low mood, irritability, and social withdrawal, including avoidance of social situations due to anxiety. Anxiety manifests as heightened worry, hypervigilance, and episodes of panic, particularly related to social interactions and perceived judgment. Sleep disturbances are noted, with inconsistent sleep patterns and non-restorative sleep, alongside cognitive complaints such as memory difficulties and feelings of dissociation or derealization when anxious.\n\nThe patient's self-reported passive suicidal ideation, including fleeting thoughts of self-harm, warrants careful clinical attention. No auditory or visual hallucinations are reported, and there is no evidence of compulsive behaviors. Substance use appears minimal, with occasional alcohol consumption and no tobacco or prescription medication misuse.\n\nPatterns indicate co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with social withdrawal, anhedonia, and cognitive disruptions. Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation and social avoidance, which may increase vulnerability to worsening depression or anxiety.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation suggests moderate to severe depressive symptoms with prominent social anxiety features, heightened worry, and dissociative experiences. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts and social withdrawal warrants ongoing assessment and potential intervention to address safety and functional impairments.",

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a range of challenging feelings and symptoms over the past couple of weeks. You've described persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that you previously enjoyed, which can be very difficult to cope with. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>socially withdrawn</sym>, avoiding situations where you might feel judged or uncomfortable. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with frequent feelings of <sym>being on edge</sym> and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, especially in social contexts. Sleep disturbances and difficulty with memory further affect your daily functioning. Additionally, you've shared some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> that are concerning and should be addressed carefully. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex picture of mood, anxiety, and cognitive concerns, which are impacting your well-being and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with features of Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with symptoms of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The social withdrawal, avoidance of social situations, and persistent worry about judgment suggest significant <sym>social anxiety</sym>. The presence of <sym>panic-like episodes</sym> and feelings of being \"on edge\" indicate heightened anxiety symptoms. Sleep issues and cognitive complaints, such as memory problems and dissociative feelings, further support a mood-anxiety presentation. The mention of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> underscores the importance of safety assessment, but no psychotic symptoms or compulsive behaviors are reported. These combined symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> features, though a comprehensive clinical assessment is necessary for an exact diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview to confirm diagnostic impressions and assess risk, particularly regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> and safety.\n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.\n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, and coordinate with a psychiatrist if medication is considered appropriate.\n4. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies or medical consultation.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms to reduce stigma and increase engagement in treatment.\n6. Establish a safety plan, especially given the presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, and involve support systems where appropriate.",
