You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, which suggests a persistent low mood. You also mentioned feeling <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are quite frightening. Your reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> reflect significant impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, along with <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>, which are serious concerns. Your sleep problems and cognitive difficulties further impact your daily functioning. I want to acknowledge how overwhelming this all must feel and emphasize that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with mixed features and active suicidal ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> further support a severe presentation with mixed features\u2014indicating mood lability, agitation, and increased energy despite low mood. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores high risk and the need for immediate safety considerations. The dissociative symptoms and intrusive thoughts suggest comorbidities that might include dissociative features or obsessive-compulsive traits, but the core presentation aligns with a primary mood disorder with active suicidality.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>.\n2. Urgent psychiatric evaluation to consider hospitalization if risk is deemed high and to initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy).\n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation about the impact of <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> on mood and overall health, and facilitate referral to specialized substance use treatment if appropriate.\n4. Develop a comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment plan that includes safety monitoring, therapy targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n5. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and risk factors, adjusting the treatment plan as needed.",

There is evidence of irritability and increased anger, alongside significant sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and fragmented sleep quality. The patient also exhibits psychomotor agitation or restlessness, with reports of heightened energy levels despite sleep deficits.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, including generalized worry, feelings of being on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, especially social withdrawal and situational avoidance. These features suggest comorbid anxiety disorders, potentially social anxiety or panic disorder.\n\nThe patient demonstrates impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors, including reckless driving, substance use (heavy alcohol consumption, daily cigarette smoking, and recent non-prescribed use of painkillers), which constitute behavioral risk factors. Intrusive thoughts related to past mistakes and compulsive checking behaviors point toward obsessive-compulsive features. Additionally, dissociative experiences\u2014feeling detached from oneself and the environment\u2014and feelings of identity confusion or purposelessness are noted, indicating possible dissociative or identity-related symptoms.\n\nThere are concerning indications of self-harm ideation, with explicit reports of dark thoughts about not waking up or disappearing, representing significant suicide risk. The patient's physical complaints, such as headaches and muscle aches, are acknowledged but attributed to stress, though somatic concerns should be further evaluated.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- High levels of depressive and anxious symptomatology with associated functional impairment.\n- Co-occurring substance misuse and impulsivity.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity confusion.\n- Presence of self-harm thoughts indicating elevated suicide risk.\n- Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties (memory issues).\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts.\n- Substance misuse and risky behaviors.\n- Significant emotional dysregulation and impulsivity.\n- Dissociative symptoms potentially complicating clinical management.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by major depressive symptoms, pervasive anxiety, dissociative features, and substance misuse, coupled with self-harm ideation. These findings necessitate a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and urgent safety planning, with a focus on suicidality, substance use intervention, and stabilization of mood and anxiety symptoms.",

Although substance use is mentioned as part of the patient's behaviors, it is not explicitly identified as the primary or a core diagnosis; rather, it appears as a comorbid or contributing factor.

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about what you've been experiencing lately, and it\u2019s clear that you're going through a very difficult time. You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, which suggests a persistent low mood. You also mentioned feeling <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are quite frightening. Your reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> reflect significant impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, along with <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>, which are serious concerns. Your sleep problems and cognitive difficulties further impact your daily functioning. I want to acknowledge how overwhelming this all must feel and emphasize that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with mixed features and active suicidal ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet the criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> further support a severe presentation with mixed features\u2014indicating mood lability, agitation, and increased energy despite low mood. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores high risk and the need for immediate safety considerations. The dissociative symptoms and intrusive thoughts suggest comorbidities that might include dissociative features or obsessive-compulsive traits, but the core presentation aligns with a primary mood disorder with active suicidality.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>.\n2. Urgent psychiatric evaluation to consider hospitalization if risk is deemed high and to initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy).\n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation about the impact of <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> on mood and overall health, and facilitate referral to specialized substance use treatment if appropriate.\n4. Develop a comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment plan that includes safety monitoring, therapy targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n5. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and risk factors, adjusting the treatment plan as needed.",
