          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports experiencing persistent low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. They also describe significant anxiety features, including pervasive worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors related to social situations, indicative of social anxiety or generalized anxiety symptoms. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, alongside reports of decreased need for sleep coupled with increased restlessness and energy, which may suggest a hypomanic or manic component, although the patient's mood appears predominantly depressive.\n\nThe presence of irritability and increased energy, along with avoidance of social interactions, raises considerations of mood instability. The patient reports recurrent intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of disconnection or derealization, which could point to dissociative phenomena or features of anxiety or mood disorders. Additionally, they endorse passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan, indicating a potential risk that warrants close monitoring.\n\nOther notable findings include somatic complaints such as headaches and stomach aches, and difficulties with concentration and memory, which may be linked to mood or anxiety symptoms. The patient denies psychotic symptoms, substance use, or compulsive behaviors.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive symptoms with anxiety features and sleep disturbances.\n- Mood fluctuations characterized by irritability and increased energy without clear episodic hypomanic or manic episodes.\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without active plans.\n- Social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors.\n- Presence of dissociative experiences at times.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation, particularly in the context of hopelessness and despair.\n- Mood instability and irritability.\n- Sleep disruptions and increased energy levels.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of depressive and anxiety symptoms, including persistent low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, anxiety, avoidance, and dissociative feelings. The endorsement of passive suicidal thoughts necessitates safety planning and further assessment to evaluate risk. The clinical picture suggests a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, and ongoing monitoring is essential to determine diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>irritable</sym>, with small things easily upsetting you. Sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty falling asleep or waking up during the night, and despite sleeping less, you feel <sym>restless</sym> and have lots of <sym>energy</sym>. You worry constantly, feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>fearful</sym>, and you've had <sym>panic attacks</sym> especially in social situations, leading you to avoid social gatherings. You've mentioned <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation or disconnection</sym>. You also disclosed <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without any intent or plan, which is an important concern. Additionally, you experience some <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomach aches, and occasional <sym>memory difficulties</sym>. Despite these challenges, you do not report hallucinations, delusions, or substance use. Overall, you seem to be struggling with a combination of mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms that significantly impact your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Episode with anxious features, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> that have lasted for at least two weeks, consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>physical symptoms</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate significant <med>anxiety</med>. The reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> are characteristic of anxiety disorders, and the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms suggests an <med>anxious depression</med> presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> require careful monitoring, but without active plans or intent, they do not meet criteria for <med>suicidal ideation with intent or plan</med>. The dissociative feelings and physical complaints likely relate to the emotional distress and anxiety experienced. This constellation of symptoms points toward a diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder with anxious features</med> and <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, after consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication.  \n5. Monitor symptoms regularly for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or worsening of mood and anxiety.  \n6. Explore additional support systems, including social connections and stress management techniques.",
