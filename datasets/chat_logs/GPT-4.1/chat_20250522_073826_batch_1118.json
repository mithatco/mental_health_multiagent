This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Your responses are confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive environment for you. We'll go through 23 questions covering various symptoms, and I'll ask you each one individually. If you're ready, I'd like to start with the first question now."

Anxiety seems to be a significant part of your experience, with <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of social situations.

I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and panic features, with dissociative symptoms and passive suicidal ideation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with panic features. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> suggest dissociative symptoms that may be related to the overall emotional distress. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the importance of safety assessment. There are no reports of hallucinations or delusions, making primary psychotic disorders less likely. The physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension are common somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants and/or anxiolytics as appropriate, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, teach coping strategies, and process dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medications to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Explore possible physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms and recommend medical evaluation if needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and discuss support systems and coping techniques.",

Concurrently, they experience heightened anxiety, characterized by chronic worry, hypervigilance, and panic attacks, with avoidance behaviors targeting social and crowded environments suggestive of social and agoraphobic anxiety components. Sleep disturbances are prominent, including difficulties falling asleep, fragmented sleep, and non-restorative rest, contributing to daytime exhaustion. Psychomotor agitation or restlessness is evident despite reduced sleep, with reports of increased irritability and emotional reactivity.\n\nCognitive complaints include episodic memory difficulties and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization, indicating possible dissociative features or cognitive impairment associated with affective distress. The patient endorses intrusive thoughts and distressing images, but does not report compulsive behaviors, though racing thoughts are noted. There is a history of passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan, underscoring risk considerations.\n\nPhysical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension are reported, with some somatic complaints potentially linked to psychological stress. The patient denies perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions and reports minimal substance use.\n\nPatterns observed suggest a co-occurrence of mood disorder symptoms (depression, anhedonia) with prominent anxiety and panic features. The presence of dissociative experiences and passive suicidal ideation warrants careful risk assessment. No current substance misuse or psychotic symptoms are indicated.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative features. The combination of mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep disruption, cognitive difficulties, and passive suicidal thoughts necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and safety planning.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist covered most core DSM-5 Level 1 domains\u2014depression, anxiety, panic, dissociation, and substance use. However, several domains such as mania, psychosis, and personality functioning were not addressed at all, and questions about these areas were omitted. Additionally, the coverage of some domains was superficial; for example, the questions regarding somatic symptoms and repetitive thoughts lacked depth or follow-up. The conversation did not systematically explore all 23 DSM-5 dimensions, leading to a moderate score.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Most questions aligned well with DSM-5 criteria, with clear and clinically appropriate phrasing. The therapist effectively targeted key symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation, and sleep disturbance using relevant language. Some questions could be more precise\u2014e.g., asking directly about frequency or severity of physical symptoms rather than vague references\u2014but overall, the questions were accurate and relevant for clinical assessment. Minor improvements in phrasing could enhance clinical precision.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flows logically within the explored domains, with questions following naturally from previous disclosures like anxiety and sleep issues. Nonetheless, there are moments where the flow could be smoother\u2014for instance, the transition from physical symptoms to dissociative experiences was somewhat abrupt. Additionally, the conversation missed opportunities to follow up on certain high-risk disclosures like passive suicidal thoughts, which affects overall coherence and thoroughness. Overall, moderate consistency with some lapses.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid GAD and panic features is generally supported by the patient's symptoms, and the reasoning aligns with DSM-5 criteria. However, the justification is somewhat superficial; it references symptom presence but lacks detailed linkage to specific DSM-5 criteria (e.g., duration, functional impairment, exclusion of other causes). The dissociative symptoms and passive suicidal ideation are acknowledged, but alternative diagnoses (e.g., trauma-related disorders) are not addressed. The reasoning demonstrates a good overview but could be more thorough and explicit.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional and respectful tone, acknowledging the patient's distress and sharing validation (e.g., 'I want to acknowledge your courage'). Responses are generally empathetic, and the environment appears supportive. However, some responses could be more personalized\u2014e.g., explicitly reflecting on the emotional impact of disclosures\u2014to enhance warmth and connection. While responses are professional, they occasionally feel somewhat mechanical or clinical in tone, preventing a perfect score."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a solid foundation in clinical assessment, effectively covering many relevant symptoms and maintaining a professional tone. However, it falls short of comprehensive DSM-5 domain coverage, notably omitting assessment of mania, psychosis, and personality functioning. The questions are generally clinically relevant, but some lack precision or depth. The flow is logical but could benefit from smoother transitions and more thorough follow-up, especially on high-risk disclosures such as suicidal thoughts. The diagnostic reasoning aligns with DSM-5 criteria but remains somewhat superficial, missing opportunities for detailed justification. Empathy and professionalism are evident but could be enhanced with more personalized responses. Overall, the assessment is competent but leaves room for improvement in thoroughness, depth, and nuanced clinical reasoning.",

You feel <sym>numb and detached</sym> from activities you once enjoyed, coupled with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Anxiety seems to be a significant part of your experience, with <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of social situations. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep, waking frequently, and feeling exhausted during the day, are affecting your overall well-being. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, and some <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle tension. You have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, but no intent or plan, and you do not experience perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a very difficult time, and your symptoms are impacting multiple areas of your life. I want to acknowledge your courage in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and panic features, with dissociative symptoms and passive suicidal ideation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with panic features. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> suggest dissociative symptoms that may be related to the overall emotional distress. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the importance of safety assessment. There are no reports of hallucinations or delusions, making primary psychotic disorders less likely. The physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension are common somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants and/or anxiolytics as appropriate, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, teach coping strategies, and process dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medications to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Explore possible physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms and recommend medical evaluation if needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and discuss support systems and coping techniques.",
