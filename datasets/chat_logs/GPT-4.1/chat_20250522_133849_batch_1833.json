No evidence was found for psychotic symptoms or substance misuse, making <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> the most fitting diagnosis based on the current information.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including a detailed history and mental status exam, to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> combined with <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood symptoms and anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n4. Evaluate for potential underlying medical or neurological causes of cognitive and somatic symptoms, and coordinate care with medical providers as appropriate.  \n5.

Anxiety symptoms are evident, including persistent worry (A7), occasional panic-like sensations (A8), and avoidance behaviors (A9), suggesting comorbid anxiety features.\n\nCognitive concerns are apparent, including memory impairment and disorientation (A16), which may warrant further neurocognitive assessment. Somatic complaints such as frequent headaches and stomachaches (A10) are present, possibly linked to heightened stress or somatic manifestations of emotional distress.\n\nSleep disturbances are prominent, with fluctuations between hypersomnia and insomnia, leading to ongoing fatigue (A5, A15). The patient reports feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (A19) and a sense of identity loss (A20), indicating possible dissociative experiences or derealization.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal ideation (A12), with no current plans or intent but warranting close monitoring.

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a complex and distressing combination of symptoms that are significantly affecting your mood, thoughts, sleep, and daily functioning. The feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> suggest a deep sense of sadness and emotional exhaustion. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and <sym>identity confusion</sym> indicate that your experience is multifaceted, involving both mood and cognitive disturbances. The physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, along with irregular sleep patterns, further highlight the severity of your emotional distress. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms are overwhelming, and it\u2019s important to recognize that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, severe with anxious features and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> (as evidenced by feelings of <quote>hopelessness</quote> and <quote>not feeling like doing anything</quote>), <sym>anhedonia</sym>, significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (both hypersomnia and insomnia), and cognitive impairments such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>disorientation</sym>. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> and physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are common in severe depression. The patient's reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling <sym>lost</sym> suggest some dissociative features, which can occur in severe mood disorders, particularly when emotional distress is intense. The anxiety symptoms, including <sym>persistent worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, further support the diagnosis of a major depressive episode with comorbid anxiety features. No evidence was found for psychotic symptoms or substance misuse, making <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> the most fitting diagnosis based on the current information.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including a detailed history and mental status exam, to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> combined with <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood symptoms and anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n4. Evaluate for potential underlying medical or neurological causes of cognitive and somatic symptoms, and coordinate care with medical providers as appropriate.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation to the patient about depression and anxiety, emphasizing that help is available and recovery is possible.",
