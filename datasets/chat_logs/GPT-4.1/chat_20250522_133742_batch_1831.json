Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express what you're experiencing. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I will ask each question, and you can respond honestly and openly, describing your experiences in your own words. There are no right or wrong answers. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

You've described feeling <sym>hopeless and weighed down by a heavy sense of darkness</sym>, along with <sym>irritability and increased anxiety</sym> that make it hard to relax or feel at ease. Your sleep has been disrupted, with early awakening and difficulty sleeping through the night, and you've noticed problems with <sym>concentration and memory</sym>. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>physical pains</sym> like headaches and backaches, and occasional <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these ongoing difficulties are causing you distress and social withdrawal, and that you've had some <sym>passive thoughts about self-harm</sym>. I want to acknowledge how hard it must be to cope with these feelings and physical sensations, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing your experience.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> over the past two weeks. These are supported by reports of <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> (early awakening and non-restorative sleep), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness), and <sym>physical complaints</sym> such as headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> further emphasizes the severity of the mood disturbance. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The coexistence of anxiety symptoms suggests a degree of <med>anxious distress</med>, which is often seen in depressive episodes. While somatic symptoms are present, they appear to be associated with the mood disorder rather than a primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, though physical complaints warrant ongoing medical evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicide</sym> and safety planning, given the passive <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), tailored to address depressive symptoms and anxiety.  \n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation for underlying sleep disorders if sleep problems persist.  \n4. Regularly monitor symptoms and functional impairment, adjusting treatment plans as needed, and involve family or support systems if appropriate.  \n5. Explore additional assessments to rule out other comorbid conditions, such as anxiety disorders or trauma-related issues, and consider referral to a specialist if symptoms do not improve.",

There are notable affective symptoms such as irritability (Q4) and anxiety (Q7), along with somatic complaints including unexplained headaches, back pain, and gastrointestinal discomfort (Q10). The patient reports persistent intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of dissociation (Q17, Q19), as well as cognitive disturbances such as concentration problems and forgetfulness (Q16). \n\nThere is a history of passive suicidal ideation without explicit plans (Q12), which constitutes a significant risk factor. The patient also exhibits social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities and relationships (Q9, Q21). Anxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of heightened worry, physical sensations of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors\u2014particularly social withdrawal (Q7, Q9). No evidence of psychotic hallucinations or compulsive behaviors was noted.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Converging symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment suggest a complex mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features.\n- Sleep disturbances characterized by early awakening and non-restorative sleep exacerbate fatigue and cognitive issues.\n- Passive suicidal ideation warrants careful risk assessment.\n- Dissociation and feelings of identity confusion indicate possible dissociative features or a broader affective dysregulation.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts (Q12) highlight increased suicide risk.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia suggest functional impairment.\n- Chronic sleep disturbance and physical complaints may compound overall mental health deterioration.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits significant depressive and anxiety symptoms with associated cognitive and somatic complaints, alongside passive suicidal ideation. These findings suggest a mood and anxiety disorder requiring comprehensive clinical evaluation, safety planning, and targeted treatment interventions.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a profound <sym>persistent low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure in activities</sym> you used to enjoy, which seem to be affecting your daily life significantly. You've described feeling <sym>hopeless and weighed down by a heavy sense of darkness</sym>, along with <sym>irritability and increased anxiety</sym> that make it hard to relax or feel at ease. Your sleep has been disrupted, with early awakening and difficulty sleeping through the night, and you've noticed problems with <sym>concentration and memory</sym>. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>physical pains</sym> like headaches and backaches, and occasional <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these ongoing difficulties are causing you distress and social withdrawal, and that you've had some <sym>passive thoughts about self-harm</sym>. I want to acknowledge how hard it must be to cope with these feelings and physical sensations, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing your experience.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> over the past two weeks. These are supported by reports of <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> (early awakening and non-restorative sleep), <sym>cognitive impairment</sym> (difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness), and <sym>physical complaints</sym> such as headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> further emphasizes the severity of the mood disturbance. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The coexistence of anxiety symptoms suggests a degree of <med>anxious distress</med>, which is often seen in depressive episodes. While somatic symptoms are present, they appear to be associated with the mood disorder rather than a primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, though physical complaints warrant ongoing medical evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicide</sym> and safety planning, given the passive <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), tailored to address depressive symptoms and anxiety.  \n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation for underlying sleep disorders if sleep problems persist.  \n4. Regularly monitor symptoms and functional impairment, adjusting treatment plans as needed, and involve family or support systems if appropriate.  \n5. Explore additional assessments to rule out other comorbid conditions, such as anxiety disorders or trauma-related issues, and consider referral to a specialist if symptoms do not improve.",
