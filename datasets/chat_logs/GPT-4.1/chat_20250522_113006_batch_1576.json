This assessment is designed to help us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and physical symptoms, and it's a helpful step in figuring out what might be affecting you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The process will involve me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as possible. Are you ready to begin?"

You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>more anxious</sym> than usual, with worries about many aspects of your life. Sleep has been challenging, with <sym>difficulties falling asleep and waking frequently</sym>. You noted having <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, feeling <sym>detached from yourself or your surroundings</sym>, and experiencing <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym> are also present. The combination of mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, along with your report of suicidal thoughts, indicates that you are experiencing significant psychological distress that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a >2-week history of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and recurrent <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>.

The checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts suggest possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>. Importantly, the symptoms are causing significant impairment and distress, fitting criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. No evidence of psychosis was found, and substance use appears minimal, making primary mood and anxiety disorders the leading considerations.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, particularly concerning suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including immediate support resources.\n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical intervention.\n6. Encourage the patient to build a support system and engage in activities that promote social connection and well-being.\n7.

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and heightened anxiety characterized by excessive worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, leading to fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and disorientation. The patient reports recurrent intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive-like checking behaviors, suggestive of obsessive features. Additionally, the patient endorses suicidal ideation, which warrants urgent clinical attention.\n\nPatterns observed include persistent depressive affect, an anxious temperament with avoidance of social situations, and somatic symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension. The absence of psychotic phenomena reduces the likelihood of primary psychosis, though paranoid or fearful ideation related to anxiety is evident. The patient's substance use appears minimal, with no current use of tobacco or recreational drugs.\n\nClinical concerns of note include elevated risk for suicidality, significant functional impairment related to mood and anxiety symptoms, and somatic complaints that may exacerbate distress. The patient's reports of feeling lost and disconnected from self and others suggest potential identity or existential issues, compounded by mood symptoms.\n\nThese findings highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment to determine the presence of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or comorbid conditions, along with appropriate safety planning given the suicidal thoughts.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about what you've been experiencing lately, and it\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a difficult time. You mentioned feeling <sym>persistent sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>more anxious</sym> than usual, with worries about many aspects of your life. Sleep has been challenging, with <sym>difficulties falling asleep and waking frequently</sym>. You noted having <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, feeling <sym>detached from yourself or your surroundings</sym>, and experiencing <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym> are also present. The combination of mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, along with your report of suicidal thoughts, indicates that you are experiencing significant psychological distress that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a >2-week history of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and recurrent <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> further support this, along with reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The pervasive <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts suggest possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>. Importantly, the symptoms are causing significant impairment and distress, fitting criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. No evidence of psychosis was found, and substance use appears minimal, making primary mood and anxiety disorders the leading considerations.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, particularly concerning suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including immediate support resources.\n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical intervention.\n6. Encourage the patient to build a support system and engage in activities that promote social connection and well-being.\n7. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust as needed.",
