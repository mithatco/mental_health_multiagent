These symptoms have understandably caused significant emotional and physical distress, and your openness in sharing them is an important step toward addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features, and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with core symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

Conduct a full clinical assessment to confirm diagnosis, evaluate risk of self-harm, and determine the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use, possibly involving immediate outpatient or inpatient support if risk is high.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med>, focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist to address <med>major depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and manage substance use issues.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and possibly medication, under medical supervision.  \n6.

Sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and early awakenings are prominent, alongside cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and dissociative experiences (feelings of detachment and derealization). Intrusive thoughts and persistent negative ruminations are reported, with some indication of possible mild psychotic-like experiences (e.g., feelings of unreality and being watched), though without hallucinations or delusions. The patient also endorses self-harm ideation, including passive suicidal thoughts, and engages in maladaptive coping behaviors such as increased alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and substance misuse without medical oversight, suggesting heightened risk factors.\n\nPatterns suggest comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable behavioral patterns of avoidance and self-medication. The combination of affective symptoms, sleep disruption, cognitive difficulties, and substance use raises concern for underlying mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, potentially complicated by subthreshold psychotic experiences. The presence of self-harm ideation warrants careful risk assessment.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture indicates significant emotional dysregulation, social withdrawal, and maladaptive coping, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and intervention to address safety, mood stabilization, and targeted psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms recently. You've mentioned persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with decreased interest in activities you once enjoyed. You've also described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym> and being on edge, as well as difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>\u2014including waking frequently and feeling tired during the day. Cognitive concerns such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling detached or unreal have been present, along with intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym>. You\u2019ve acknowledged <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and some <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors like drinking more than usual, smoking, and using medications without medical guidance. You also mentioned feeling <sym>isolated</sym> from others and uncertain about your identity and future. These symptoms have understandably caused significant emotional and physical distress, and your openness in sharing them is an important step toward addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features, and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with core symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> further support this. The report of <sym>self-harm ideation</sym> and significant <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors indicates elevated risk and potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym> could reflect dissociative symptoms related to mood or anxiety pathology, but do not alone suggest psychosis. Overall, the symptoms are severe and interconnected, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, and substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a full clinical assessment to confirm diagnosis, evaluate risk of self-harm, and determine the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use, possibly involving immediate outpatient or inpatient support if risk is high.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med>, focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist to address <med>major depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and manage substance use issues.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and possibly medication, under medical supervision.  \n6. Involve social support systems and explore community resources to reduce isolation and improve engagement.",
