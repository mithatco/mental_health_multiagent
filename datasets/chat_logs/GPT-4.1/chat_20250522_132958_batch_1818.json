This questionnaire is designed to help us get a broad overview of your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself openly. We will go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You\u2019ve also described episodes of intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, along with irritability and mood swings. You mention difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including both trouble falling asleep and feeling unrested, as well as occasional <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself or your surroundings. Additionally, you\u2019ve indicated engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and substance use as ways to cope with your distress, and you\u2019ve expressed thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and require careful attention. Your experiences reflect a multifaceted pattern of mental health symptoms that impact your daily functioning and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder, with features of Dissociative Experiences and Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances align with symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, chronic worry, and feeling \"on edge\" suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as feeling disconnected and experiencing forgetfulness may indicate dissociative features often associated with trauma-related conditions but can also occur in severe mood or anxiety states. The <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors, including alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, raising concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlight the importance of safety assessment. Overall, the symptoms are complex and interconnected, necessitating a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on suicidality and self-harm risk, and develop a safety plan as needed.  \n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnoses, including assessment of trauma history and substance use.  \n3. Initiate or optimize <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and complexity of symptoms.  \n5. Encourage development of healthy coping strategies and provide psychoeducation about mental health, sleep hygiene, and substance use reduction.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",

These symptoms are compounded by maladaptive coping mechanisms including substance use and occasional self-injurious thoughts. Physical complaints and sleep irregularities further reflect the severity of distress. The clinical picture warrants thorough safety assessment, exploration of trauma history, evaluation of substance use, and formulation of a comprehensive treatment plan targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and functional improvements.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and distressing picture of your current experience. It\u2019s clear that you are going through significant emotional pain, with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You\u2019ve also described episodes of intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, along with irritability and mood swings. You mention difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including both trouble falling asleep and feeling unrested, as well as occasional <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself or your surroundings. Additionally, you\u2019ve indicated engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and substance use as ways to cope with your distress, and you\u2019ve expressed thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and require careful attention. Your experiences reflect a multifaceted pattern of mental health symptoms that impact your daily functioning and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder, with features of Dissociative Experiences and Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances align with symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, chronic worry, and feeling \"on edge\" suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as feeling disconnected and experiencing forgetfulness may indicate dissociative features often associated with trauma-related conditions but can also occur in severe mood or anxiety states. The <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors, including alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, raising concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlight the importance of safety assessment. Overall, the symptoms are complex and interconnected, necessitating a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on suicidality and self-harm risk, and develop a safety plan as needed.  \n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnoses, including assessment of trauma history and substance use.  \n3. Initiate or optimize <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and complexity of symptoms.  \n5. Encourage development of healthy coping strategies and provide psychoeducation about mental health, sleep hygiene, and substance use reduction.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
