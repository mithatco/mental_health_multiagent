I'll be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us understand different areas of your mental health and how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to provide a safe, supportive space for you. The questionnaire includes 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including standardized diagnostic interviews, to clarify the primary diagnosis and rule out other conditions.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan to address suicidal thoughts, including close monitoring and possibly involving a mental health crisis service if risk escalates.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with anxiolytic properties, in conjunction with evidence-based psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.  \n4. Address physical symptoms through integrated care, including stress management, relaxation techniques, and possible referral to physical health providers for somatic complaints.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and develop coping strategies to manage worry and panic episodes.  \n6. Schedule ongoing follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

There is a notable history of intense worry, hypervigilance, and panic episodes (Q7, Q8), alongside avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations (Q9). Somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal discomfort (Q10) further support a somatic component associated with heightened anxiety.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are minimal but include episodes of dissociation (Q19) and mild memory issues (Q16), which may warrant further assessment. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors (Q17, Q18) suggest features of obsessive-compulsive tendencies, although these are not elaborated as compulsions driven by specific obsessions.\n\nThe patient reports limited substance use, with no recent alcohol abuse or tobacco use and no misuse of prescribed medications (Q22\u2013Q24). However, expressed feelings of emotional numbness, detachment, and identity confusion (Q20, Q21) raise concerns about possible dissociative or depersonalization experiences, and social withdrawal.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant mood symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness)\n- Elevated anxiety levels with panic and avoidance behaviors\n- Physical symptoms related to tension and somatic complaints\n- Intrusive, ruminative thoughts and compulsive checking\n- Mild dissociative experiences and cognitive difficulties\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Reports of suicidal thoughts (Q12), albeit without plans or actions, indicating potential risk for self-harm.\n- Chronic anxiety and panic symptoms increasing distress and functional impairment.\n- Feelings of emotional numbness, dissociation, and identity uncertainty, which could escalate if untreated.\n- Social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors that may contribute to loneliness or depression.\n\n**Summary in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient exhibits a constellation of depressive and anxiety features characterized by anhedonia, pervasive low mood, irritability, and hyperarousal symptoms including panic attacks and persistent worry. Somatic complaints and dissociative phenomena further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of suicidal ideation, even if passive, warrants careful monitoring. Overall, the presentation suggests a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, with notable dissociative and obsessive-compulsive features, necessitating comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing significant distress over the past couple of weeks, including <sym>persistent feelings of depression, numbness, and boredom</sym>. You've described feeling <quote>really down, like a heavy weight that you can't shake</quote>, along with increased <sym>irritability and anger</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>waking during the night and feeling restless</sym>, and you've noticed physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches, muscle tension, and stomach discomfort</sym>. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance of certain places and situations</sym>. You also mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts, checking behaviors, moments of dissociation, and confusion about your identity and goals</sym>. Importantly, you reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, though not acting on them, and expressed feelings of social disconnection and emotional numbness. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, which are significantly impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and features of Dissociative Experiences</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The pervasive and severe anxiety symptoms, including <sym>persistent worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical tension</sym>, suggest an <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Panic Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative experiences such as feeling detached and episodes of confusion about identity</sym> indicates some dissociative features, which may be part of the broader symptom picture. The <sym>intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors</sym> raise the possibility of obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but these are less prominent and would require further assessment. The patient's report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores the importance of close monitoring. Overall, this constellation of symptoms indicates a severe mood disorder with significant anxiety and dissociative features, which warrants comprehensive treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including standardized diagnostic interviews, to clarify the primary diagnosis and rule out other conditions.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan to address suicidal thoughts, including close monitoring and possibly involving a mental health crisis service if risk escalates.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with anxiolytic properties, in conjunction with evidence-based psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.  \n4. Address physical symptoms through integrated care, including stress management, relaxation techniques, and possible referral to physical health providers for somatic complaints.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and develop coping strategies to manage worry and panic episodes.  \n6. Schedule ongoing follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
