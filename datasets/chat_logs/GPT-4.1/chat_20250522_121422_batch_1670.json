This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and other areas. Please know that everything you share remains confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to be open. The assessment consists of 23 questions, each asking about different symptoms or experiences. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Sleep disturbances are evident, with <sym>reduced sleep duration</sym> but maintained <sym>high energy levels</sym>. There are pervasive <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as chronic worry, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, which have contributed to social withdrawal. Additionally, they describe somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, along with cognitive issues including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>disorientation</sym>. The presence of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> of self-harm, along with recent <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications\u2014raises concerns about coping strategies and risk. The patient also reports feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and identity confusion, indicating a multifaceted presentation involving mood, anxiety, somatic, and dissociative features.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe, with anxious distress and features of mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance), and <sym>sleep disruption</sym> with maintained energy suggests a mixed presentation, possibly with <med>anxious distress</med> features. Somatic complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym> could be manifestations of psychological distress or comorbid somatic conditions but warrant careful assessment. The reported <sym>dissociation</sym> and identity concerns could point toward additional features or comorbidities but are not sufficient alone for a separate diagnosis at this stage. The recent use of substances and thoughts of self-harm indicate risk factors that require monitoring and intervention. Overall, the symptom profile aligns with a recurrent depressive episode with prominent anxiety and some dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history, to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, as well as ruling out medical conditions.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicidal ideation or intent.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., an SSRI), tailored to the patient's symptoms and history.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy options, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n5. Address substance use issues through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized services.\n6. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n7.

Key features include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, alongside reports of pervasive irritability and emotional distress over the past two weeks. Sleep disturbance is evident, characterized by decreased sleep duration and disrupted sleep quality, accompanied by subjective reports of increased energy levels despite limited sleep. The patient also reports significant anxiety symptoms, including chronic worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors in social and specific situational contexts. \n\nAdditional concerns include somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches, along with cognitive disturbances such as forgetfulness and disorientation. Repetitive negative thoughts and feelings of detachment or dissociation are noted, alongside reports of identity confusion and social withdrawal. Substance use is present, with recent alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, as well as use of non-prescribed medications and recreational substances, indicating potential maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nPatterns emerging from responses suggest comorbid mood and anxiety symptomatology, with possible underlying dissociative features and substance use issues. The patient's self-reported ideation of self-harm, although not detailed as active intent, warrants careful monitoring given the presence of dark thoughts. The overall clinical picture indicates significant emotional dysregulation, functional impairment, and risk factors related to self-harm and substance misuse.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a complex presentation characterized by depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety, dissociative experiences, somatic complaints, and substance use, necessitating a comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex array of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress. They report persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, alongside increased <sym>irritability</sym> and emotional upheaval over the past two weeks. Sleep disturbances are evident, with <sym>reduced sleep duration</sym> but maintained <sym>high energy levels</sym>. There are pervasive <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as chronic worry, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, which have contributed to social withdrawal. Additionally, they describe somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, along with cognitive issues including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>disorientation</sym>. The presence of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> of self-harm, along with recent <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications\u2014raises concerns about coping strategies and risk. The patient also reports feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and identity confusion, indicating a multifaceted presentation involving mood, anxiety, somatic, and dissociative features.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe, with anxious distress and features of mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance), and <sym>sleep disruption</sym> with maintained energy suggests a mixed presentation, possibly with <med>anxious distress</med> features. Somatic complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym> could be manifestations of psychological distress or comorbid somatic conditions but warrant careful assessment. The reported <sym>dissociation</sym> and identity concerns could point toward additional features or comorbidities but are not sufficient alone for a separate diagnosis at this stage. The recent use of substances and thoughts of self-harm indicate risk factors that require monitoring and intervention. Overall, the symptom profile aligns with a recurrent depressive episode with prominent anxiety and some dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history, to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, as well as ruling out medical conditions.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing the <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and monitor for suicidal ideation or intent.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., an SSRI), tailored to the patient's symptoms and history.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy options, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n5. Address substance use issues through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized services.\n6. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n7. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions as needed.",
