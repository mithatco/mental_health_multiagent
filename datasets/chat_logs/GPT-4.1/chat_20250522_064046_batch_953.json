Your reports of <sym>hallucinations</sym> such as hearing voices, as well as <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym> about others listening to your thoughts, are concerning and suggest the presence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>identity disturbances</sym> indicate a complex mental health picture. Your substance use and non-prescribed medication use further complicate this presentation and elevate risks. Despite these difficulties, you\u2019ve demonstrated a desire to understand and address these issues, which is a positive step forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, comorbid with an anxiety disorder and substance use disorder (unspecified)**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoia</sym>, such as thoughts of <quote>someone could hear your thoughts</quote>, indicate concurrent <med>psychotic features</med>. The reports of frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance, support a comorbid <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>non-prescribed medication use</sym> point to a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences and identity concerns further suggest a complex presentation that may involve dissociative or trauma-related features, but current data primarily support a diagnosis of depression with psychosis and comorbid substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to clarify the diagnosis, including screening for trauma history and assessing risk for harm.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing suicidal ideation and substance use, with immediate attention to risks associated with self-harm and overdose.\n3. Refer for psychiatric assessment to consider the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic</med> medications, alongside psychotherapy.\n4. Engage in psychotherapy modalities such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy to address mood, psychosis, and substance use issues.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems if appropriate.\n6. Monitor closely for changes in symptoms, especially suicidal thoughts, psychotic symptoms, or escalation in substance use.\n7. Coordinate care with primary care providers to manage physical health concerns and reduce substance-related risks.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Based on the patient\u2019s responses to the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, several salient clinical features emerge. The patient reports pervasive low mood characterized by anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\") and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. Additionally, they endorse significant irritability and increased energy levels despite reduced sleep, indicating potential mood dysregulation or manic/hypomanic features. Evidence of risky behaviors and increased activity levels further support this possibility.\n\nAnxiety features are prominent, including frequent feelings of nervousness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, which may indicate comorbid anxiety disorders. Somatic complaints, such as unexplained headaches and muscle tension, are also present. The patient reports intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences (\"feeling detached or distant,\" \"watching oneself from outside\"), and perceptual disturbances such as auditory hallucinations (\"hearing voices\"), raising concern for psychotic features. The experience of thought broadcasting (\"thoughts are not private\") and paranoid ideation (\"someone could hear your thoughts\") further corroborate psychotic symptoms.\n\nThe patient exhibits sleep disturbance (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep), cognitive concerns (forgetfulness), and obsessive-like behaviors (repetitive mental acts). There are also indications of identity disturbance (\"not knowing who you really are\") and social withdrawal (\"not feeling close to others\"), which may suggest underlying issues related to self-concept or interpersonal functioning.\n\nSubstance use appears problematic, with frequent alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion and daily cigarette smoking, alongside misuse of prescription medications (painkillers and sleep aids) in a non-prescribed manner. The self-reported suicidality\u2014though no specific frequency\u2014constitutes an important risk factor requiring immediate attention.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The symptom profile is multifaceted, encompassing mood disturbances, anxiety, psychosis, substance misuse, and dissociative experiences.\n- There is evidence of mood elevation and irritability, alongside depressive features, suggesting possible bipolar spectrum pathology.\n- Psychotic phenomena and paranoid ideation indicate severe psychiatric symptomatology, warranting further assessment.\n- The substance use pattern and non-prescribed medication use elevate risk for health complications and exacerbate psychiatric symptoms.\n- Suicidal thoughts, even if not acted upon, present significant clinical concern.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Reported suicidal ideation\n- Auditory hallucinations\n- Substance misuse\n- Impulsive and risky behaviors\n- Psychotic-like experiences (thought broadcasting, paranoia)\n- Dissociative symptoms\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient demonstrates a complex presentation featuring depressive symptoms, mood instability, anxiety, psychotic phenomena, dissociative experiences, and substance misuse. The presence of suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation signifies an elevated risk profile. This warrants comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, close risk assessment, and integrated treatment planning addressing mood, psychosis, anxiety, and substance use issues.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing array of symptoms that reflect significant challenges across multiple areas of your mental health. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and a high level of <sym>anxiety</sym>. Your reports of <sym>hallucinations</sym> such as hearing voices, as well as <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym> about others listening to your thoughts, are concerning and suggest the presence of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>identity disturbances</sym> indicate a complex mental health picture. Your substance use and non-prescribed medication use further complicate this presentation and elevate risks. Despite these difficulties, you\u2019ve demonstrated a desire to understand and address these issues, which is a positive step forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, comorbid with an anxiety disorder and substance use disorder (unspecified)**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoia</sym>, such as thoughts of <quote>someone could hear your thoughts</quote>, indicate concurrent <med>psychotic features</med>. The reports of frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance, support a comorbid <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Additionally, the ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>non-prescribed medication use</sym> point to a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences and identity concerns further suggest a complex presentation that may involve dissociative or trauma-related features, but current data primarily support a diagnosis of depression with psychosis and comorbid substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to clarify the diagnosis, including screening for trauma history and assessing risk for harm.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing suicidal ideation and substance use, with immediate attention to risks associated with self-harm and overdose.\n3. Refer for psychiatric assessment to consider the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic</med> medications, alongside psychotherapy.\n4. Engage in psychotherapy modalities such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy to address mood, psychosis, and substance use issues.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems if appropriate.\n6. Monitor closely for changes in symptoms, especially suicidal thoughts, psychotic symptoms, or escalation in substance use.\n7. Coordinate care with primary care providers to manage physical health concerns and reduce substance-related risks.",
