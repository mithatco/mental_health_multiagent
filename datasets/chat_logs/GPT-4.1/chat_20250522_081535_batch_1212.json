Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that asks about various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It helps us get a broad picture of your emotional and psychological well-being and can guide us in planning the best support for you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express how you're truly feeling. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You also mentioned feeling numb and disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your anxiety is prominent, especially around specific triggers like the anniversary of a traumatic event, and you experience episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are frightening. Sleep problems, such as waking early and feeling exhausted despite waking multiple times, add to your difficulties. You\u2019ve described intrusive images related to a traumatic incident, along with memory difficulties and feelings of being detached from reality. Your increased alcohol consumption and occasional smoking suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming feelings. The presence of fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> is concerning and indicates the importance of safety and support. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant emotional distress impacting multiple areas of your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, with anxious distress and trauma-related symptoms (possible PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of intense <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, particularly around driving, suggest prominent <sym>anxious distress</sym>. The intrusive images of a traumatic event, dissociative symptoms, and difficulty with memory point toward trauma-related pathology, potentially <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>. The sleep disturbances and increased substance use are common comorbidities that exacerbate the overall clinical picture. The fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> warrant close monitoring. The complexity of symptoms indicates a comorbid presentation involving mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, requiring comprehensive evaluation and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a full clinical assessment, including a risk assessment for <sym>suicidality</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate safety planning and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Refer for evidence-based psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-focused therapy (e.g., <med>EMDR</med> or <med>prolonged exposure</med>).  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n5. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation and exploring healthier coping strategies.  \n6. Develop a supportive routine focusing on sleep hygiene and stress management.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",

There is evidence of significant anxiety features, notably generalized anxiety (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors, especially related to driving (Q9). Sleep disturbance is evident, characterized by early awakening, racing thoughts, and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), contributing to fatigue and cognitive difficulties (Q16). The patient reports feelings of emotional numbness, dissociation (Q19), and identity confusion or loss of self-awareness (Q20). Intrusive distressing images related to a traumatic event (Q17) suggest trauma-related symptoms, potentially PTSD.\n\nSubstance use appears elevated, with increased alcohol consumption (Q22) and occasional smoking (Q23), which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient expresses concern about not being taken seriously (Q11) and has fleeting thoughts of self-harm (Q12), which warrants careful assessment of suicidality and safety planning.\n\nThe pattern of symptoms aligns with comorbid depressive, anxiety, and trauma-related symptomatology, with notable cognitive impairment and dissociative features. The patient's symptom profile indicates significant functional impairment and warrants comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for suicidality and substance use.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits clinical features consistent with major depressive disorder with anxious distress, trauma-related symptoms suggestive of PTSD, dissociative experiences, and substance use as an attempt at self-medication. These findings necessitate targeted therapeutic interventions and possibly pharmacological management, along with safety planning due to reported suicidal thoughts.",

      "expected": "ptsd",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of difficult and distressing experiences over the past two weeks. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with persistent feelings of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also mentioned feeling numb and disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your anxiety is prominent, especially around specific triggers like the anniversary of a traumatic event, and you experience episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are frightening. Sleep problems, such as waking early and feeling exhausted despite waking multiple times, add to your difficulties. You\u2019ve described intrusive images related to a traumatic incident, along with memory difficulties and feelings of being detached from reality. Your increased alcohol consumption and occasional smoking suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming feelings. The presence of fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> is concerning and indicates the importance of safety and support. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant emotional distress impacting multiple areas of your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, with anxious distress and trauma-related symptoms (possible PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of intense <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, particularly around driving, suggest prominent <sym>anxious distress</sym>. The intrusive images of a traumatic event, dissociative symptoms, and difficulty with memory point toward trauma-related pathology, potentially <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>. The sleep disturbances and increased substance use are common comorbidities that exacerbate the overall clinical picture. The fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> warrant close monitoring. The complexity of symptoms indicates a comorbid presentation involving mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, requiring comprehensive evaluation and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a full clinical assessment, including a risk assessment for <sym>suicidality</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate safety planning and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Refer for evidence-based psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-focused therapy (e.g., <med>EMDR</med> or <med>prolonged exposure</med>).  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n5. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation and exploring healthier coping strategies.  \n6. Develop a supportive routine focusing on sleep hygiene and stress management.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
