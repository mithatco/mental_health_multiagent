This questionnaire helps us get a broad understanding of your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks across different areas. I want to assure you that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive environment for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. We'll go through each question one by one. Are you ready to begin?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms consistent with depressive and social anxiety features, including persistent anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), feelings of depression and hopelessness, and social avoidance behaviors. Anxiety symptoms are evidenced by frequent feelings of nervousness, worry, and physical sensations such as racing heart and chest tightness, particularly in social contexts. The patient reports avoidance of social situations and large groups, which aligns with social anxiety disorder. Sleep disturbance is noted, characterized by difficulty initiating sleep and fatigue upon waking, likely exacerbated by anxiety. The patient also reports recurrent ruminative thoughts related to social embarrassment and avoidance, along with occasional passive thoughts of self-harm, indicating a risk factor for suicidal ideation. No current perceptual disturbances or thought broadcasting experiences are reported, reducing concern for psychosis. The patient denies substance use or compulsive behaviors, and cognitive functioning appears intact aside from minor forgetfulness.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring depressive and social anxiety symptoms, with significant social withdrawal.\n- Symptoms of generalized worry and physiological anxiety responses.\n- Sleep disturbance linked to anxiety.\n- Passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent.\n- Feelings of disconnection or identity confusion are minimal; rather, there is a sense of being overwhelmed and isolated.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts warrant careful monitoring.\n- Social avoidance and feelings of isolation may impair functioning and mood.\n- No evidence of psychosis or substance misuse.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient's responses indicate a clinical presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, notably anhedonia, low mood, and worthlessness, coupled with social anxiety features, including avoidance and anticipatory worry. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and social withdrawal underscores the need for ongoing risk assessment and intervention targeting mood, anxiety, and social functioning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "The patient expresses ongoing feelings of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, describing a lack of interest or pleasure in activities that once might have brought enjoyment. They report persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, including heaviness and hopelessness, particularly linked to social situations they tend to avoid. Anxiety manifests as frequent <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and physical sensations such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>tightness in the chest</sym>, especially in social contexts. The patient also describes <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, avoiding gatherings and large groups, which compounds feelings of isolation. Sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and feeling tired upon waking, are present and may be worsened by their anxious thoughts. They acknowledge recurrent <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym> about social embarrassment and occasionally report <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, indicating significant distress and a potential risk that warrants careful attention. Overall, the patient is experiencing a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and social functioning challenges, which are impacting their overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> features and passive suicidal ideation\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Their avoidance of social situations, along with pervasive worry, physical anxiety symptoms, and fear of embarrassment, support a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates elevated risk and warrants close monitoring. The absence of psychotic features and substance misuse suggests these are not primary concerns at this time. The overlap of mood and anxiety symptoms points to a comorbid presentation, which is common in clinical settings.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, after consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties with sleep hygiene education and, if appropriate, short-term pharmacological support.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression to help the patient understand their experiences and encourage engagement in treatment.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",
