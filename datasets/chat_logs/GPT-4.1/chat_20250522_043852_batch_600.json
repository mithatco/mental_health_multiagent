It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing intense feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym/hyp>hopelessness</sym>, along with persistent <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>. You also described episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, which could suggest mood swings. Your reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, such as hearing <sym>voices</sym>, along with <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym> that your thoughts are broadcasted or overheard, indicate psychotic features. Additionally, you experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and pervasive worry. Sleep problems, such as <sym>insomnia</sym> and feeling <sym>disoriented</sym>, combined with cognitive difficulties like <sym>memory issues</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, further complicate your situation. Your thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>dark ideation</sym>, alongside recent <sym>substance use</sym>, highlight the seriousness of your current mental health state. It\u2019s understandable that you feel disconnected and unsure about yourself and your relationships, which adds to your emotional distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features, possible <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Episode</med>, and comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> with <med>Panic Symptoms</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>delusional beliefs</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> suggest psychotic features that are often associated with severe mood episodes or psychotic disorders. The episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> raise the possibility of a <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Episode</med>. The high levels of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance, point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and substance misuse further exacerbate the clinical picture, indicating a complex, multi-faceted presentation requiring comprehensive management. Given the severity of symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of a mood disorder with psychotic features and comorbid anxiety is appropriate, though further evaluation is necessary for definitive classification.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including risk assessment for <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>suicide</sym>, and consider hospitalization if safety is a concern.<br>\n2. Initiate a treatment plan that may include <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to address psychotic symptoms, and <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> as appropriate for mood symptoms.<br>\n3. Provide integrated psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Trauma-focused therapy</med>, to help manage symptoms and develop coping strategies.<br>\n4. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through specialized addiction services to reduce risks and improve overall treatment outcomes.<br>\n5. Implement sleep hygiene strategies and monitor cognitive symptoms, adjusting treatment as needed to improve sleep quality and cognitive functioning.<br>\n6. Coordinate care with a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatry, psychology, and addiction specialists, to ensure comprehensive support.",

There is notable irritability and increased agitation, alongside reports of elevated energy levels characterized by insomnia, restlessness, and impulsive engagement in risky or goal-directed activities, suggestive of mood dysregulation possibly aligned with a manic or hypomanic spectrum.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are evident, with auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), delusional experiences (beliefs that thoughts are broadcasted or overheard), and dissociative phenomena (feelings of detachment from self and environment). These symptoms point to psychotic features or severe dissociative experiences.\n\nThe patient exhibits heightened anxiety, including panic-like episodes, avoidance behaviors, and hypervigilance, which collectively suggest significant anxiety pathology. Sleep disturbances are profound, with insomnia and non-restorative sleep impacting overall functioning. Cognitive symptoms such as memory impairment and disorientation further support neurocognitive involvement or severe emotional distress.\n\nThere are concerning indications of self-injurious ideation, with reported dark thoughts and thoughts of self-harm. Substance use appears problematic, with recent alcohol overuse, increased tobacco consumption, and non-prescribed medication and illicit drug use (marijuana, unprescribed medications), all serving as potential maladaptive coping mechanisms and risk factors.\n\nThe patient also reports social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and disconnection from interpersonal relationships, consistent with affective flattening or social isolation.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Mood symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness) co-occurring with elevated energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors suggest possible bipolar spectrum features.\n- Psychotic phenomena (auditory hallucinations, paranoid beliefs) indicate a need for thorough psychosis assessment.\n- Anxiety symptoms, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors point to comorbid anxiety disorders.\n- Sleep and cognitive disturbances exacerbate overall functioning.\n- Substance use and self-harm thoughts heighten risk and require immediate attention.\n\n**Risk Factors / Warning Signs:**\n- Active suicidal ideation with dark thoughts.\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid beliefs.\n- Recent substance misuse, including unprescribed medications and illicit drugs.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors.\n- Social withdrawal and emotional numbing.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by severe mood dysregulation, psychotic features, high levels of anxiety, and substance use, compounded by sleep and cognitive impairments. These symptoms warrant comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, risk assessment, and integrated treatment planning addressing mood stabilization, psychosis, substance use, and safety concerns.",

While psychotic features are present, the overall symptom profile aligns more with mood disorders with psychotic features rather than schizophrenia, which typically involves more prominent negative symptoms, disorganized thinking, and less mood fluctuation. The diagnosis does not explicitly identify schizophrenia or its core features, thus it does not match the expected profile.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of distressing symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing intense feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym/hyp>hopelessness</sym>, along with persistent <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>. You also described episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, which could suggest mood swings. Your reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, such as hearing <sym>voices</sym>, along with <sym>paranoid beliefs</sym> that your thoughts are broadcasted or overheard, indicate psychotic features. Additionally, you experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and pervasive worry. Sleep problems, such as <sym>insomnia</sym> and feeling <sym>disoriented</sym>, combined with cognitive difficulties like <sym>memory issues</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, further complicate your situation. Your thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>dark ideation</sym>, alongside recent <sym>substance use</sym>, highlight the seriousness of your current mental health state. It\u2019s understandable that you feel disconnected and unsure about yourself and your relationships, which adds to your emotional distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features, possible <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Episode</med>, and comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> with <med>Panic Symptoms</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>delusional beliefs</sym>, and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> suggest psychotic features that are often associated with severe mood episodes or psychotic disorders. The episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> raise the possibility of a <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Episode</med>. The high levels of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance, point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and substance misuse further exacerbate the clinical picture, indicating a complex, multi-faceted presentation requiring comprehensive management. Given the severity of symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of a mood disorder with psychotic features and comorbid anxiety is appropriate, though further evaluation is necessary for definitive classification.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including risk assessment for <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>suicide</sym>, and consider hospitalization if safety is a concern.<br>\n2. Initiate a treatment plan that may include <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to address psychotic symptoms, and <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> as appropriate for mood symptoms.<br>\n3. Provide integrated psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Trauma-focused therapy</med>, to help manage symptoms and develop coping strategies.<br>\n4. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through specialized addiction services to reduce risks and improve overall treatment outcomes.<br>\n5. Implement sleep hygiene strategies and monitor cognitive symptoms, adjusting treatment as needed to improve sleep quality and cognitive functioning.<br>\n6. Coordinate care with a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatry, psychology, and addiction specialists, to ensure comprehensive support.",
