Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express how you're feeling. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation to rule out any somatic or neurological causes for physical symptoms and cognitive difficulties.  \n3. Monitor for any worsening of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or emergence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Encourage engagement in gentle activities and social support to reduce social withdrawal and improve mood gradually.  \n5.

The patient reports cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties (Q16) and derealization or depersonalization experiences (Q19), alongside persistent anxiety, worry, and episodic panic episodes (Q7, Q8). There is evidence of social withdrawal and emotional numbing (Q21), with noted irritability (Q4) and somatic complaints, including unexplained headaches and back pain (Q10). \n\nPattern analysis indicates co-occurring depressive and anxious symptomatology, with an emphasis on negative ruminative thoughts (Q17) and avoidance behaviors (Q9). The patient also endorses passive death ideation without current suicidal plans (Q12), which warrants ongoing monitoring. No evidence of psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusions (Q13, Q14) is noted, and substance use appears minimal or absent (Q22, Q23, Q24).\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder (major depression), generalized anxiety disorder, panic symptoms, and cognitive impairment. The presentation suggests elevated risk for functional impairment and potential suicidality, given the hopelessness and passive death thoughts. The reported dissociative experiences and somatic complaints merit further assessment to rule out comorbid conditions such as trauma-related disorders or somatic symptom disorder.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex clinical picture characterized by mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social withdrawal, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and tailored intervention planning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult experience, and I want to acknowledge the significant distress you're going through. It\u2019s clear that you're feeling overwhelmed by feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You\u2019ve also described persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and physical symptoms like headaches and back pain that seem tied to your emotional state. Your experience of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym> and difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> further highlight how much your mental health has been affected. It\u2019s understandable to feel disconnected and unsure about your sense of self, especially given the social withdrawal and numbness you\u2019ve described. Your thoughts about <quote>death</quote> reflect deep suffering, and while you do not currently have plans to harm yourself, these feelings warrant careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>depression</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive death thoughts</sym>. The sleep disturbance with early awakening and non-restorative sleep, along with cognitive issues like <sym>memory impairment</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The severity and variety of symptoms, along with social withdrawal and emotional numbing, point toward a moderate episode of <med>major depression</med>. There are no indications of psychosis or substance use contributing to these symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation to rule out any somatic or neurological causes for physical symptoms and cognitive difficulties.  \n3. Monitor for any worsening of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or emergence of <sym>psychotic features</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Encourage engagement in gentle activities and social support to reduce social withdrawal and improve mood gradually.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
