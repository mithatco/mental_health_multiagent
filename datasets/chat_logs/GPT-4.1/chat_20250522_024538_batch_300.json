Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time. You can answer honestly and comfortably.

You've also been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with frequent <sym>worry</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep has been difficult, as you wake early and feel tired during the day, and you've noticed problems with concentration and memory.

Overall, it sounds like you're going through a very difficult time, feeling overwhelmed and isolated.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Dissociative Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty sleeping, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent worry, irritability, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors suggest a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly generalized anxiety or panic-related features. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling outside of oneself or disconnected from surroundings, indicate additional <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The report of <quote>thoughts about death</quote> without active plans warrants careful monitoring but does not currently indicate active <sym>suicidal intent</sym>. The physical complaints may be somatic manifestations of emotional distress rather than a primary somatic disorder. Taken together, these symptoms point toward a complex mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of risk for <sym>suicidal behavior</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor closely.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to target depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Refer for a detailed assessment of dissociative symptoms and explore trauma history if present.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and support systems.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",

They describe persistent fatigue, early-morning insomnia, and concentration difficulties, suggestive of a depressive or mood disorder. Anxiety-related symptoms are prominent, including pervasive worry, restlessness, irritability, and avoidance behaviors, indicating comorbid anxiety features. Physical complaints such as headaches and stomachaches may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nThe patient also reports episodes of panic with sudden waves of intense fear, alongside ongoing feelings of dissociation and a sense of detachment from self and surroundings, which could suggest dissociative symptoms or trauma-related features. Notably, they have expressed passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts about death\") without current intent or plans, highlighting a potential risk factor that warrants close monitoring.\n\nPattern-wise, the presentation indicates a complex picture of mood disturbance with secondary anxiety and somatic symptoms. The absence of substance use, psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or thought broadcasting), or compulsive rituals reduces the likelihood of primary psychotic or obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive symptomatology\n- Co-occurring anxiety disorder, possibly generalized or panic-related\n- Dissociative experiences\n- Suicidal ideation without active plans\n- Physical symptoms linked to psychological distress\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts necessitate safety assessment\n- Feelings of being overwhelmed and social withdrawal suggest potential social isolation\n- Physical complaints may be somatic expressions of emotional distress\n\n**Overall, the patient exhibits a mood and anxiety symptom complex with dissociative features and passive suicidal ideation, requiring comprehensive clinical evaluation and safety planning.**",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging feelings and physical sensations. You described persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and a sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with frequent <sym>worry</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep has been difficult, as you wake early and feel tired during the day, and you've noticed problems with concentration and memory. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches seem to be linked to your emotional state, and you've expressed feeling <quote>lost about who I am or what I should be doing</quote> and <quote>disconnected from others and myself</quote>. Overall, it sounds like you're going through a very difficult time, feeling overwhelmed and isolated.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Dissociative Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and difficulty sleeping, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent worry, irritability, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors suggest a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly generalized anxiety or panic-related features. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling outside of oneself or disconnected from surroundings, indicate additional <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The report of <quote>thoughts about death</quote> without active plans warrants careful monitoring but does not currently indicate active <sym>suicidal intent</sym>. The physical complaints may be somatic manifestations of emotional distress rather than a primary somatic disorder. Taken together, these symptoms point toward a complex mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of risk for <sym>suicidal behavior</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor closely.  \n3. Consider starting evidence-based <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to target depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Refer for a detailed assessment of dissociative symptoms and explore trauma history if present.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and support systems.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",
