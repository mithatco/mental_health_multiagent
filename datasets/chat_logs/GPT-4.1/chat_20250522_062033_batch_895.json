Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a tool we use to understand various areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms, to help guide any future treatment or support. Please know that anything you share is confidential and your comfort and safety are very important. The assessment involves going through 23 questions about how you've been feeling or functioning over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You\u2019ve also experienced <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking during the night and feeling tired during the day, along with <sym>physical pains</sym> like headaches and muscle aches.

You\u2019ve expressed feelings of confusion about your identity and a sense of social withdrawal, along with some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which are concerning.

The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of being outside your body point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can occur in severe anxiety or mood states. The sleep difficulties, cognitive concerns, and intrusive thoughts further support this integrated diagnosis. The presence of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and suicidal ideation, although not acted upon, highlight the importance of safety assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment to evaluate risk of self-harm or suicide, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focused on depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.\n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and consider referral to a specialist if dissociation persists or worsens.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of social support and self-care.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, response to treatment, and safety concerns.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports a constellation of mood and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks, notably including anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and pervasive anxiety with panic episodes. They describe physical manifestations such as headaches, muscle aches, and sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and non-restorative rest, alongside cognitive concerns including forgetfulness and feelings of disconnection or depersonalization. Additionally, the patient endorses intrusive negative thoughts, racing thoughts, and a sense of identity confusion. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships are evident, alongside expressed feelings of being misunderstood or not taken seriously.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The simultaneous presence of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal) and anxiety features (persistent worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors) suggests comorbid mood and anxiety pathology.\n- Symptoms of dissociation (detachment from self and surroundings) and feelings of being outside the body may indicate dissociative experiences or heightened emotional overwhelm.\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive issues (memory concerns) are prominent, potentially exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- The absence of reported risk behaviors or substance misuse reduces immediate concern for substance-related etiologies; however, the mention of dark thoughts warrants ongoing assessment for suicidality.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Reports of dark thoughts, feelings of hopelessness, and dissociation are clinical warning signs for increased suicide risk, necessitating careful safety planning.\n- The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal could contribute to worsening depression and isolation.\n- No immediate evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, nor substance misuse.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex presentation characterized by depressive and anxiety symptoms, including panic episodes and dissociative experiences, accompanied by sleep and cognitive disturbances. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts underscores the need for a thorough risk assessment and formulation of an appropriate treatment plan addressing mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a difficult experience over the past two weeks, feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You've described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, including frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and a tendency to avoid situations that trigger your anxiety. You\u2019ve also experienced <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking during the night and feeling tired during the day, along with <sym>physical pains</sym> like headaches and muscle aches. Additionally, you've mentioned episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014feeling detached or outside yourself\u2014and intrusive <sym>negative thoughts</sym> that come repeatedly to your mind. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of confusion about your identity and a sense of social withdrawal, along with some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which are concerning. Overall, your symptoms indicate a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative features that warrant careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder (possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Panic Disorder) and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, all characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of being outside your body point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>, which can occur in severe anxiety or mood states. The sleep difficulties, cognitive concerns, and intrusive thoughts further support this integrated diagnosis. The presence of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> and suicidal ideation, although not acted upon, highlight the importance of safety assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment to evaluate risk of self-harm or suicide, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focused on depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.\n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and consider referral to a specialist if dissociation persists or worsens.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of social support and self-care.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, response to treatment, and safety concerns.",
