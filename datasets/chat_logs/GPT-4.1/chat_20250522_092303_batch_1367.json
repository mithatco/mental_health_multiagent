It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <med>depressive</med> symptoms such as <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>persistent low mood</sym>. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and avoidance of social situations, which suggest heightened <med>anxiety</med>. Your sleep disturbances, feelings of dissociation or being disconnected, and intrusive thoughts about past mistakes further indicate a deep level of emotional distress. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>medication misuse</sym> adds to the complexity of your situation, and your report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> is particularly concerning and requires immediate attention. It\u2019s understandable that you feel lost and disconnected right now, and it\u2019s brave of you to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (unspecified, with risky behaviors and medication misuse). Possible dissociative symptoms and obsessive-compulsive tendencies also warrant further exploration.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> over the past two weeks. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors (exceeding moderate intake, using prescription medications without supervision) indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts point toward additional features that could be related to dissociative symptoms or obsessive-compulsive features, but further assessment would be necessary for definitive classification. The suicidal thoughts are a serious risk factor and require urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess safety, and explore the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and risk behaviors immediately.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants and anxiolytics as appropriate, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use and medication misuse through integrated treatment, possibly including substance use counseling and medication management.  \n6. Monitor for dissociative symptoms and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and consider referral to specialists if needed.  \n7. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping skills, and safety measures.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-up to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment effectiveness.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, anxiety, and behavioral dysregulation over the past two weeks. Key features include pervasive anhedonia (Q2), depressed mood and hopelessness (Q3), irritability (Q4), and sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and fragmented sleep quality (Q5, Q15). There is also evidence of increased psychomotor activity or risk-taking behaviors (Q6), compounded by heightened anxiety and worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and social avoidance (Q9). Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches, back pain, and gastrointestinal discomfort (Q10) are reported, alongside concerns about health validation (Q11).\n\nIntrusive, persistent negative thoughts related to past mistakes (Q17) and compulsive-like routines (Q18) suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features. Derealization or depersonalization experiences (Q19), feelings of identity confusion or existential distress (Q20), and social withdrawal (Q21) further underscore a profound sense of disconnection and emotional numbness. Substance use behaviors\u2014particularly alcohol consumption exceeding moderate amounts (Q22), cigarette smoking, tobacco use (Q23), and unsupervised medication use (Q24)\u2014are notable and may exacerbate mental health symptoms or pose additional health risks.\n\nThe patient reports at least moderate suicidal ideation (Q12), which warrants urgent clinical attention. The presence of panic symptoms, substance misuse, and feelings of disconnection constitute significant risk factors for self-harm and necessitate comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Mood dysregulation evidenced by depression, irritability, and hopelessness.\n- Anxiety spectrum symptoms, including generalized worry, panic, avoidance, and hyperarousal.\n- Behavioral instability with increased risky behaviors and substance use.\n- Dissociative phenomena and identity-related distress.\n- Somatic complaints with psychosomatic implications.\n- Suicidal ideation indicates elevated risk requiring immediate intervention.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis individual exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety, dissociative features, and maladaptive coping strategies involving substance use and medication misuse. The presence of suicidal thoughts and behavioral risk factors necessitates urgent clinical evaluation, safety planning, and potentially integrated treatment addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use concerns.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed nearly all 23 DSM-5 Level 1 dimensions comprehensively, including depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep, dissociation, suicidal thoughts, substance use, and others. However, the discussion on some domains like psychosis, personality functioning, and obsessive-compulsive features was somewhat superficial, with no detailed follow-up or probing. While most domains were covered, the lack of in-depth exploration in certain areas prevents a perfect score.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Questions were phrased accurately in line with DSM-5 criteria and used appropriate clinical language. The therapist maintained clinical precision throughout, directly targeting symptoms such as mood, anxiety, sleep problems, and substance use without vagueness or inaccuracies. This demonstrates a high level of clinical relevance and understanding.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically with each question building appropriately on prior responses, and the therapist maintained a coherent narrative. There was a natural sequence from mood to anxiety, substance use, and dissociation. Minor lapses in follow-up depth on certain symptoms, such as dissociation and obsessive thoughts, slightly detracted from the overall flow. Nonetheless, the dialogue was generally consistent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, GAD features, and Substance Use Disorder was supported by multiple patient-reported symptoms aligned with DSM-5 criteria. However, the explanation lacked detailed linkage between specific symptoms and diagnostic criteria, particularly for dissociative or obsessive-compulsive features. The reasoning was somewhat broad and did not explore alternative diagnoses or differential considerations in depth, limiting its clarity and robustness.",
        "empathy": "The therapist communicated with a professional and respectful tone, providing reassurance and acknowledging the patient's distress. However, the responses were somewhat clinical and lacked moments of explicit empathy or warmth that could deepen rapport. The tone was appropriate but did not consistently reflect warmth or personalized engagement, which would be necessary for a higher score."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the conversation demonstrates a strong grasp of DSM-5 symptom domains with broad coverage and clinically appropriate questioning. The flow was logical, and the questions were relevant and precise. Nonetheless, the exploration of certain symptoms, especially dissociative and obsessive-compulsive features, was superficial, and the diagnostic explanation, while generally sound, could benefit from more explicit symptom-to-criterion linkage and consideration of differential diagnoses. Empathy was adequate but not notably warm or personalized. To improve, the therapist should focus on deeper probing of complex symptoms, explicit diagnostic reasoning, and demonstrating a more empathetic tone that recognizes the patient's emotional experience more fully.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex picture of your current mental health state. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <med>depressive</med> symptoms such as <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>persistent low mood</sym>. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and avoidance of social situations, which suggest heightened <med>anxiety</med>. Your sleep disturbances, feelings of dissociation or being disconnected, and intrusive thoughts about past mistakes further indicate a deep level of emotional distress. The presence of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>medication misuse</sym> adds to the complexity of your situation, and your report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> is particularly concerning and requires immediate attention. It\u2019s understandable that you feel lost and disconnected right now, and it\u2019s brave of you to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (unspecified, with risky behaviors and medication misuse). Possible dissociative symptoms and obsessive-compulsive tendencies also warrant further exploration.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> over the past two weeks. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>substance use</sym> behaviors (exceeding moderate intake, using prescription medications without supervision) indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts point toward additional features that could be related to dissociative symptoms or obsessive-compulsive features, but further assessment would be necessary for definitive classification. The suicidal thoughts are a serious risk factor and require urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess safety, and explore the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and risk behaviors immediately.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants and anxiolytics as appropriate, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Address substance use and medication misuse through integrated treatment, possibly including substance use counseling and medication management.  \n6. Monitor for dissociative symptoms and obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and consider referral to specialists if needed.  \n7. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping skills, and safety measures.  \n8. Schedule regular follow-up to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment effectiveness.",
