Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand your experiences as accurately as possible. Are you ready for me to start with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a lot about your current experiences, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through significant emotional distress. You mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>sadness</sym> that have persisted recently, along with a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy. Your social anxiety and avoidance behaviors, such as <sym>avoiding social situations</sym> and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> during social events, seem to contribute heavily to your sense of isolation. You also describe physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> related to your anxiety, as well as disturbances in your <sym>sleep</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed moments of <sym>feeling detached</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about your identity or future</sym>. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates a need for careful assessment of risk and support. Your experiences point toward a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and social functioning challenges, which require compassionate attention and tailored intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Features and Social Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly social-specific fears, avoidance behaviors, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> related to anxiety, along with sleep disturbances, support the presence of significant anxiety symptoms. The feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and episodes of <sym>rumination</sym> further align with depressive and anxious features. While there are no indications of psychotic symptoms or substance use, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms points toward a complex mood-anxiety presentation. The <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> necessitate further safety assessment, but they are consistent with depressive symptomatology.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess suicide risk and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation and social anxiety reduction.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if appropriate.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, and explore social support options.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.",

The patient reports frequent panic episodes related to social interactions (Q8), as well as physical manifestations of anxiety such as tension headaches and stomachaches (Q10), alongside sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep (Q15). \n\nThere is evidence of cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including feelings of depersonalization or derealization (Q19), and ruminative, intrusive thoughts centered on social failures (Q17). The patient also reports episodic thoughts of self-harm (Q12), which warrants careful assessment of suicidality and self-injurious behaviors.\n\nPatterns observed include social withdrawal, heightened social anxiety, and internalized distress, with secondary emotional dysregulation. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance use is noted. The patient\u2019s responses suggest significant internalizing symptoms with potential comorbidities of depressive and anxiety disorders.\n\nClinical significance centers on the presence of mood symptoms, social phobia, panic features, and risk factors for self-harm. The emotional distress, social avoidance, and passive suicidal thoughts require comprehensive risk assessment and formulation of an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, and social functioning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about your current experiences, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through significant emotional distress. You mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>sadness</sym> that have persisted recently, along with a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy. Your social anxiety and avoidance behaviors, such as <sym>avoiding social situations</sym> and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> during social events, seem to contribute heavily to your sense of isolation. You also describe physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> related to your anxiety, as well as disturbances in your <sym>sleep</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed moments of <sym>feeling detached</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about your identity or future</sym>. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates a need for careful assessment of risk and support. Your experiences point toward a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and social functioning challenges, which require compassionate attention and tailored intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Features and Social Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly social-specific fears, avoidance behaviors, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> related to anxiety, along with sleep disturbances, support the presence of significant anxiety symptoms. The feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and episodes of <sym>rumination</sym> further align with depressive and anxious features. While there are no indications of psychotic symptoms or substance use, the combination of mood and anxiety symptoms points toward a complex mood-anxiety presentation. The <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> necessitate further safety assessment, but they are consistent with depressive symptomatology.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess suicide risk and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation and social anxiety reduction.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and possibly medication if appropriate.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, and explore social support options.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.",
