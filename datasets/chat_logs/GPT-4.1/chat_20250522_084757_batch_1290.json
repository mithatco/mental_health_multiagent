This is a brief questionnaire designed to help us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express what you're experiencing. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various mental health domains, and I will ask each one in turn. Please answer honestly and as comfortably as you can. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including early awakening and feeling tired all the time, as well as cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. These feelings seem to have led to social withdrawal and a sense of confusion about your identity and future. It\u2019s understandable that managing these overlapping symptoms can be overwhelming, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med> and possible <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a longstanding <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive disturbances such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and episodes of feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from oneself are indicative of dissociative experiences, which can occur in depression and anxiety contexts. The somatic complaints, sleep difficulties, and social withdrawal further support a severe mood and anxiety disorder. While no psychotic features are present, these symptoms collectively point toward a complex depressive and anxious presentation with dissociative aspects. The thoughts of <quote>death</quote> without active plans are important to monitor but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate safety, including risk of suicidality.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an <med>SSRI</med>, tailored to your specific needs and treatment response.  \n4. Explore additional support options, including social engagement and possibly trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed, ensuring safety and overall well-being.",

They also describe cognitive disturbances, notably recent memory impairment and episodes of disorientation in familiar environments. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of generalized worry, racing thoughts, avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, and episodic panic attacks. Somatic complaints include unexplained aches, pains, and gastrointestinal discomfort, which may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nAdditionally, the patient describes feelings of emotional detachment (\"disconnected from myself\") and identity confusion (\"feeling lost about my identity and what I want\"), suggesting potential dissociative symptoms or derealization. Social withdrawal is evident, with decreased enjoyment of relationships and increased isolation. No evidence was found of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs. Substance use appears minimal, and there are no current indications of self-harm behaviors, though thoughts of death are present.\n\nPatterns of concern include comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, cognitive disturbances, and social withdrawal. The combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic complaints warrants comprehensive assessment for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and possible dissociative phenomena.\n\nRisk factors/warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts about death\") without active plans, significant functional impairment, and social withdrawal. While no immediate safety concerns are evident from this dataset, ongoing monitoring for suicidality and worsening symptoms is advised.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety, cognitive deficits, dissociative experiences, and social withdrawal. These findings require further clinical evaluation to determine diagnosis, severity, and appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared a distressing and complex set of experiences that encompass persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations. You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, including early awakening and feeling tired all the time, as well as cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. These feelings seem to have led to social withdrawal and a sense of confusion about your identity and future. It\u2019s understandable that managing these overlapping symptoms can be overwhelming, and I appreciate your openness in sharing your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med> and possible <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a longstanding <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive disturbances such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and episodes of feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from oneself are indicative of dissociative experiences, which can occur in depression and anxiety contexts. The somatic complaints, sleep difficulties, and social withdrawal further support a severe mood and anxiety disorder. While no psychotic features are present, these symptoms collectively point toward a complex depressive and anxious presentation with dissociative aspects. The thoughts of <quote>death</quote> without active plans are important to monitor but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate safety, including risk of suicidality.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an <med>SSRI</med>, tailored to your specific needs and treatment response.  \n4. Explore additional support options, including social engagement and possibly trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed, ensuring safety and overall well-being.",
