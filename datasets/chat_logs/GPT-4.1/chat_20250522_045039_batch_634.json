There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just answer honestly based on how you've been experiencing things over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also notice a tendency to feel <sym>indifferent</sym> and <sym>numb</sym>, which can make everyday experiences feel dull or unfulfilling.

Initiate psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to address both depressive and social anxiety symptoms.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant such as an SSRI, tailored to the patient's overall health and preferences.\n3. Conduct a thorough medical assessment to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could influence mood or sleep.\n4. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and social anxiety, encouraging engagement in social activities gradually.\n6.

There is evidence of social withdrawal, as evidenced by avoidance of social situations and diminished enjoyment of relationships. The patient also exhibits significant anxiety symptoms, including heightened worry, social avoidance, and anticipatory nervousness, particularly in social contexts, with occasional physical sensations of nervousness but no history of panic attacks. Sleep disturbances are present, with difficulty initiating or maintaining restful sleep and associated rumination. \n\nThe patient denies suicidal ideation, psychotic features (e.g., auditory or visual hallucinations, delusional thoughts), or compulsive behaviors, but reports recurrent intrusive thoughts related to social mishaps and a tendency to ruminate. Somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches are acknowledged but attributed to stress and anxiety rather than medical conditions. Substance use appears minimal or absent, with no reported alcohol or tobacco use and no recent medication misuse.\n\nPatterns suggest co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with social withdrawal and sleep impairment being prominent. The patient\u2019s responses indicate an overall low mood, anhedonia, social avoidance, and anxiety, which could be clinically significant for mood and anxiety disorders. No immediate risk factors such as active suicidal ideation or psychosis are identified; however, the pervasive feelings of disconnection and hopelessness warrant careful monitoring.\n\nIn summary, this assessment reveals symptoms consistent with moderate depressive disorder comorbid with social anxiety features, characterized by mood disturbances, social withdrawal, sleep disruption, and ruminative cognition. Ongoing evaluation is recommended to determine functional impairment, potential comorbidities, and appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've experienced a persistent <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym>. You also notice a tendency to feel <sym>indifferent</sym> and <sym>numb</sym>, which can make everyday experiences feel dull or unfulfilling. Additionally, you report <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, avoiding social situations and feeling disconnected from others, which seems to contribute to your sense of isolation. Anxiety symptoms are also present, particularly <sym>worrying about social interactions</sym> and <sym>feeling nervous or on edge</sym>, especially around social events. Sleep disturbances, characterized by difficulty falling asleep and ongoing <sym>rumination</sym>, further impact your overall well-being. You deny <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>psychotic experiences</sym>, and substance use appears minimal. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of mood and anxiety issues affecting your daily functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> with features of social anxiety\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting for at least two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The significant <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym>, and <sym>difficulties in social situations</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported sleep difficulties, rumination, and feelings of disconnection support this dual diagnosis. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal ideation, or substance misuse indicates a moderate severity level, though symptoms are impairing social and emotional functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to address both depressive and social anxiety symptoms.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant such as an SSRI, tailored to the patient's overall health and preferences.\n3. Conduct a thorough medical assessment to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could influence mood or sleep.\n4. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and social anxiety, encouraging engagement in social activities gradually.\n6. Evaluate for possible referral to a psychiatrist or mental health specialist if symptoms persist or worsen.",
