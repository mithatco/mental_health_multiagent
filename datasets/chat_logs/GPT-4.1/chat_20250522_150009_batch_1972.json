Overall, the patient is struggling with mood and anxiety symptoms that interfere with their functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

The physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and headaches, are consistent with anxiety-related somatic complaints. The absence of psychotic features or manic episodes makes other mood or psychotic disorders less likely. The symptom constellation indicates a comorbid presentation of depression and anxiety, which often occur together and require integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnoses and rule out other medical or psychiatric conditions. 2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and pharmacotherapy, possibly with an antidepressant that addresses both mood and anxiety symptoms. 3. Monitor sleep patterns and consider sleep hygiene strategies or further assessment if sleep problems persist. 4. Encourage engagement in gentle activity and social reintegration as tolerated. 5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, and establish a safety plan if symptoms worsen.",

Key depressive features include anhedonia (diminished interest or pleasure), pervasive feelings of sadness and hopelessness, fatigue, sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and fragmented sleep, and cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and disorientation. The patient also reports heightened irritability and increased anxiety levels, with persistent worry, feelings of being on edge, and episodic panic attacks, often triggered by crowded or perceived uncontrollable situations. \n\nAnxious symptoms are prominent, evidenced by continuous worry about multiple domains (e.g., health, future), avoidance behaviors, and physical manifestations such as muscle tension and headaches. There is also a noted sense of emotional detachment at times, alongside feelings of being lost or lacking a clear sense of identity or purpose. Social withdrawal and reduced engagement in relationships are evident, consistent with affective and social withdrawal risks.\n\nClinical significance includes potential major depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety features, possibly with panic symptoms. Sleep disruption and cognitive complaints further support significant mood and anxiety symptomatology. The absence of current suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts is noted, but ongoing distress warrants careful monitoring.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include persistent anxiety, panic episodes, social withdrawal, and sleep disturbance, which may impair functioning. There are no current indications of substance misuse or psychosis.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits marked depressive and anxious symptomatology, with notable functional impairment, sleep disruption, and cognitive concerns. Further assessment is recommended to clarify diagnostic formulation and to inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex blend of emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms that are significantly impacting their daily life. They report persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling down most days</quote> and <quote>no interest or pleasure in anything anymore</quote>. These are accompanied by <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling asleep, fragmented sleep, and feeling tired during the day. The individual also describes <sym>heightened anxiety</sym>, with constant <quote>worry about everything</quote>, feelings of being <quote>on edge</quote>, and episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym>. They mention <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, avoiding social situations and feeling disconnected at times. Physical symptoms such as <sym>muscle tension</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and <sym>stomach upset</sym> are also present. Cognitive concerns include <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and occasional disorientation, especially when anxious. Despite these distressing symptoms, there is no current <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>self-harm</sym> reported. Overall, the patient is struggling with mood and anxiety symptoms that interfere with their functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the ongoing and pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and headaches, are consistent with anxiety-related somatic complaints. The absence of psychotic features or manic episodes makes other mood or psychotic disorders less likely. The symptom constellation indicates a comorbid presentation of depression and anxiety, which often occur together and require integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnoses and rule out other medical or psychiatric conditions. 2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and pharmacotherapy, possibly with an antidepressant that addresses both mood and anxiety symptoms. 3. Monitor sleep patterns and consider sleep hygiene strategies or further assessment if sleep problems persist. 4. Encourage engagement in gentle activity and social reintegration as tolerated. 5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, and establish a safety plan if symptoms worsen.",
