This is a questionnaire designed to help us understand your mental health over the past two weeks across various areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express what you're experiencing. We'll go through 23 questions together, covering different aspects like mood, anxiety, thoughts, and more. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

You also described <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which suggest that your perceptions and beliefs are being affected in ways that feel very real to you.

The fact that you have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> shows how overwhelming things are for you right now, and it\u2019s important that you\u2019re reaching out and sharing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features and significant anxiety symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices) and paranoid <sym>delusions</sym> (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or overheard) indicates psychotic features, which can occur in severe depression. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal symptoms further support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms such as feeling disconnected from oneself and emotional numbness suggest a complex presentation that may involve dissociative features or trauma-related processes. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for immediate safety assessment. Substance use, including alcohol and tobacco, may be contributing to or exacerbating the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, including screening for <med>psychotic disorders</med> and possible trauma-related conditions.  \n3. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), and evaluate the need for <med>antipsychotic medications</med> if psychotic symptoms persist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, including <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> for depression and anxiety, with consideration of trauma-focused therapies if trauma history is confirmed.  \n5. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation and connecting with addiction services if needed.  \n6. Monitor sleep hygiene and manage sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate.  \n7. Ensure close follow-up to reassess symptoms, medication effectiveness, safety, and to provide ongoing support.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. There is evidence of increased irritability and agitation, alongside sleep disturbance characterized by insomnia, restlessness, and fatigue, which may exacerbate mood dysregulation.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal and situational avoidance. The patient also reports episodic panic-like experiences, including fear and sensations of losing control, as well as hyperarousal symptoms such as restlessness and difficulty calming down.\n\nPerceptual disturbances include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid ideation (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or overheard), which raise concern for psychotic features. The presence of dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from oneself and emotional numbness, further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nSomatic complaints include unexplained aches, pains, and cognitive difficulties like memory fog, which are often associated with mood and anxiety disorders. The patient admits to passive SI (suicidal ideation) during overwhelming episodes but denies current intent or plans.\n\nSubstance use appears to be elevated, with occasional alcohol consumption leading to intoxication and habitual smoking. Some use of non-prescribed medications suggests possible self-medication behaviors.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms with psychotic features.\n- Significant sleep disturbances and dissociative symptoms.\n- Passive SI and perceptual disturbances, indicating potential psychosis risk.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia with feelings of identity confusion.\n- Substance use as a possible maladaptive coping mechanism.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation in the context of overwhelming distress.\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid beliefs, suggestive of psychosis spectrum features.\n- Substance use, particularly alcohol and tobacco, which may impair judgment and exacerbate symptoms.\n- Feelings of dissociation and emotional numbness, indicating severity of distress.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, persistent anxiety, psychotic-like experiences (auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation), dissociative phenomena, and self-harm risk factors. The combination of mood dysregulation, perceptual disturbances, and substance use warrants comprehensive assessment and a multidisciplinary intervention approach, with careful monitoring for safety and potential psychotic features.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing and complex set of experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are going through significant emotional pain, with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> that affects your daily life. You also described <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which suggest that your perceptions and beliefs are being affected in ways that feel very real to you. Your experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling detached or numb, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>memory</sym>, and physical discomfort, further highlight the severity of your distress. The fact that you have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> shows how overwhelming things are for you right now, and it\u2019s important that you\u2019re reaching out and sharing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features and significant anxiety symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices) and paranoid <sym>delusions</sym> (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or overheard) indicates psychotic features, which can occur in severe depression. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal symptoms further support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms such as feeling disconnected from oneself and emotional numbness suggest a complex presentation that may involve dissociative features or trauma-related processes. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for immediate safety assessment. Substance use, including alcohol and tobacco, may be contributing to or exacerbating the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, including screening for <med>psychotic disorders</med> and possible trauma-related conditions.  \n3. Consider starting pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), and evaluate the need for <med>antipsychotic medications</med> if psychotic symptoms persist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, including <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> for depression and anxiety, with consideration of trauma-focused therapies if trauma history is confirmed.  \n5. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation and connecting with addiction services if needed.  \n6. Monitor sleep hygiene and manage sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate.  \n7. Ensure close follow-up to reassess symptoms, medication effectiveness, safety, and to provide ongoing support.",
