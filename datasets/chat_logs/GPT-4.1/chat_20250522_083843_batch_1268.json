Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool that helps assess different areas of mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. Your responses are confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share honestly. We will go through 23 questions covering various aspects of your mental health, and I'll ask you to tell me about your experiences in your own words. Are you ready to start with the first question?"

You mention feeling numb and indifferent toward activities you once enjoyed, along with a pervasive sense that nothing will improve, which weighs heavily on you. You also experience significant <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014notably waking very early and being unable to fall back asleep\u2014and difficulty with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. Physical complaints such as headaches and aches without clear cause add to your discomfort. Additionally, you report persistent <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, especially around social situations, which seem to increase your sense of isolation. While you have thoughts about death, there are no active plans or intentions to harm yourself, but these feelings of despair are concerning. You also describe <sym>dissociative</sym> episodes where you feel detached or outside of your body, and a sense of losing your identity or purpose, which can be quite unsettling. Overall, your symptoms are impacting your emotional well-being, cognitive functioning, and social life, and it\u2019s understandable how overwhelming this must feel.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant functional impairment, consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and anxious feelings suggest an anxious component, which aligns with <med>anxious distress</med>. The episodic <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as feeling detached and observing oneself from outside the body point toward <med>dissociative features</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and somatic complaints further support this diagnosis. Although there's no evidence of psychosis or active suicidal plans, the passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful monitoring. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and somatic complaints indicates a complex depressive disorder with comorbid features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and to rule out other conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or another appropriate psychotherapeutic modality to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med>, to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms, with careful monitoring.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if needed, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning, including informing the patient about crisis resources.  \n6. Explore possible underlying trauma or stressors contributing to dissociative experiences and provide tailored therapeutic interventions if indicated.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms of pervasive anhedonia, depressed mood, and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, suggestive of a major depressive episode. They report significant fatigue, early morning insomnia, and difficulty achieving restorative sleep, alongside cognitive impairments including concentration difficulties and episodic memory lapses, which contribute to functional impairment. The patient also describes somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and musculoskeletal aches, potentially indicative of somatic symptomatology secondary to mood disturbance.\n\nAnxiety features are evident, characterized by persistent worry, especially related to the future and social environments, with avoidance behaviors concerning social gatherings and crowded places. There are no reports of panic attacks or psychotic perceptual disturbances; notably, the patient denies hallucinations and paranoid thoughts.\n\nIntrusive, persistent negative thoughts are noted, but compulsive behaviors or mental rituals are absent. Experiences of dissociation, such as depersonalization or derealization, are described as episodic and unsettling, alongside a sense of identity confusion and social withdrawal, which may suggest features of dissociative phenomena or a broader affective disorder.\n\nThe patient denies substance misuse, self-harm intentions, or psychotic features, but mentions passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent. No risk behaviors related to substance use or medication misuse are evident.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n\n- Elevated depressive and anxious symptomatology with concomitant cognitive and somatic complaints.\n- Evidence of social withdrawal and anhedonia, impacting interpersonal functioning.\n- Dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached and observing oneself externally, which warrant further assessment.\n- Sleep disturbances and fatigue appear to exacerbate mood and cognitive symptoms.\n- No current psychotic symptoms or indications of substance use disorder.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without active plans or intent; ongoing hopelessness warrants close monitoring.\n- Dissociative symptoms and cognitive impairments may increase vulnerability to further psychological distress.\n- Chronic sleep disruption and fatigue could impair judgment and increase risk of worsening mental health.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with moderate to severe depressive disorder, compounded by generalized anxiety features and dissociative experiences. The constellation of mood symptoms, cognitive deficits, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal underscores the need for a comprehensive treatment approach, including risk assessment for suicidality, and potential consideration of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions tailored to address both mood and dissociative symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing picture of ongoing <sym>depressed mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that have persisted over the past two weeks. You mention feeling numb and indifferent toward activities you once enjoyed, along with a pervasive sense that nothing will improve, which weighs heavily on you. You also experience significant <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014notably waking very early and being unable to fall back asleep\u2014and difficulty with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. Physical complaints such as headaches and aches without clear cause add to your discomfort. Additionally, you report persistent <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors, especially around social situations, which seem to increase your sense of isolation. While you have thoughts about death, there are no active plans or intentions to harm yourself, but these feelings of despair are concerning. You also describe <sym>dissociative</sym> episodes where you feel detached or outside of your body, and a sense of losing your identity or purpose, which can be quite unsettling. Overall, your symptoms are impacting your emotional well-being, cognitive functioning, and social life, and it\u2019s understandable how overwhelming this must feel.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant functional impairment, consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and anxious feelings suggest an anxious component, which aligns with <med>anxious distress</med>. The episodic <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as feeling detached and observing oneself from outside the body point toward <med>dissociative features</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and somatic complaints further support this diagnosis. Although there's no evidence of psychosis or active suicidal plans, the passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful monitoring. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and somatic complaints indicates a complex depressive disorder with comorbid features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and to rule out other conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or another appropriate psychotherapeutic modality to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med>, to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms, with careful monitoring.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if needed, medication management.  \n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning, including informing the patient about crisis resources.  \n6. Explore possible underlying trauma or stressors contributing to dissociative experiences and provide tailored therapeutic interventions if indicated.",
