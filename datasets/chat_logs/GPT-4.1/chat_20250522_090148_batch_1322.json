I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to identify any areas that might need further attention and to help guide your care. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions across different mental health domains, and I will ask each one in order. You can answer honestly and openly, and if anything feels uncomfortable, let me know. I'm ready to begin with the first question now."

It\u2019s understandable to feel <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>distant from others</sym>, and overwhelmed by <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>physical discomfort</sym>. Your experiences of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>difficulty with memory</sym>, and <sym>feeling lost or unsure of who you are</sym> suggest that you are going through a very difficult time. The fact that you\u2019re coping by <quote>drinking quite a bit</quote> and <quote>using medications without a prescription</quote> indicates that you may be struggling with <med>substance misuse</med> as a way to manage your distress. I want to acknowledge your openness in sharing these feelings and behaviors, and I am here to support you in finding a way forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (possibly Major Depressive Episode) with Anxiety Features and Dissociative Symptoms, with Substance Use Concerns</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>feeling down and hopeless</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>, and <sym>diminished enjoyment of relationships</sym> suggests significant <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The presence of excessive worries, restlessness, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The episodes of feeling detached from self and surroundings, along with reports of forgetting things and feeling lost, indicate <med>dissociative features</med>. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive-like behaviors further supports this. Additionally, the patient's use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications raises concerns about <med>substance misuse</med>. Some symptoms, such as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>physical pains</sym>, may also reflect somatic manifestations related to mood and anxiety symptoms or stress. While a definitive diagnosis requires comprehensive clinical evaluation, current evidence points to a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for self-harm or suicidal ideation, and consider involving a multidisciplinary team if necessary.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and substance use, including resources for immediate support if needed.  \n3. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and mood stability.  \n5. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services if appropriate.  \n6. Encourage regular routines, sleep hygiene, and stress reduction techniques to improve overall functioning.  \n7. Schedule follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood, anxiety, and potentially psychotic or dissociative features. Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. There are notable reports of heightened irritability, impulsivity (e.g., risky behaviors and increased project initiation), and persistent anxiety characterized by excessive worry, restlessness, and panic attacks, consistent with an anxiety disorder or comorbid mood disorder. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with decreased sleep duration despite increased energy levels, which may represent a hypomanic or manic component.\n\nThe patient's reports of intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking behaviors, dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and surroundings), and episodes of feeling lost or unsure of identity suggest possible obsessive-compulsive or dissociative features. Physical complaints, including unexplained aches and pains, may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress or somatization.\n\nSubstance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, with frequent alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed medication use, raising concerns about substance misuse and increased risk for health complications. The mention of suicidal ideation, albeit without detailed assessment of intent or plan, warrants careful monitoring given the context of hopelessness and overwhelm.\n\nRisk factors include the presence of suicidal thoughts, substance use, impulsivity, and dissociative experiences. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished capacity to enjoy relationships further compound concerns about social isolation and deteriorating functioning.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation indicates a complex mental health profile with mood instability, pervasive anxiety, dissociative symptoms, substance misuse, and potential risk for self-harm. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment and consideration of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and dissociative disorders, is recommended for formulation of an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your mental health, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to experience these feelings and symptoms. It\u2019s understandable to feel <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>distant from others</sym>, and overwhelmed by <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>physical discomfort</sym>. Your experiences of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>difficulty with memory</sym>, and <sym>feeling lost or unsure of who you are</sym> suggest that you are going through a very difficult time. The fact that you\u2019re coping by <quote>drinking quite a bit</quote> and <quote>using medications without a prescription</quote> indicates that you may be struggling with <med>substance misuse</med> as a way to manage your distress. I want to acknowledge your openness in sharing these feelings and behaviors, and I am here to support you in finding a way forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (possibly Major Depressive Episode) with Anxiety Features and Dissociative Symptoms, with Substance Use Concerns</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>feeling down and hopeless</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>, and <sym>diminished enjoyment of relationships</sym> suggests significant <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The presence of excessive worries, restlessness, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The episodes of feeling detached from self and surroundings, along with reports of forgetting things and feeling lost, indicate <med>dissociative features</med>. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive-like behaviors further supports this. Additionally, the patient's use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications raises concerns about <med>substance misuse</med>. Some symptoms, such as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory issues</sym>, and <sym>physical pains</sym>, may also reflect somatic manifestations related to mood and anxiety symptoms or stress. While a definitive diagnosis requires comprehensive clinical evaluation, current evidence points to a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for self-harm or suicidal ideation, and consider involving a multidisciplinary team if necessary.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and substance use, including resources for immediate support if needed.  \n3. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and mood stability.  \n5. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services if appropriate.  \n6. Encourage regular routines, sleep hygiene, and stress reduction techniques to improve overall functioning.  \n7. Schedule follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
