Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one carefully.

The sleep disturbance and passive suicidal thoughts further support the complexity of the clinical picture. These symptoms collectively indicate a mood disorder with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features, requiring a comprehensive approach to treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity, including screening for suicidality and safety planning.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant that can address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting OCD and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety reduction, and exposure and response prevention for OCD symptoms.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medications to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and ensure ongoing support and regular follow-up to adjust treatment as needed.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features. Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. There are prominent anxiety features characterized by persistent worry, hyperarousal, avoidance behaviors, and episodic panic attacks, aligning with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder symptoms. The patient reports intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, along with compulsive rituals such as repeated handwashing and checking, consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Additionally, experiences of dissociation (feeling detached from oneself and surroundings) and cognitive difficulties (forgetfulness and disorientation) are noted, raising concern for dissociative symptoms or comorbid conditions affecting cognition.\n\nPatterns observed include:\n- Affective symptoms of depression (loss of interest, hopelessness)\n- Anxiety and hypervigilance (constant worry, feeling on edge, avoidance)\n- Obsessive-compulsive behaviors (rituals, intrusive thoughts)\n- Dissociative experiences during heightened anxiety states\n- Sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, restless sleep, fatigue)\n- Cognitive impairments (memory issues, disorientation)\n- No current substance use or significant risk behaviors such as heavy alcohol consumption or self-harm, though passive suicidal ideation is reported.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance:\n- Major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety features\n- Obsessive-compulsive disorder\n- Dissociative symptoms possibly related to anxiety or mood disorder\n- Sleep disturbance impacting overall functioning\n- Intrusive thoughts with associated rituals indicating OCD severity\n\nRisk factors and warning signs:\n- Passive thoughts of wishing to disappear, indicating depressive ideation\n- Feelings of hopelessness and social disconnection\n- Intrusive thoughts about harm, though no current intent or plan reported\n- Dissociative episodes which may increase vulnerability during stress\n- No active substance misuse or recent suicidal behavior, but ongoing passive suicidal thoughts warrant monitoring\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, OCD-related compulsions and intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences, and sleep disruption. These symptoms collectively suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning addressing mood, anxiety, OCD symptoms, and dissociation, with close monitoring of suicidal ideation.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing a wide range of distressing symptoms over the past couple of weeks. You feel <sym>persistent hopelessness and lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which suggest a significant <med>depressive mood</med>. You also describe feeling <sym>irritable, anxious, on edge</sym>, with <sym>intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm</sym> that lead to compulsive behaviors like handwashing and checking. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you tired despite <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, and you sometimes feel <sym>dissociated</sym>\u2014like you're outside your body or things aren\u2019t real. Additionally, you've noticed memory issues and a sense of being lost or disconnected from your identity and relationships. You mention occasional <sym>passive thoughts of wishing to disappear</sym> but no active plans or intentions to harm yourself, and you do not use substances or alcohol heavily. These symptoms seem to be affecting your daily life and relationships significantly.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness</sym>, alongside symptoms of <sym>excessive worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations</sym>. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive rituals such as repetitive handwashing and checking, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences during heightened anxiety, as well as cognitive issues like forgetfulness and disorientation, suggest dissociative symptoms that often accompany severe anxiety and mood disorders. The sleep disturbance and passive suicidal thoughts further support the complexity of the clinical picture. These symptoms collectively indicate a mood disorder with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features, requiring a comprehensive approach to treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity, including screening for suicidality and safety planning.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant that can address both depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting OCD and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety reduction, and exposure and response prevention for OCD symptoms.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medications to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and ensure ongoing support and regular follow-up to adjust treatment as needed.",
