Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you feeling fatigued and restless during the day, and you\u2019ve noticed issues with memory and disorientation, which can be quite distressing. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed and disconnected at times, especially given the social withdrawal and intrusive thoughts you\u2019ve described. Your openness and honesty are important steps toward understanding and managing these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible cognitive impairment.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The avoidance of social situations, intense worry about social interactions, and physical symptoms like stomach tightness indicate significant <sym>social anxiety</sym>, consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The memory issues and disorientation suggest possible cognitive impairment or dissociative features that warrant further assessment but are noted here as part of the current presentation. The absence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse narrows the focus to mood and anxiety-related diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct comprehensive clinical assessments, including standardized depression and anxiety scales, and neurocognitive testing if appropriate.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and social anxiety.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and implement sleep hygiene strategies; consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n5. Explore interventions for cognitive concerns, including cognitive training or further neurological evaluation if needed.\n6. Provide psychoeducation on mood and anxiety disorders and develop a safety plan if future suicidal thoughts or self-harm risk emerge.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust plans accordingly.",

Additionally, there are indications of significant anxiety symptoms, notably heightened levels of social anxiety (Q7, Q9), anticipatory panic (Q8), and irritability (Q4). The patient reports sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and early awakenings, leading to fatigue (Q5, Q15). Cognitive concerns are evident, with reports of memory issues and disorientation (Q16), alongside intrusive social-related thoughts (Q17).\n\nPatterns of social avoidance and withdrawal are strongly evident, with avoidance of social situations and diminished social connectedness. The patient also reports episodes of emotional numbness or dissociation (Q19), which may suggest dissociative features or heightened anxiety.\n\nNo current suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts are reported, and there is no evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions (Q13, Q14). Substance use appears minimal, with no reported alcohol or tobacco use and no misuse of medications or illicit drugs.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive disorder with prominent anhedonia, hopelessness, and psychomotor disturbance.\n- Social anxiety disorder or social phobia, given avoidance behaviors and anxiety symptoms.\n- Possible comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, given pervasive worry and physical anxiety symptoms.\n- Cognitive impairments, including memory issues and disorientation, warranting further assessment.\n- Sleep disturbance as a significant contributor to overall functional impairment.\n- Dissociative symptoms or depersonalization experiences.\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs include:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal, which may elevate risk for worsening depression.\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociation, which require monitoring for escalation.\n- No current suicidal ideation reported, but ongoing depression and anxiety symptoms necessitate close observation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex profile of depressive and anxiety symptoms, notably social anxiety, cognitive difficulties, and sleep disturbances. The symptomatology suggests the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to clarify mood, anxiety, and cognitive domains, and to formulate an appropriate treatment plan targeting these interconnected issues.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional distress, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy, and significant <sym>social anxiety</sym> that leads to avoidance of social situations. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you feeling fatigued and restless during the day, and you\u2019ve noticed issues with memory and disorientation, which can be quite distressing. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed and disconnected at times, especially given the social withdrawal and intrusive thoughts you\u2019ve described. Your openness and honesty are important steps toward understanding and managing these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible cognitive impairment.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The avoidance of social situations, intense worry about social interactions, and physical symptoms like stomach tightness indicate significant <sym>social anxiety</sym>, consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The memory issues and disorientation suggest possible cognitive impairment or dissociative features that warrant further assessment but are noted here as part of the current presentation. The absence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse narrows the focus to mood and anxiety-related diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct comprehensive clinical assessments, including standardized depression and anxiety scales, and neurocognitive testing if appropriate.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and social anxiety.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and implement sleep hygiene strategies; consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n5. Explore interventions for cognitive concerns, including cognitive training or further neurological evaluation if needed.\n6. Provide psychoeducation on mood and anxiety disorders and develop a safety plan if future suicidal thoughts or self-harm risk emerge.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust plans accordingly.",
