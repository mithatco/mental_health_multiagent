Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, energy, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I'd like you to respond openly and naturally.

Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess risk and explore potential diagnoses more fully.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) targeting mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with efficacy for both depression and anxiety, after a thorough medical review.  \n4. Monitor for any increase in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms, and establish a safety plan.  \n5. Address sleep issues with behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and discuss social support options.",

There is evidence of mood disturbance characterized by persistent sadness, irritability, and increased emotional reactivity. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including generalized worry, social anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, as well as episodic panic-like symptoms in social or unfamiliar settings. The patient experiences sleep disturbances marked by frequent nocturnal awakenings and non-restorative sleep, coupled with reports of cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments.\n\nIntrusive and ruminative thoughts related to social embarrassment are noted, with some endorsement of passive suicidal ideation, though without active planning or intent. Physical complaints include headaches and stomachaches, which the patient attributes to stress. There are no reported psychotic symptoms, dissociation, or perceptual disturbances. The patient denies substance misuse or problematic use of prescribed medications.\n\nPatterns indicate a significant mood disorder with concurrent anxiety features, social withdrawal, and somatic concerns. The presence of hopelessness, passive suicidal thoughts, and social avoidance warrants careful risk assessment. The combination of emotional dysregulation, sleep disruption, cognitive concerns, and social impairment suggests a complex clinical presentation that merits further comprehensive evaluation for mood and anxiety disorders, with attention to suicide risk and functional impairment.\n\nOverall, the patient's symptom profile reflects moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, with notable psychosocial impairment and some warning signs of increased risk for self-harm behaviors.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared feelings of pervasive <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a notable loss of interest in activities that once brought you pleasure. You\u2019ve also described experiencing increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially in social situations, leading to avoidance, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as frequent awakenings and feeling tired despite sleep, along with cognitive concerns like forgetfulness and disorientation, are affecting your daily functioning. You\u2019ve mentioned intrusive thoughts related to social embarrassment and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> when overwhelmed. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches seem linked to stress, and you report feeling lonely and disconnected from others. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns, which are significantly impairing your quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's longstanding <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and persistent low mood over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, social avoidance, and panic-like episodes suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disruptions, cognitive difficulties, and somatic complaints further support this multifaceted mood and anxiety presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate risk but do not currently involve active planning, warranting close monitoring. No psychotic symptoms or substance misuse are reported, and physical health concerns seem stress-related rather than indicative of another primary medical condition. Overall, the symptoms point toward a depressive disorder with significant anxiety features, contributing to distress and functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess risk and explore potential diagnoses more fully.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) targeting mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with efficacy for both depression and anxiety, after a thorough medical review.  \n4. Monitor for any increase in <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms, and establish a safety plan.  \n5. Address sleep issues with behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and discuss social support options.",
