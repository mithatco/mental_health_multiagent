I'll be using a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a tool that helps us get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. The questionnaire has 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, and other symptoms. I will ask you each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly based on how you've felt. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a wide range of challenging symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You mentioned feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a persistent sense of being stuck in a dark place. You've also noticed <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014sleeping very little but still feeling restless and energetic. Your impulsivity has led to taking more risks and engaging in behaviors like impulsive spending. Anxiety has been a major concern, with feelings of <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, including episodes where your heart pounds and you feel overwhelmed. You also reported <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feeling detached, and difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>physical pains</sym> and poor sleep quality, feeling exhausted during the day. You have had some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm but have not acted on them. You've also used alcohol to cope at times. Overall, these symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood disturbances, anxiety, dissociation, and some risky behaviors, which require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and thoughts of <quote>it would be easier if I just didn't wake up</quote> suggest a significant <med>depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>increased energy</sym>, and <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym> may point toward <med/hypomanic symptoms>, but current mood appears predominantly low, indicating a depressive episode. The high levels of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of crowded places</sym> are consistent with <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder or Agoraphobia>. The <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feeling <sym>detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>unexplained memory lapses</sym>, suggest dissociative features that may be comorbid or part of a broader trauma-related response. Substance use (alcohol) appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than a primary disorder. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and risk behaviors indicates a complex clinical picture that warrants a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed neuropsychiatric assessment to evaluate the severity of depressive, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including screening for trauma history.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for any escalation of <sym>self-harm risk</sym>.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, tailored to the patient's specific symptoms and history.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, dissociation, and coping strategies.  \n5. Refer to a specialist (psychiatrist or trauma specialist) if symptoms of dissociation or mood instability persist or worsen.  \n6. Encourage reduction or abstinence from alcohol and other maladaptive coping behaviors, with support from addiction services if needed.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor progress, treatment adherence, and safety.",

Key concerns include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation without current intent or plan, suggestive of moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, the patient reports heightened irritability, increased energy levels with decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors, raising concern for potential mood dysregulation or hypomanic episodes.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by persistent worry, panic episodes with somatic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, shortness of breath), and avoidance behaviors, particularly of crowded or unfamiliar settings, consistent with panic or agoraphobic tendencies. The presence of intrusive, distressing thoughts, compulsive checking, and feelings of dissociation (depersonalization and derealization) suggest comorbid obsessive-compulsive or dissociative features.\n\nSomatic complaints include unexplained aches, pains, and sleep disturbances marked by fragmentation and exhaustion, which may be psychosomatic or linked to mood and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive issues such as memory lapses and disorientation in familiar environments add to concerns about neurocognitive impairment or heightened dissociative states.\n\nSubstance use appears to be used as a maladaptive coping mechanism, evidenced by episodes of alcohol consumption for self-medication. No current use of tobacco or illicit drugs reported.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, recent substance use for relief, dissociative experiences, and withdrawal from social connections, which warrant careful monitoring for escalation of suicidality or self-harm risk.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation involving mood disturbance, anxiety, dissociative symptoms, sleep disruption, and maladaptive coping strategies, indicating a need for comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention to address potential mood, anxiety, and dissociative disorders.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a wide range of challenging symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You mentioned feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a persistent sense of being stuck in a dark place. You've also noticed <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014sleeping very little but still feeling restless and energetic. Your impulsivity has led to taking more risks and engaging in behaviors like impulsive spending. Anxiety has been a major concern, with feelings of <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, including episodes where your heart pounds and you feel overwhelmed. You also reported <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feeling detached, and difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>physical pains</sym> and poor sleep quality, feeling exhausted during the day. You have had some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm but have not acted on them. You've also used alcohol to cope at times. Overall, these symptoms suggest a complex presentation involving mood disturbances, anxiety, dissociation, and some risky behaviors, which require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and thoughts of <quote>it would be easier if I just didn't wake up</quote> suggest a significant <med>depressive disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>increased energy</sym>, and <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym> may point toward <med/hypomanic symptoms>, but current mood appears predominantly low, indicating a depressive episode. The high levels of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of crowded places</sym> are consistent with <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly Panic Disorder or Agoraphobia>. The <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feeling <sym>detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>unexplained memory lapses</sym>, suggest dissociative features that may be comorbid or part of a broader trauma-related response. Substance use (alcohol) appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than a primary disorder. The combination of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and risk behaviors indicates a complex clinical picture that warrants a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a detailed neuropsychiatric assessment to evaluate the severity of depressive, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including screening for trauma history.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for any escalation of <sym>self-harm risk</sym>.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, tailored to the patient's specific symptoms and history.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, dissociation, and coping strategies.  \n5. Refer to a specialist (psychiatrist or trauma specialist) if symptoms of dissociation or mood instability persist or worsen.  \n6. Encourage reduction or abstinence from alcohol and other maladaptive coping behaviors, with support from addiction services if needed.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor progress, treatment adherence, and safety.",
