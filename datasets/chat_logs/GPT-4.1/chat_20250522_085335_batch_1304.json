We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which helps us understand different aspects of your mental health.

Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various mental health domains. I'll ask each question one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready? Great, let's begin with the first question."

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q2), persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness (Q3), and marked irritability and irritability (Q4). These symptoms are compounded by sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating sleep, non-restorative sleep, and fatigue (Q5, Q15). The patient reports significant levels of generalized anxiety, with persistent worry across multiple domains, restlessness, and episodic panic attacks (Q7, Q8). Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal are evident, likely related to anxiety and emotional distress (Q9, Q20). Somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal discomfort are noted, often associated with heightened anxiety (Q10). Cognitive concerns include episodic memory difficulties and disorientation during stress (Q16).\n\nPatterns suggest comorbid depressive and anxiety symptomatology, with notable psychomotor agitation or tension, intrusive negative thoughts, and compulsive checking behaviors (Q17, Q18). The patient's insight into their emotional state appears intact, and there is no current evidence of suicidal ideation or psychotic features.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and possibly health-related anxieties. The patient exhibits risk factors such as significant functional impairment, social withdrawal, and episodic panic symptoms, but no immediate indications of self-harm or substance misuse.\n\nOverall, this assessment underscores a complex presentation characterized by mood disturbance, severe anxiety, somatic complaints, and cognitive disruptions, warranting comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and tailored intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex constellation of emotional and physical symptoms that significantly impact their daily functioning. They describe persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling down most days</quote> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities they once enjoyed. Additionally, they report ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <quote>constant worry</quote>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and <quote>panic episodes</quote>. Their sleep disturbances\u2014difficulty falling asleep, feeling non-rested despite less sleep, and frequent waking\u2014further exacerbate their distress. The patient also mentions somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>muscle tension</sym>, and <sym>stomachaches</sym> linked to heightened anxiety. Cognitive issues such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <quote>lost about their future</quote> are present, along with behaviors like <sym>checking routines</sym> to manage anxiety. They report social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection from loved ones, along with intrusive negative thoughts. Importantly, they deny thoughts of self-harm or substance misuse, but their symptoms suggest a significant mental health concern requiring attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and functional impairment align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, and intrusive thoughts further reinforce this assessment. The absence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, <sym>psychotic features</sym>, or substance misuse suggests these are not currently complicating factors. The pattern of symptoms indicates a comorbid presentation of depression and generalized anxiety, warranting integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on managing negative thoughts, anxiety, and mood symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, short-term pharmacologic interventions.  \n5. Monitor for changes in mood, anxiety levels, and any emergence of suicidal thoughts or other concerning symptoms.  \n6. Explore social supports and consider involving family or support systems as appropriate.",
