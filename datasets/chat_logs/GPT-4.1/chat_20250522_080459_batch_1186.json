Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to get a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you may be experiencing, to help guide your care. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, and others. I will ask you each question one at a time, and you can answer in your own words.

Somatic complaints such as headaches and chest tightness are reported, with acknowledgment of perceived invalidation of physical symptoms. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory difficulties and dissociative experiences, coupled with intrusive, distressing thoughts and mild compulsive checking behaviors. The patient also reports identity confusion and social withdrawal, indicating possible disturbances in self-concept and interpersonal functioning.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable psychomotor agitation and irritability. Substance use appears to be utilized as a maladaptive coping mechanism, with recent increased smoking and non-prescribed medication use, potentially heightening clinical risk.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include active suicidal ideation with thoughts of self-harm, recent substance use, dissociation, and avoidance behaviors. The presence of panic attacks and physical symptom preoccupations further contribute to clinical concern.\n\nOverall, the patient's symptomatology suggests a complex presentation involving mood disorder features, anxiety pathology, and dissociative phenomena, with significant functional impairment and safety considerations. Further comprehensive assessment is warranted to clarify diagnostic formulation and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a complex array of emotional and physical symptoms. You feel <sym>persistent sadness and loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and feelings of being <quote>lost about what I want or who I am anymore</quote>. You also described significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of situations</sym> that trigger these feelings. Additionally, you experience <sym>physical discomfort</sym> such as headaches and chest tightness, and have concerns that your symptoms are not always acknowledged by others. You mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and some <sym>memory difficulties</sym>. Your recent use of substances like increased smoking and non-prescribed medications suggests you may be using these as coping mechanisms. Importantly, you have reported <sym>active suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is a serious concern requiring attention. Overall, your presentation indicates a distressing mixture of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic symptoms impacting your daily functioning and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder (possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and dissociative features, with active suicidal ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, memory issues, and intrusive thoughts suggest dissociative phenomena that may be secondary to mood and anxiety symptoms or a comorbid dissociative process. The presence of <sym>active suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitates immediate clinical attention. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Given the complexity and overlap of symptoms, this provisional diagnosis reflects the most prominent clinical features, but further assessment is necessary to clarify the full diagnostic picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan addressing active suicidal thoughts.\n2. Referral to a mental health specialist for comprehensive evaluation and possible initiation of evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and medication management.\n3. Consider medical evaluation to rule out any physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms.\n4. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, substance use, and risk factors, with adjustments to treatment as necessary.\n5. Supportive therapeutic interventions to address feelings of identity confusion, dissociation, and social withdrawal.\n6. Coordination with primary care providers to ensure integrated care for physical and mental health needs.",
