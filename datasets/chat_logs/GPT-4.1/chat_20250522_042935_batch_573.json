We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which helps us get an overall understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment is designed to be confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. I will be asking you 23 questions, one at a time, about different areas of your mental health. Please answer honestly and openly, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.

You also notice increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep difficulties</sym> such as trouble falling asleep and feeling restless upon waking. You mentioned engaging in <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> and <sym>risky activities</sym>, along with ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Additionally, you experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, which lead to compulsive actions like <sym>hand-washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym>. You also describe episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself or your surroundings, and sometimes feel <sym>lost or uncertain</sym> about your identity or what you want in life. These symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal and a sense of disconnection from your relationships. Your openness about these experiences is important, and I want to acknowledge the difficulty of managing such a complex array of symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features, and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest and pleasure</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors such as <sym>hand-washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym>, point toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, including feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from oneself and surroundings and identity confusion, indicate dissociative experiences that often co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders. Although there are some somatic complaints, they appear to be more related to psychological distress than primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The overall symptom pattern suggests a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan that includes pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and exposure techniques for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and consider trauma-informed therapy if appropriate.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote>, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.",

Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and depressive affect, alongside persistent anxiety, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors. The patient reports sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration, difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns include memory difficulties and episodes of dissociation, such as depersonalization or derealization. Intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors like hand-washing and checking, suggest obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. The patient also experiences episodic panic attacks, social withdrawal, and feelings of identity confusion or loss of self-awareness.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a constellation of mood dysregulation, heightened anxiety, and compulsive tendencies, with significant functional impairment manifesting as social withdrawal and activity avoidance. The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors indicates possible comorbid obsessive-compulsive features. Dissociative experiences and identity disturbances warrant further assessment.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and dissociative symptoms. The report of fleeting suicidal thoughts necessitates ongoing risk assessment, though no intent or plan is indicated. The patient\u2019s symptom profile warrants comprehensive evaluation for mood, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, with attention to safety planning and potential need for targeted interventions.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a profound sense of <sym>numbness and detachment</sym> from activities you once enjoyed, along with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness and sadness</sym>. You also notice increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep difficulties</sym> such as trouble falling asleep and feeling restless upon waking. You mentioned engaging in <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> and <sym>risky activities</sym>, along with ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Additionally, you experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, which lead to compulsive actions like <sym>hand-washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym>. You also describe episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself or your surroundings, and sometimes feel <sym>lost or uncertain</sym> about your identity or what you want in life. These symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal and a sense of disconnection from your relationships. Your openness about these experiences is important, and I want to acknowledge the difficulty of managing such a complex array of symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features, and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest and pleasure</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors such as <sym>hand-washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym>, point toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, including feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from oneself and surroundings and identity confusion, indicate dissociative experiences that often co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders. Although there are some somatic complaints, they appear to be more related to psychological distress than primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The overall symptom pattern suggests a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan that includes pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and exposure techniques for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and consider trauma-informed therapy if appropriate.  \n5. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote>, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.",
