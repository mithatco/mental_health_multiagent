Anxiety symptoms are notably severe, with reports of constant nervousness, physical tension, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors in response to social and crowded situations, suggesting significant social anxiety or generalized anxiety features.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are evident, including feelings of derealization or depersonalization, and recent memory difficulties. The patient reports intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors, indicative of obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Additionally, there are indications of emotional numbness, self-questioning, and social withdrawal, which may reflect mood dysregulation and social isolation.\n\nThe patient admits to thoughts of self-harm, specifically wishing to escape or disappear, although no intent or plan is described. No current substance misuse is reported, and there is no evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, sleep issues)\n- Severe anxiety with panic and avoidance behaviors\n- Intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggesting obsessive-compulsive features\n- Dissociative experiences (derealization/depersonalization)\n- Suicidal ideation without explicit plan or intent\n- Cognitive complaints including forgetfulness and disorientation\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Endorsement of dark thoughts and feelings of wanting to disappear raises concern for suicidality, warranting immediate safety assessment.\n- Anxiety and panic symptoms may impair functioning and increase distress.\n- Cognitive disturbances and dissociative feelings could suggest underlying trauma or dissociative processes.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis presentation indicates a complex clinical picture with overlapping mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation necessitates urgent safety evaluation and potentially immediate intervention. Further comprehensive assessment is essential to delineate diagnostic formulations, assess risk, and inform targeted treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience marked by pervasive <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that once brought pleasure, and persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've mentioned difficulty sleeping, feeling restless, and racing thoughts that interfere with rest and focus. The anxiety symptoms you described\u2014constant <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations\u2014appear to significantly impact your daily life. Additionally, you have reported <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, and episodes of <sym>self-doubt</sym> and <sym>dark thoughts</sym>. Your experiences of social withdrawal and cognitive fog further indicate a complex and severe emotional distress that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder, with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Features, and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes key features of <med>major depression</med>, such as <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances. The severity and chronicity of these symptoms suggest a major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>constant anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors align with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The repetitive checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts indicate <med>obsessive-compulsive tendencies</med>. The reports of <sym>derealization/depersonalization</sym> and memory issues point toward dissociative aspects or cognitive impairment associated with severe emotional distress. The <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wanting to escape or disappear, coupled with the absence of a specific plan, raise concerns for <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> that requires immediate safety evaluation. Overall, these symptoms reflect a complex, comorbid presentation that merits integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct an urgent safety assessment to evaluate suicide risk and determine if immediate intervention or hospitalization is necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to refine the diagnosis and consider pharmacological treatment for depression and anxiety.  \n3. Refer the patient to a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist, for medication management and to a therapist experienced in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed care.  \n4. Develop a safety plan, including crisis resources and support systems, to address passive suicidal thoughts.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive therapy to address feelings of social disconnection, cognitive fog, and emotional regulation.  \n6. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
