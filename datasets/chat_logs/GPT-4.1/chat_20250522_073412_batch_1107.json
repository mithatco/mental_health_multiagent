It sounds like you are going through significant mood swings, with periods of deep depression characterized by <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, as well as episodes of elevated energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors during high phases. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociation</sym> and moments of <sym>identity confusion</sym> during intense mood states, along with sleep disturbances\u2014sleeping too much when depressed and very little when manic. Additionally, you've expressed concerns about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>, and fluctuations in your anxiety levels, which sometimes lead you to avoid certain situations. Substance use, such as alcohol and cigarettes, also appears to be part of your coping pattern. Your openness about these experiences is important and shows your willingness to seek understanding and help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (likely bipolar II disorder or other mood disorder with mixed features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates significant mood variability characterized by depressive episodes with persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, alongside hypomanic or manic features such as <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and heightened energy. The presence of dissociative symptoms during mood swings and episodic mood states supports a diagnosis of <med>bipolar disorder</med>, rather than other mood or anxiety disorders. The episodic nature, the distinct shifts between depressive and elevated states, and the impulsivity and risk behaviors align with bipolar spectrum diagnoses. The report of suicidal thoughts during depression and risky behaviors during hypomanic phases further reinforce this impression. While anxiety symptoms and substance use are present, they appear secondary or comorbid, not primary.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment for bipolar disorder subtype and ruling out other mood or personality disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and monitor for suicidality, especially during depressive episodes.  \n3. Initiate a mood-stabilizing treatment, such as lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Incorporate psychoeducation about mood regulation, sleep hygiene, and substance use reduction strategies.  \n5. Consider psychotherapy options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to help manage mood fluctuations, impulsivity, and anxiety.  \n6. Regular follow-up to monitor treatment response, side effects, and evolving symptoms.",

Reported symptoms include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness during depressive episodes, alongside periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors. The patient also describes irritability, anxiety, and worry, particularly related to mood fluctuations, with occasional panic episodes. Dissociative experiences during intense mood states and transient feelings of identity confusion further support mood instability.\n\nSleep disturbances are prominent, with hypersomnia during depression and reduced sleep during hypomanic or manic episodes, aligning with cyclical mood states. Cognitive issues such as memory fog and concentration difficulties are noted, primarily during depressive periods. Intrusive thoughts and occasional self-harm ideation are reported, warranting attention to safety.\n\nSubstance use includes episodes of alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks in a day and occasional cigarette smoking, which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or hallucinations is reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Fluctuating mood states with depressive and hypomanic/manic features.\n- Impaired sleep regulation corresponding to mood episodes.\n- Cognitive and dissociative symptoms during mood extremes.\n- Risk factors include impulsivity, substance use, and passive suicidal ideation.\n- Anxiety symptoms are present but secondary to mood instability.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Reports of hopelessness and dark thoughts, raising concerns about suicidality.\n- Impulsive behaviors and risky decision-making during elevated moods.\n- Dissociation and identity confusion during mood swings.\n- Past substance use as a potential coping strategy.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient's symptomatology suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder characterized by episodic mood disturbances, significant sleep dysregulation, impulsivity, and cognitive disturbances. The presence of mood-related dissociative experiences and suicidal ideation indicates a need for careful monitoring and comprehensive treatment planning. Further assessment is recommended to clarify diagnosis, evaluate safety, and address comorbid anxiety and substance use.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your emotional and behavioral experiences over the past two weeks. It sounds like you are going through significant mood swings, with periods of deep depression characterized by <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, as well as episodes of elevated energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors during high phases. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociation</sym> and moments of <sym>identity confusion</sym> during intense mood states, along with sleep disturbances\u2014sleeping too much when depressed and very little when manic. Additionally, you've expressed concerns about <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>, and fluctuations in your anxiety levels, which sometimes lead you to avoid certain situations. Substance use, such as alcohol and cigarettes, also appears to be part of your coping pattern. Your openness about these experiences is important and shows your willingness to seek understanding and help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (likely bipolar II disorder or other mood disorder with mixed features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates significant mood variability characterized by depressive episodes with persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, alongside hypomanic or manic features such as <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and heightened energy. The presence of dissociative symptoms during mood swings and episodic mood states supports a diagnosis of <med>bipolar disorder</med>, rather than other mood or anxiety disorders. The episodic nature, the distinct shifts between depressive and elevated states, and the impulsivity and risk behaviors align with bipolar spectrum diagnoses. The report of suicidal thoughts during depression and risky behaviors during hypomanic phases further reinforce this impression. While anxiety symptoms and substance use are present, they appear secondary or comorbid, not primary.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment for bipolar disorder subtype and ruling out other mood or personality disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and monitor for suicidality, especially during depressive episodes.  \n3. Initiate a mood-stabilizing treatment, such as lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Incorporate psychoeducation about mood regulation, sleep hygiene, and substance use reduction strategies.  \n5. Consider psychotherapy options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to help manage mood fluctuations, impulsivity, and anxiety.  \n6. Regular follow-up to monitor treatment response, side effects, and evolving symptoms.",
