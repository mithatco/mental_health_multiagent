We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to help us understand different areas of your mental well-being to guide any further support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, about your feelings and experiences. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms like <sym>worry</sym> and feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, as well as <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as headaches and muscle aches that seem to correlate with your mood states. Your reports of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>cognitive fog</sym>, and social withdrawal during low periods highlight the difficulty these mood shifts cause in your daily life. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed by these intense and varied experiences, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge the effort you\u2019re making to manage them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> lasting over a period, characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, as well as episodes of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and increased goal-directed activity.

The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> features and somatic complaints further complicates the clinical picture but does not indicate psychosis or substance misuse. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and the episodic nature of mood states support this diagnosis over other mood or psychotic disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and consider standardized assessments to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions such as <med>major depressive disorder</med> or <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, and consider adjunctive psychotherapy focusing on managing mood swings and anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for any risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, especially during depressive episodes, and provide safety planning as needed.  \n4. Address <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based approaches to improve overall functioning.  \n5. Educate the patient about their condition, including the importance of medication adherence and recognizing early warning signs of mood episodes.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and low mood over the past two weeks, alongside reports of increased irritability, mood swings, and impulsivity during elevated phases. The patient reports decreased sleep and increased energy during manic episodes, with engagement in goal-directed activity and risky behaviors such as impulsive spending and relationship pursuits.\n\nAnxious features are evident, with feelings of nervousness, worry, and being on edge, particularly in relation to mood instability. The patient acknowledges social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors during low periods, along with somatic complaints like headaches and muscle aches associated with mood states. Cognitive difficulties, including concentration problems and memory fog, are noted during depressive episodes. Intrusive negative thoughts are reported, especially during low mood, without evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions.\n\nSubstance use history indicates episodic alcohol consumption, predominantly during hypomanic episodes, with no current tobacco or unprescribed medication misuse. No indications of dissociative symptoms or psychosis are present.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder with bipolar features, evidenced by distinct depressive and hypomanic episodes, coupled with comorbid anxiety symptoms. Risk factors include impulsivity, risky behaviors, and passive suicidal ideation during depressive lows. The patient's symptom profile warrants further assessment for bipolar spectrum disorder, comorbid anxiety, and evaluation of risk factors related to self-harm.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates episodic mood instability with depressive, hypomanic, and anxious features, alongside somatic complaints and cognitive impairments, necessitating comprehensive diagnostic clarification and targeted intervention planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of mood fluctuations, including periods of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low mood</sym>, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>decreased sleep</sym>. You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms like <sym>worry</sym> and feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, as well as <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as headaches and muscle aches that seem to correlate with your mood states. Your reports of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>cognitive fog</sym>, and social withdrawal during low periods highlight the difficulty these mood shifts cause in your daily life. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed by these intense and varied experiences, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge the effort you\u2019re making to manage them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> lasting over a period, characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, as well as episodes of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and increased goal-directed activity. These episodes appear to be episodic and distinct, aligning with a <med>Bipolar spectrum disorder</med>, specifically <med>Bipolar II</med>, which involves <sym>depressive episodes</sym> and <sym>hypomanic episodes</sym> without full-blown <med>mania</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> features and somatic complaints further complicates the clinical picture but does not indicate psychosis or substance misuse. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and the episodic nature of mood states support this diagnosis over other mood or psychotic disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and consider standardized assessments to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions such as <med>major depressive disorder</med> or <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, and consider adjunctive psychotherapy focusing on managing mood swings and anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for any risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, especially during depressive episodes, and provide safety planning as needed.  \n4. Address <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based approaches to improve overall functioning.  \n5. Educate the patient about their condition, including the importance of medication adherence and recognizing early warning signs of mood episodes.",
