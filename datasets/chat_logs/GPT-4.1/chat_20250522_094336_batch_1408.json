This is a questionnaire designed to get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space where you can honestly express your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which has been ongoing for some time, especially after losing your job. You also mention feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>emptiness</sym>, along with difficulties sleeping, such as waking up very early and feeling tired during the day. You\u2019ve noted some <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling lost in familiar places, as well as <sym>physical complaints</sym> like headaches and back pain that don\u2019t seem to have a clear cause. Social withdrawal and feelings of being disconnected from yourself and others are also prominent, and you\u2019ve experienced some <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym>, although you do not have plans to harm yourself. You describe irritability, feeling overwhelmed, and moments of feeling detached from your surroundings. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant impact on your mood, cognition, and social functioning, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (single episode, moderate severity)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> over the past two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation, along with somatic complaints like headaches and back pain, further support this diagnosis, as these are common neurovegetative features of depression. The social withdrawal, feelings of numbness, and passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> are consistent with moderate severity of depression, although there are no indications of psychotic features or active suicidal intent. The irritability and irritability-related <sym>overreacting</sym> also fit within the mood disturbance spectrum. While anxiety symptoms are suggested by avoidance behaviors, they are secondary to the primary mood disturbance rather than a separate anxiety disorder. Overall, the symptoms coalesce into a clinical picture of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> without evidence of psychosis or other primary mental health conditions.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis is based on the patient's reports of persistent low mood, anhedonia, and cognitive and somatic symptoms that have lasted for at least two weeks and cause significant impairment. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal plans, or substance misuse indicates a primary mood disorder rather than a psychotic or substance-induced disorder. The social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities, along with neurovegetative symptoms, are characteristic features. While some cognitive deficits are noted, these are often associated with depression and may improve with treatment. A provisional diagnosis is appropriate given the symptom profile, but ongoing assessment will be necessary to monitor for any changes or emergence of additional features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation, including assessment for any underlying medical conditions and screening for suicidality.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an SSRI or SNRI, in conjunction with psychoeducation about depression.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address negative thought patterns, social withdrawal, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions as needed.  \n5. Encourage engagement in activities gradually and provide support for social reintegration when appropriate.  \n6. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or, if necessary, sleep-focused interventions.",

Additionally, the patient reports significant cognitive difficulties, including memory impairment and disorientation (Q15), which may indicate cognitive slowing or neurovegetative symptoms associated with depression. \n\nThere are also notable mood and behavioral disturbances, such as irritability (Q4), social withdrawal and anhedonia (Q8, Q20), and passive death thoughts without active suicidal intent (Q11). Somatic complaints, including unexplained headaches and back pain (Q9), may be psychosomatic in nature or related to depressive symptomatology. The patient experiences episodes of feeling overwhelmed and detached (Q18), with some dissociative feelings, and reports feeling lost in terms of identity and relationships (Q19), indicating potential issues with self-concept and social connectedness.\n\nPatterns observed include consistent endorsement of low motivation, social withdrawal, cognitive impairment, and somatic concerns, all within a context of pervasive low mood. The absence of psychotic features (Q12, Q13), substance misuse, or active suicidal plans is noted, though passive death ideation warrants ongoing assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with possible neurocognitive features, and possibly comorbid anxiety symptoms indicated by avoidance behaviors (Q8) and feelings of overwhelm. The patient's irritable mood and social withdrawal may also suggest underlying mood dysregulation.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive death thoughts, social isolation, and ongoing low mood, which require vigilant monitoring for potential escalation. No current active suicidal intent is reported, but the passive death ideation and functional impairments are clinically relevant.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of depressive symptoms with cognitive and somatic components, significant social withdrawal, and passive death ideation, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and intervention targeting mood, cognition, and social functioning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which has been ongoing for some time, especially after losing your job. You also mention feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>emptiness</sym>, along with difficulties sleeping, such as waking up very early and feeling tired during the day. You\u2019ve noted some <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling lost in familiar places, as well as <sym>physical complaints</sym> like headaches and back pain that don\u2019t seem to have a clear cause. Social withdrawal and feelings of being disconnected from yourself and others are also prominent, and you\u2019ve experienced some <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym>, although you do not have plans to harm yourself. You describe irritability, feeling overwhelmed, and moments of feeling detached from your surroundings. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant impact on your mood, cognition, and social functioning, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (single episode, moderate severity)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> over the past two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation, along with somatic complaints like headaches and back pain, further support this diagnosis, as these are common neurovegetative features of depression. The social withdrawal, feelings of numbness, and passive <sym>death thoughts</sym> are consistent with moderate severity of depression, although there are no indications of psychotic features or active suicidal intent. The irritability and irritability-related <sym>overreacting</sym> also fit within the mood disturbance spectrum. While anxiety symptoms are suggested by avoidance behaviors, they are secondary to the primary mood disturbance rather than a separate anxiety disorder. Overall, the symptoms coalesce into a clinical picture of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> without evidence of psychosis or other primary mental health conditions.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis is based on the patient's reports of persistent low mood, anhedonia, and cognitive and somatic symptoms that have lasted for at least two weeks and cause significant impairment. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal plans, or substance misuse indicates a primary mood disorder rather than a psychotic or substance-induced disorder. The social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities, along with neurovegetative symptoms, are characteristic features. While some cognitive deficits are noted, these are often associated with depression and may improve with treatment. A provisional diagnosis is appropriate given the symptom profile, but ongoing assessment will be necessary to monitor for any changes or emergence of additional features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health evaluation, including assessment for any underlying medical conditions and screening for suicidality.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an SSRI or SNRI, in conjunction with psychoeducation about depression.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address negative thought patterns, social withdrawal, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions as needed.  \n5. Encourage engagement in activities gradually and provide support for social reintegration when appropriate.  \n6. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or, if necessary, sleep-focused interventions.",
