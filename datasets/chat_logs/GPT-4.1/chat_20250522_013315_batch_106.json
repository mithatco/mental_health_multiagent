You mention feeling <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>numb</sym>, and <sym>losing interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which indicates a persistent low mood. You've also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking early and feeling tired despite sleeping more. Additionally, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym> and occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with avoidance of social situations due to feeling <sym>on edge</sym>. You\u2019ve noted <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected from yourself, as well as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to guilt. Your experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> and social withdrawal suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms. You also mentioned some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which is important to monitor carefully. Overall, it\u2019s clear you are going through significant emotional distress and functional impairment, and you deserve compassionate support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Dissociative Symptoms (Derealization/Depersonalization)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>feeling detached from self or surroundings</sym> suggest dissociative features, which can occur in severe depression or anxiety states. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful safety assessment. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance use indicates these are primary mood and anxiety symptoms with dissociative features, rather than psychotic or substance-induced conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, ensuring safety plans are in place.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).\n3. Monitor for persistent or worsening dissociative symptoms, and consider specialized therapy if dissociation significantly impairs functioning.\n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or pharmacological options if appropriate.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, and involve support systems to enhance social connectedness.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up to assess treatment response and safety.",

These symptoms suggest comorbid mood and anxiety disorders with possible dissociative features, necessitating a comprehensive assessment to determine severity, functional impairment, and safety concerns. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and further exploration of dissociative experiences are recommended to inform diagnostic formulation and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and symptoms. You mention feeling <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>numb</sym>, and <sym>losing interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which indicates a persistent low mood. You've also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as waking early and feeling tired despite sleeping more. Additionally, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym> and occasional <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with avoidance of social situations due to feeling <sym>on edge</sym>. You\u2019ve noted <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected from yourself, as well as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to guilt. Your experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> and social withdrawal suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms. You also mentioned some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which is important to monitor carefully. Overall, it\u2019s clear you are going through significant emotional distress and functional impairment, and you deserve compassionate support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Dissociative Symptoms (Derealization/Depersonalization)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>feeling detached from self or surroundings</sym> suggest dissociative features, which can occur in severe depression or anxiety states. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful safety assessment. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance use indicates these are primary mood and anxiety symptoms with dissociative features, rather than psychotic or substance-induced conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, ensuring safety plans are in place.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).\n3. Monitor for persistent or worsening dissociative symptoms, and consider specialized therapy if dissociation significantly impairs functioning.\n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education or pharmacological options if appropriate.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, and involve support systems to enhance social connectedness.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up to assess treatment response and safety.",
