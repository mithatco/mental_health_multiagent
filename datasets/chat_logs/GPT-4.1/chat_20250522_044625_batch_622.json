Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps identify areas that might need further attention and ensures we're addressing your concerns effectively. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You are dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your irritability and heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, including panic episodes and hypervigilance, indicate significant distress. You also report troubling <sym>psychotic-like</sym> experiences such as hearing voices and feeling that others can read your thoughts, which can be very unsettling. Additionally, you\u2019re experiencing <sym>dissociative</sym> states, memory difficulties, and intrusive <sym>trauma-related</sym> flashbacks, especially around the anniversary of the accident. Your increased substance use and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> highlight the severity of your current struggles. It\u2019s understandable that you feel overwhelmed, isolated, and unsure about your future, but please know that these symptoms are important signals that support and help are available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with core features of <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors such as avoiding driving, hypervigilance, and heightened arousal. The presence of <sym>nightmares</sym>, <sym>dissociative</sym> experiences, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> support this diagnosis. The concurrent <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms\u2014persistent <sym>low motivation</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>\u2014indicate a significant mood component. The reported <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>-like experiences suggest possible dissociative or psychotic features, which can sometimes occur with severe trauma-related disorders. The patient's increased <sym>substance use</sym> appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism to manage distress and symptoms. All these factors combined point to a complex presentation best characterized by trauma-related disorder with mood and substance use components, though further assessment is needed to clarify whether psychotic features are primary or trauma-related.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive trauma-focused assessment to explore the presence and severity of <med>PTSD</med> and dissociative symptoms, possibly involving trauma-specific psychotherapy such as cognitive processing therapy or EMDR.  \n2. Provide safety planning and monitor for <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, including developing a crisis plan and possibly involving family or support systems.  \n3. Address <sym>substance use</sym> with integrated treatment options, such as referral to a substance use specialist or detoxification if necessary.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy to manage <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>trauma-related</sym> symptoms, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about trauma, dissociation, and substance use to empower the patient and improve insight.  \n6. Encourage engagement in support groups or peer support for trauma survivors to reduce isolation.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex symptom profile characterized by prominent post-traumatic stress symptoms, depressive features, and substance use behaviors. Key symptoms include persistent anhedonia and low motivation, feelings of depression and hopelessness, irritability, and increased reactivity. The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, with difficulties falling and staying asleep, along with fatigue. Anxiety is evident through pervasive tension, hypervigilance, avoidance of driving, and panic-like episodes with somatic symptoms such as heart racing and shortness of breath. Psychotic-like experiences are reported, including auditory hallucinations and ideation of mind-reading, suggesting possible dissociative or psychotic symptoms. Intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and emotional numbing indicate trauma-related distress. The patient also describes dissociative states and identity confusion, contributing to social withdrawal and feelings of detachment from others. Substance use has increased, with regular alcohol consumption, smoking, and unsupervised use of medications, raising concerns about self-medication and potential dependence. Expressed ideation of self-harm, although not currently acting on these thoughts, constitutes a significant risk factor requiring vigilant assessment.\n\nPatterns observed include trauma-related symptoms, heightened arousal, mood disturbances, dissociative experiences, and maladaptive coping strategies such as substance use. These symptoms collectively suggest a likely diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with comorbid depression and substance use disorder. The presence of auditory hallucinations and dissociative symptoms warrants further evaluation for possible psychotic features or dissociative disorders.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include the patient's risk for self-harm, substance dependence, and the impact of trauma on mental health functioning. The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal further compound functional impairment. Overall, the symptomatology indicates the need for comprehensive trauma-informed assessment, safety planning, and integrated treatment addressing PTSD, mood symptoms, dissociation, and substance use.",

While there are also depressive and psychotic-like symptoms, the primary focus on trauma-related symptoms indicates that PTSD is a fitting main diagnosis.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very detailed account of your experiences over the past two weeks, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a challenging time. You are dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your irritability and heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, including panic episodes and hypervigilance, indicate significant distress. You also report troubling <sym>psychotic-like</sym> experiences such as hearing voices and feeling that others can read your thoughts, which can be very unsettling. Additionally, you\u2019re experiencing <sym>dissociative</sym> states, memory difficulties, and intrusive <sym>trauma-related</sym> flashbacks, especially around the anniversary of the accident. Your increased substance use and thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> highlight the severity of your current struggles. It\u2019s understandable that you feel overwhelmed, isolated, and unsure about your future, but please know that these symptoms are important signals that support and help are available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with core features of <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors such as avoiding driving, hypervigilance, and heightened arousal. The presence of <sym>nightmares</sym>, <sym>dissociative</sym> experiences, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> support this diagnosis. The concurrent <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms\u2014persistent <sym>low motivation</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>\u2014indicate a significant mood component. The reported <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>-like experiences suggest possible dissociative or psychotic features, which can sometimes occur with severe trauma-related disorders. The patient's increased <sym>substance use</sym> appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism to manage distress and symptoms. All these factors combined point to a complex presentation best characterized by trauma-related disorder with mood and substance use components, though further assessment is needed to clarify whether psychotic features are primary or trauma-related.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive trauma-focused assessment to explore the presence and severity of <med>PTSD</med> and dissociative symptoms, possibly involving trauma-specific psychotherapy such as cognitive processing therapy or EMDR.  \n2. Provide safety planning and monitor for <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, including developing a crisis plan and possibly involving family or support systems.  \n3. Address <sym>substance use</sym> with integrated treatment options, such as referral to a substance use specialist or detoxification if necessary.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy to manage <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>trauma-related</sym> symptoms, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about trauma, dissociation, and substance use to empower the patient and improve insight.  \n6. Encourage engagement in support groups or peer support for trauma survivors to reduce isolation.",
