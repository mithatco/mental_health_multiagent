You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic or feeling overwhelmed</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as waking frequently at night and difficulty returning to sleep, are affecting your rest and energy levels. You described <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with feelings of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, which make you feel disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've had <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, though you haven't acted on them. You also report <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>feeling distant from loved ones</sym>. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, which are significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> (felt as <quote>pretty hopeless</quote>), <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and social withdrawal (not feeling close to others) align with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The prominent and pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive, distressing thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> such as repeated hand washing and checking, indicate <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The report of <sym>feelings of derealization</sym> and cognitive difficulties further support a complex presentation involving mood and anxiety disorders. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant careful monitoring. Based on the symptom profile, a diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features is most fitting, although ongoing assessment is needed to refine this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk and detailed history of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate or optimize evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, such as <med>SSRIs</med>, to address depressive and obsessive symptoms, under close medical supervision.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or consultation with a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts.",

Anxiety-related symptoms are also evident, including pervasive worry (A7), panic episodes (A8), avoidance behaviors (A9), and obsessive-compulsive features such as compulsive washing and checking (A17, A18). Sleep disturbance is reported, notably difficulty maintaining sleep (A15), accompanied by fatigue, which may exacerbate mood and cognitive concerns.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are indicated by episodes of derealization or depersonalization (A19), and difficulties with memory and orientation (A16). The patient reports intrusive, distressing thoughts about contamination and harm (A17), with some passive suicidal ideation (A12), although no active intent or plan is disclosed. There are also somatic complaints, including unexplained headaches and stomach aches correlated with stress (A10).\n\nPatterns suggest heightened anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology co-occurring with depressive features, contributing to social withdrawal and emotional dysregulation. The patient denies substance use and hallucinations, reducing immediate risk related to psychosis or substance misuse.\n\n**Potential clinical concerns include:**\n- Major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms\n- Risk of self-harm or suicidality, warranting close monitoring\n- Significant functional impairment, especially in social and occupational domains\n- Sleep disturbance and somatic complaints as exacerbating factors\n\n**Risk factors/warning signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts without active planning\n- Obsessive and compulsive behaviors impacting daily function\n- Feelings of disconnection and social withdrawal\n\n**Overall, the patient exhibits a complex presentation with marked depressive, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, requiring comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention to address mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety considerations.**",

      "expected": "ocd",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past two weeks. You feel <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, often feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, which impacts your motivation and enjoyment in life. You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic or feeling overwhelmed</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as waking frequently at night and difficulty returning to sleep, are affecting your rest and energy levels. You described <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with feelings of <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, which make you feel disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, you've had <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, though you haven't acted on them. You also report <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>feeling distant from loved ones</sym>. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, which are significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> (felt as <quote>pretty hopeless</quote>), <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and social withdrawal (not feeling close to others) align with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The prominent and pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive, distressing thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> such as repeated hand washing and checking, indicate <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The report of <sym>feelings of derealization</sym> and cognitive difficulties further support a complex presentation involving mood and anxiety disorders. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant careful monitoring. Based on the symptom profile, a diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features is most fitting, although ongoing assessment is needed to refine this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk and detailed history of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate or optimize evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, such as <med>SSRIs</med>, to address depressive and obsessive symptoms, under close medical supervision.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or consultation with a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and safety planning regarding suicidal thoughts.",
