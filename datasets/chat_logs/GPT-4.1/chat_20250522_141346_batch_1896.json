You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>low interest in activities</sym>, which seem to be affecting your mood and motivation. You\u2019ve also described symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicate significant emotional distress and risk. Additionally, your increased use of <sym>substances</sym> and <sym>medications</sym> suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Your sleep disturbances, physical aches, and memory issues further highlight the complexity of your current state. It\u2019s important that you know these feelings are taken seriously, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with <med>Anxiety Symptoms</med> and <med>Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, <sym>physical aches</sym>, and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> support this diagnosis. The intermittent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med> co-occurring with the mood disorder. The <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> suggest a risk that warrants safety considerations. Although some symptoms, such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, may suggest obsessive features, the overall clinical picture aligns more closely with a severe depressive episode with anxiety components. Substance use and medication misuse are concerning and may exacerbate the clinical picture, requiring intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>antianxiety medication</med>, in conjunction with psychiatric evaluation.  \n3. Provide <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use and medication misuse through integrated treatment or referral to specialized services.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and discuss strategies for managing symptoms.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, with potential referral to a psychiatrist or mental health specialist if needed.",

There are also prominent affective symptoms such as anxiety (frequent worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors), feelings of emotional numbness or dissociation (detachment from self and environment), and reports of intrusive thoughts. The patient endorses passive suicidal ideation, with occasional thoughts of self-harm, representing a notable risk factor that warrants immediate clinical attention.\n\nPatterns indicate comorbid mood and anxiety features, with additional behavioral indicators of distress, including increased substance use (alcohol, smoking, misuse of medications), and maladaptive coping strategies. The presence of somatic complaints (aches, pains) alongside sleep and cognitive issues further supports a complex presentation of mood disorder with possible somatic and anxiety components.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Major depressive symptoms with passive suicidal ideation\n- Anxiety symptoms including panic and avoidance\n- Cognitive impairment and dissociative experiences\n- Substance use and possible misuse of medications\n- Sleep disruption and somatic complaints\n\nRisk factors and warning signs:\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, especially with feelings of hopelessness\n- Substance use escalation\n- Reports of dissociation and cognitive disorientation\n- Feelings of emotional numbness and social withdrawal\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a severe mood disorder with suicidal ideation, significant anxiety, and functional impairment, necessitating immediate safety assessment, comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot right now. You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>low interest in activities</sym>, which seem to be affecting your mood and motivation. You\u2019ve also described symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> such as <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicate significant emotional distress and risk. Additionally, your increased use of <sym>substances</sym> and <sym>medications</sym> suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Your sleep disturbances, physical aches, and memory issues further highlight the complexity of your current state. It\u2019s important that you know these feelings are taken seriously, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with <med>Anxiety Symptoms</med> and <med>Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, <sym>physical aches</sym>, and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> support this diagnosis. The intermittent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med> co-occurring with the mood disorder. The <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> suggest a risk that warrants safety considerations. Although some symptoms, such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, may suggest obsessive features, the overall clinical picture aligns more closely with a severe depressive episode with anxiety components. Substance use and medication misuse are concerning and may exacerbate the clinical picture, requiring intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>antidepressant</med> and/or <med>antianxiety medication</med>, in conjunction with psychiatric evaluation.  \n3. Provide <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address substance use and medication misuse through integrated treatment or referral to specialized services.  \n5. Offer psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and discuss strategies for managing symptoms.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, with potential referral to a psychiatrist or mental health specialist if needed.",
