Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and discuss crisis resources.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, and possibly trauma-informed therapy if trauma history emerges.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about substance use and develop strategies for healthier coping mechanisms.  \n6. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.  \n7. Encourage social support and engagement in activities that promote connection and stability.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia and low mood characterized by anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, alongside increased irritability and irritability-related interpersonal conflicts. Sleep disturbance is prominent, with reduced sleep duration despite heightened energy levels, accompanied by restlessness and psychomotor agitation. There is evidence of impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors, including increased projects, spending, and substance use (notably alcohol and cigarettes) as maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of pervasive worry, hyperarousal, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal. Cognitive concerns include memory lapses and disorientation, coupled with intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors, suggestive of obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from oneself and reality, are also noted, alongside identity confusion and feelings of emotional numbness.\n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan, which constitutes a significant risk factor requiring immediate attention. Additionally, substance use\u2014alcohol and nicotine\u2014appears to serve as maladaptive coping strategies, potentially exacerbating mental health difficulties.\n\nClinically, the presentation warrants concern for a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive features, compounded by substance use and dissociative symptoms. The risk of harm due to passive suicidal thoughts, impulsivity, and substance use underscores the need for urgent assessment and intervention.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex constellation of symptoms that profoundly impact your daily life. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>persistent low mood and anhedonia</sym>, which have left you feeling <quote>\"pretty unmotivated\" and \"stuck.\"</quote> You also report <sym>increased irritability, irritability, and feeling on edge</sym>, along with significant <sym>sleep disturbances, including trouble falling asleep and waking frequently</sym>. Your energy levels seem high despite reduced sleep, and you\u2019ve engaged in <sym>impulsive behaviors such as risky spending and increased projects</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a major component, with <sym>worry, panic episodes, and avoidance of social situations</sym>. You also describe <sym>dissociative feelings of detachment, identity confusion, and emotional numbness</sym>. Additionally, there are serious concerns about <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use, including alcohol and cigarettes</sym>, which you sometimes rely on to cope. Your cognitive functioning shows some memory issues and feelings of being disconnected from reality, all of which suggest significant distress that needs careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with features of depression and hypomania, combined with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive traits, and substance use disorder.</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and irritability</sym>, consistent with <med>Mood disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder)</med>. The presence of <sym>reduced sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> suggests episodes of <med>hypomanic features</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors point to <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking, and dissociative experiences indicate <med>obsessive-compulsive and dissociative symptoms</med>. The patient's report of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> warrants urgent concern. The concurrent <sym>substance use</sym> appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, complicating the clinical picture. Overall, this constellation aligns with a complex mood and anxiety presentation with comorbid substance use, requiring comprehensive evaluation and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric assessment, including risk assessment for suicidality and detailed exploration of substance use patterns.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and discuss crisis resources.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, and possibly trauma-informed therapy if trauma history emerges.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about substance use and develop strategies for healthier coping mechanisms.  \n6. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen.  \n7. Encourage social support and engagement in activities that promote connection and stability.",
