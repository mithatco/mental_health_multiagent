I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool used to get a broad understanding of how you've been feeling and functioning recently. This assessment helps us identify areas that might need more attention and ensures your privacy and confidentiality are respected. The process involves asking you 23 questions about different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please feel free to be as open and honest as you can, and remember, this is a safe space. Let's begin with the first question."

Concurrently, there are notable anxiety symptoms characterized by persistent worry, feeling on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, indicating significant anxious distress. The patient reports sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, which may contribute to overall functional impairment. Cognitive concerns include recent memory difficulties and a sensation of mental fog, aligning with subjective experiences of cognitive slowing. Additionally, the patient reports episodes of dissociation, such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, which may warrant further assessment.\n\nNotable risk factors include passive suicidal ideation without current plans, along with feelings of social withdrawal and emotional numbness, heightening clinical concern for possible worsening of mood symptoms or emergent suicidality. The patient's physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches) may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Substance use appears minimal, with no current tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use reported.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a symptom profile consistent with major depressive disorder comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder, with features of panic attacks and dissociative experiences. The absence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) is noted.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep disruption, cognitive difficulties, and dissociative experiences, with passive suicidal thoughts as a potential safety concern. Further comprehensive assessment is recommended to determine diagnosis, severity, and safety planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing significant <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down most of the time</quote>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <quote>numbness</quote> in activities you once enjoyed. You've also described persistent <sym>worry and anxiety</sym>, feeling <quote>on edge</quote> and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> when overwhelmed. Your sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently, leading to feeling <quote>tired and drained</quote>. You've noticed <sym>memory problems</sym> and a sense of <quote>mental fog</quote>, along with episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> where you feel <quote>detached from yourself and your surroundings</quote>. Additionally, you've reported <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches without clear medical causes, and some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> that are concerning. You also feel <quote>dismissed or not taken seriously</quote> by others, which adds to your sense of isolation. Overall, it sounds like you're going through a very difficult time with a combination of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>tearfulness</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive complaints (memory issues, mental fog), and episodes of dissociation further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant careful attention but do not indicate active plans, which is important for safety considerations. The physical complaints are likely somatic manifestations of psychological distress. This profile aligns with a diagnosis of depression with significant anxiety features, both of which are impacting functioning and well-being.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms, including safety planning for suicidal thoughts.  \n2. Initiate or adjust psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and impact of symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medical evaluation, and monitor for physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and develop a safety plan regarding suicidal thoughts.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor treatment response, symptom progression, and safety concerns.",
