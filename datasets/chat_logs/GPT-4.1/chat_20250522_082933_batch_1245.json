This is a brief questionnaire designed to help us understand your current mental health symptoms across various areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express how you've been feeling. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time, about different aspects of your emotional and physical well-being over the past two weeks. If you're ready, I'll start with the first question."

Additionally, there are notable symptoms of anxiety, such as pervasive worry (Q7), restlessness (Q7), and episodic panic-like sensations (Q8), alongside avoidance behaviors (Q9). Cognitive concerns are evidenced by reported memory difficulties and disorientation (Q16), and there are perceptual disturbances characterized by depersonalization or derealization episodes (Q19). The patient also reports feelings of emotional disconnection and social withdrawal (Q20, Q21), which may reflect affective flattening or social anhedonia.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment suggested by sleep, concentration, and social issues. Self-harm ideation is present, with the patient acknowledging dark thoughts but denying current intent or plans (Q12). There are no indications of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions (Q13, Q14). Substance use appears minimal and not currently problematic.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with features of anxious distress, cognitive impairment, and dissociative symptoms. The report of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful assessment of safety risk. The patient's social withdrawal and emotional detachment suggest potential comorbidities affecting interpersonal functioning.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts, pervasive hopelessness, and dissociative experiences, which necessitate ongoing safety evaluation.

        "dsm_coverage": "The conversation covers most of the DSM-5 Level 1 domains, including mood, anger, anxiety, sleep, cognition, dissociation, and substance use. The therapist systematically asked about each domain, and follow-up questions aligned with DSM-5 criteria. However, some domains such as psychosis, mania, and personality functioning were not explicitly explored, and the conversation lacked probing in areas like mania or psychosis, which are critical for differential diagnosis. Overall, coverage is comprehensive but not perfectly thorough, preventing a top score.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Questions are well-aligned with DSM-5 criteria, using appropriate clinical language (e.g., 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless') and targeting core symptoms. The therapist did not distort or vague the questions, maintaining clinical accuracy. The follow-up inquiries are relevant and reflect typical clinical assessment practices. This domain demonstrates precise and effective question framing.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flows logically, with questions building on prior responses and following a coherent sequence. The therapist maintains a natural and professional tone, and responses are appropriately sequenced. Nonetheless, there is a slight tendency towards a checklist style rather than a truly conversational flow, and some areas (e.g., substance use, psychosis) are addressed briefly without depth. These minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and cognitive impairment is generally supported by the patient's symptoms, such as persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, cognitive difficulties, and anxiety. However, the justification is somewhat superficial; the reasoning mentions symptoms but does not thoroughly consider differential diagnoses like bipolar disorder (mania/hypomania) or detailed ruling out of psychosis, despite asking about psychotic symptoms. The explanation could be more explicit about how specific symptoms meet DSM-5 criteria, and about the severity and duration needed for the diagnosis. This limits the clarity of the diagnostic justification.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a generally professional and respectful tone, acknowledging the patient's distress and creating a supportive environment. The language is warm and non-judgmental, and the therapist provides validation. However, the responses are somewhat formulaic, and there's limited explicit empathetic phrasing or emotional attunement beyond basic acknowledgment. While professional, the interaction could be more personalized and empathetic to reach a perfect score."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a strong foundation in DSM-5 symptom coverage with clinically relevant questioning and a logical flow. The primary strengths are in the relevance and appropriateness of questions, as well as the structured approach to assessment. However, there are notable gaps in exploring certain critical domains such as psychosis and mania, and the diagnostic justification, while generally aligned, lacks depth and detailed reasoning. The dialogue is professional and supportive but could benefit from increased warmth and emotional attunement. Overall, this is a solid assessment conversation, though it falls short of excellence due to incomplete coverage of some diagnostic considerations and superficial justification of the diagnosis.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly identifies a mood disorder, specifically Major Depressive Disorder with associated anxiety and cognitive features, rather than an adjustment disorder. The detailed symptom profile (persistent depression, anhedonia, anxiety, cognitive impairment, dissociative symptoms, suicidal ideation) aligns more with a primary mood disorder than with an adjustment disorder, which typically involves a more transient and context-specific emotional response to stress. Therefore, the diagnosis does not match the expected profile of adjustment.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience, marked by persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym>. You also describe significant <sym>sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties</sym>, which have impacted your daily functioning. Your feelings of <sym>anxiety, worry, and episodes of panic</sym> are understandable responses to ongoing stress and emotional strain. It's clear that you are feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself and others</sym>, withdrawing from social interactions and feeling lost about your identity and direction in life. The presence of <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym> is concerning and important to address with care and support. Overall, you're experiencing a complex interplay of mood, cognitive, and dissociative symptoms that have caused considerable distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe, with Anxious Distress and Cognitive Impairment</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as constant worry, restlessness, and episodic panic attacks suggests an anxious component, often seen in depression with anxious distress. The report of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, including memory problems and disorientation, indicates possible cognitive impairment associated with severe depression. Additionally, the experiences of <sym>derealization/depersonalization</sym> and feelings of emotional disconnection point to dissociative symptoms, which can occur in severe mood states. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the importance of safety assessment. No psychotic symptoms are noted, and substance use appears minimal. The overall presentation reflects a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>.  \n2. Initiate or optimize <med>evidence-based pharmacotherapy</med> for depression, such as an antidepressant, considering the severity and presence of anxious features.  \n3. Refer for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Evaluate for possible <med>cognitive impairment</med> with neuropsychological testing and address any underlying medical or neurological contributors.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of safety, support systems, and treatment adherence.  \n6. Consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management and a mental health professional for ongoing therapy and monitoring.",
