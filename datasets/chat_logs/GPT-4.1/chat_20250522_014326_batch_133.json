Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to assess various mental health domains and identify any areas that might need further attention. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to be open about your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different aspects of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn. Are you ready to begin?"

There is evidence of irritability and anger (Q4), sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), and cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness and disorientation (Q16). The patient reports recurrent intrusive and dark thoughts (Q17), as well as feelings of dissociation or depersonalization (Q19), suggesting dissociative experiences. Additionally, there are indications of impulsivity and risky behavior, including increased initiation of projects and reckless spending (Q6), and substance use\u2014including alcohol, tobacco, prescription medications, and recreational drugs (Q22, Q23, Q24)\u2014which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient also reports social withdrawal and anhedonia extending to interpersonal relationships (Q20, Q21).\n\nPatterns reflect comorbid mood, anxiety, and possible psychotic or dissociative features. There are notable risk factors for self-harm, including recent thoughts of self-harm (Q12), substance misuse, and emotional dysregulation. Physical symptoms such as unexplained aches (Q10) may be psychosomatic or stress-related.\n\nOverall, the presentation warrants comprehensive psychiatric evaluation focusing on mood disorder, anxiety spectrum features, dissociative phenomena, substance use disorder, and suicidality risk. The complexity of symptoms indicates a need for integrated assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very detailed picture of what you've been experiencing lately. It sounds like you are going through a lot right now, with feelings of <sym>depression, hopelessness, and numbness</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety, panic attacks, and physical pains</sym>. You mentioned <quote>feeling lost, disconnected from yourself and others, and having dark thoughts about hurting yourself</quote>. Additionally, you've described <sym>sleep difficulties, forgetfulness, intrusive thoughts, and dissociative feelings</sym>. Your increased use of substances and risky behaviors seem to be ways you're coping with these overwhelming feelings. I want to acknowledge how challenging this must be for you and that seeking help is a positive step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, unspecified (likely Major Depressive Episode with anxious and dissociative features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>low interest, feelings of sadness and hopelessness, irritability, and thoughts of self-harm</sym> suggest a significant mood disturbance consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks, generalized anxiety symptoms, and avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Dissociative symptoms such as feeling <sym>detached from oneself and surroundings</sym> point to additional <med>Dissociative features</med>. The physical complaints and substance use may be coping mechanisms or related to stress. Given the constellation of symptoms and their impact on functioning, a diagnosis of an <med>unspecified mood disorder with anxious and dissociative features</med> best captures the clinical picture, especially since a more specific mood disorder diagnosis would require further assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess suicidality and safety.\n2. Initiate or adjust treatment with a mental health professional, considering psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy) and possibly pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety.\n3. Address substance use through specialized treatment or referral to addiction services.\n4. Develop a safety plan, including crisis resources, to manage thoughts of self-harm.\n5. Encourage social support and gradual re-engagement in activities to combat withdrawal and improve mood.\n6. Monitor and treat physical symptoms, possibly involving medical evaluation to rule out or manage stress-related somatic complaints.",
