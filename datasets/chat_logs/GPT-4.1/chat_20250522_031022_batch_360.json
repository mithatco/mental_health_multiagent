There is a notable presence of anxiety, characterized by persistent worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors related to agoraphobic tendencies. Sleep disturbances, including insomnia and non-restorative sleep, are reported, alongside cognitive concerns such as memory difficulties and feelings of dissociation or derealization. Intrusive and ruminative thoughts are evident, with some compulsive-like checking behaviors. The patient also reports somatic complaints, notably unexplained headaches and muscle pains, and expresses frustration with perceived invalidation by healthcare providers. \n\nThe responses reflect a significant degree of affective dysregulation, with episodic irritability and anger, and passive thoughts of self-harm, indicating risk for suicidality. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse is noted, although current symptoms suggest substantial functional impairment. The pattern of social withdrawal, anhedonia, and hopelessness, combined with anxiety and dissociative experiences, warrants comprehensive assessment and close monitoring for safety.

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of distressing experiences that significantly impact your daily life. You describe persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with episodes of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a major concern, evidenced by ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of situations that trigger your fears. Sleep difficulties, including <sym>trouble sleeping</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>, are also affecting you, as are cognitive concerns like <sym>memory issues</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>. You mention intrusive thoughts and some symptoms that resemble compulsive behaviors. Additionally, you experience <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as headaches and muscle pains that are not explained by medical causes, and you feel frustrated with how your symptoms are sometimes dismissed by healthcare providers. Importantly, you have had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder) and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal over at least two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>. Cognitive symptoms like <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> point toward dissociative features often associated with severe stress or anxiety. The somatic complaints and frustration about feeling dismissed could also suggest a component of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, though these are likely secondary to the primary mood and anxiety conditions. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates increased risk and warrants urgent safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess severity, and evaluate risk of self-harm or suicidality.  \n2. Initiate a combined treatment plan including <med>Psychotherapy</med> (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or trauma-informed therapy) and consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, tailored to the patient's needs.  \n3. Provide safety planning and crisis resources to address <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and ensure immediate safety.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and possibly medication, while monitoring for medical causes if symptoms persist.  \n5. Explore support for managing somatic complaints and validate the patient\u2019s experiences to reduce feelings of invalidation.",
