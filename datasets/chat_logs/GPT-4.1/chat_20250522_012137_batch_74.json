It sounds like you've been dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, panic episodes, and experiences that seem to include perceptual disturbances like hearing voices and feeling paranoid. You've also mentioned issues with <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. Additionally, your substance use and thoughts of self-harm are serious concerns that need careful attention. I can imagine how overwhelming this must be for you, and it's important to remember that help is available and that you're not alone in this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features (likely Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>paranoia</sym> (feeling that others can read thoughts), and <sym>delusional thinking</sym> suggest psychotic features accompanying the mood disorder. The <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and elevated <sym>anxiety</sym> indicate significant comorbid anxiety symptoms. Cognitive issues like <sym>memory impairment</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and <sym>disorganized thoughts</sym> point toward a severe mood disorder with psychotic features, possibly exacerbated by substance misuse and stress. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for urgent intervention. While other diagnoses like schizophrenia spectrum disorder could be considered, the predominant mood symptoms and episodic nature favor a mood disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidality</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, ensuring safety and developing a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to manage mood and psychotic symptoms.  \n3. Consider inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment to provide a structured environment for stabilization, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>trauma-informed therapy</med>, to address underlying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  \n5. Address substance use through targeted interventions or referral to specialized addiction services.  \n6. Regularly monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety, adjusting the treatment plan as needed.  \n7. Involve family or support systems when appropriate to enhance treatment adherence and provide support.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient exhibits multiple significant symptoms across affective, anxiety, psychotic-like, cognitive, and behavioral domains, indicating a complex and potentially severe presentation. Key concerns include persistent depressive symptoms characterized by anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal; pervasive anxiety with episodes of panic, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors; and perceptual disturbances, notably auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation. The report of disorganized thoughts, memory impairment, and derealization further suggests possible psychotic features. Sleep disturbances, including reduced sleep duration, fragmented sleep, and feelings of being energized despite poor rest, are prominent. The patient also reports recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, indicating possible obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.\n\nSubstance use appears problematic, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding typical social limits, regular cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed medication use, which may complicate clinical management and elevate risk.\n\nThe patient\u2019s self-reported suicidal ideation, although without intent or plan details, warrants immediate assessment for suicide risk. Additional risk factors include reported auditory hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and substance use, all of which increase clinical concern for potential deterioration.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms with psychotic features suggests a mood disorder with psychotic features or a primary psychotic disorder with mood symptoms.\n- The presence of dissociative experiences indicates possible dissociative symptoms or trauma-related pathology.\n- Elevated substance use, especially alcohol and nicotine, may exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and pose additional health risks.\n- The patient's insight into their distress and acknowledgment of symptoms provide an opportunity for engagement in treatment.\n\n**Risks and Warning Signs:**\n- Recurrent suicidal thoughts, even without current intent, and reports of auditory hallucinations.\n- Psychotic symptoms (voices, paranoid thoughts) and disorganized cognition.\n- Substance misuse, which could impair judgment and increase risk of harm.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia, indicating possible mood disorder severity.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with a complex psychiatric profile featuring major depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety including panic attacks, psychotic phenomena, cognitive disturbances, dissociative experiences, and substance misuse. The constellation of symptoms suggests a need for comprehensive diagnostic clarification, immediate risk assessment for suicidality, and development of an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, psychosis, anxiety, substance use, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging experience, and I want to acknowledge your honesty and courage in describing what you've been going through. It sounds like you've been dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, panic episodes, and experiences that seem to include perceptual disturbances like hearing voices and feeling paranoid. You've also mentioned issues with <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. Additionally, your substance use and thoughts of self-harm are serious concerns that need careful attention. I can imagine how overwhelming this must be for you, and it's important to remember that help is available and that you're not alone in this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features (likely Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>paranoia</sym> (feeling that others can read thoughts), and <sym>delusional thinking</sym> suggest psychotic features accompanying the mood disorder. The <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and elevated <sym>anxiety</sym> indicate significant comorbid anxiety symptoms. Cognitive issues like <sym>memory impairment</sym>, <sym>derealization</sym>, and <sym>disorganized thoughts</sym> point toward a severe mood disorder with psychotic features, possibly exacerbated by substance misuse and stress. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for urgent intervention. While other diagnoses like schizophrenia spectrum disorder could be considered, the predominant mood symptoms and episodic nature favor a mood disorder with psychotic features as the primary diagnosis at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidality</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, ensuring safety and developing a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to manage mood and psychotic symptoms.  \n3. Consider inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment to provide a structured environment for stabilization, especially given the severity of symptoms and substance use.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>trauma-informed therapy</med>, to address underlying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  \n5. Address substance use through targeted interventions or referral to specialized addiction services.  \n6. Regularly monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety, adjusting the treatment plan as needed.  \n7. Involve family or support systems when appropriate to enhance treatment adherence and provide support.",
