You also mention ongoing <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with avoidance of social situations and physical symptoms like headaches and back pain that seem related to stress. It\u2019s understandable that these fluctuations and feelings have been challenging and may lead you to feel overwhelmed or uncertain about how to manage them. Your honesty and insight are important steps toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (most consistent with Bipolar I or II, depending on the severity and duration of episodes)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> alternated with periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engagement in <sym>risky activities</sym> strongly suggest a diagnosis within the <med>bipolar spectrum</med>. The episodes of <sym>high energy</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>mania or hypomania</med>, while the lows involve classic depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms, such as persistent worry and avoidance, are common comorbidities in bipolar disorder and can complicate symptom management. The episodic nature, with clear mood fluctuations and associated changes in sleep and behavior, aligns with <med>bipolar I or II disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic features and active suicidal intent at present are noted but require ongoing monitoring given the history of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> during depressive episodes.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to formalize diagnosis, including mood disorder assessment and ruling out other conditions.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) and psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med>.  \n3. Incorporate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help manage symptoms, identify triggers, and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and risk behaviors regularly, especially during depressive episodes.  \n5. Address comorbid anxiety symptoms through appropriate interventions, possibly including medication or therapy.  \n6. Encourage healthy lifestyle habits, including regular sleep, stress management, and avoiding substances like alcohol and cigarettes that could worsen mood instability.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Summary and Observations**\n\n**Main Symptoms and Concerns:**  \nThe patient reports experiencing significant mood fluctuations consistent with bipolar disorder, characterized by episodes of depression (anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, and social withdrawal) and periods of elevated mood (reduced need for sleep, increased energy, impulsive behaviors, and risky activities). Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, including persistent worry, agitation, avoidance behaviors, and episodic feelings of fear or panic. Cognitive complaints include concentration difficulties and memory issues, particularly during depressive states. The patient acknowledges occasional intrusive racing thoughts but denies compulsive behaviors, dissociative episodes, or psychotic phenomena.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**  \n- Mood variability with cycles of depression and mania/hypomania is evident, evidenced by reports of both hypersomnia/hypersomnia and decreased need for sleep with high energy.  \n- Risk-taking behaviors and impulsivity during high phases suggest manic or hypomanic episodes.  \n- Anxiety symptoms, including worry and avoidance, are exacerbated during mood episodes.  \n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection are associated with depressive episodes.  \n- Substance use (alcohol and cigarettes) appears as a maladaptive coping strategy, especially during stressful periods.  \n- Cognitive and physical symptoms fluctuate with mood states, with some overlap between stress-related somatic complaints and mood symptoms.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- Bipolar spectrum disorder, given the episodic mood changes, sleep disturbances, impulsivity, and risky behaviors.  \n- Comorbid anxiety disorder, based on pervasive worry, avoidance, and physical tension.  \n- Subclinical suicidality risk, given thoughts of self-harm during depressive episodes, though no active plans or intent are reported.  \n- Substance use management, as alcohol and tobacco consumption may impact mental health and treatment engagement.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \n- Reports of fleeting self-harm thoughts during low mood, indicating a need for ongoing suicide risk assessment.  \n- Impulsive and risky behaviors, including impulsive spending and substance use, which could lead to adverse consequences.  \n- Mood instability with potential for escalation into more severe episodes, warranting close monitoring.  \n- The absence of psychotic symptoms or active suicidality at present reduces immediate risk but underscores the importance of continued assessment.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient presents with a history consistent with bipolar disorder, characterized by distinct episodes of depression and elevated mood, accompanied by associated cognitive, sleep, and behavioral disturbances. Anxiety symptoms are prominent and may compound mood dysregulation. There are ongoing concerns related to impulsivity, substance use, and transient self-harm thoughts that necessitate careful monitoring. Overall, these findings support a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid anxiety features, highlighting the need for integrated management strategies and ongoing risk assessment.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly references bipolar spectrum disorder, including symptoms characteristic of both depressive episodes (hopelessness, depression, fatigue) and elevated mood states (high energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, risky behaviors). The reasoning aligns with typical bipolar disorder features, and the diagnosis considers the episodic mood fluctuations and associated behaviors consistent with bipolar I or II. Although some anxiety features are noted, they are described as comorbid, not primary. Therefore, the diagnosis directly matches the expected bipolar profile.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your experiences, which include significant mood swings, episodes of feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, as well as periods of high energy where you sleep very little and engage in impulsive, risky behaviors. You also mention ongoing <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with avoidance of social situations and physical symptoms like headaches and back pain that seem related to stress. It\u2019s understandable that these fluctuations and feelings have been challenging and may lead you to feel overwhelmed or uncertain about how to manage them. Your honesty and insight are important steps toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (most consistent with Bipolar I or II, depending on the severity and duration of episodes)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym> alternated with periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engagement in <sym>risky activities</sym> strongly suggest a diagnosis within the <med>bipolar spectrum</med>. The episodes of <sym>high energy</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>mania or hypomania</med>, while the lows involve classic depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms, such as persistent worry and avoidance, are common comorbidities in bipolar disorder and can complicate symptom management. The episodic nature, with clear mood fluctuations and associated changes in sleep and behavior, aligns with <med>bipolar I or II disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic features and active suicidal intent at present are noted but require ongoing monitoring given the history of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> during depressive episodes.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to formalize diagnosis, including mood disorder assessment and ruling out other conditions.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) and psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med>.  \n3. Incorporate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help manage symptoms, identify triggers, and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Monitor for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and risk behaviors regularly, especially during depressive episodes.  \n5. Address comorbid anxiety symptoms through appropriate interventions, possibly including medication or therapy.  \n6. Encourage healthy lifestyle habits, including regular sleep, stress management, and avoiding substances like alcohol and cigarettes that could worsen mood instability.",
