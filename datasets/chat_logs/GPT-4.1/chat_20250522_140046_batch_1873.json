You describe persistent <sym>low interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, feeling <sym>hopeless and stuck in a dark place</sym>, and experiencing <sym>irritability and frustration</sym> even over minor issues. Sleep has been disrupted with early awakenings and feeling exhausted during the day, and you've noticed some <sym>memory problems and feelings of disconnection from yourself or reality</sym>. Anxiety is also a prominent part of your experience, with feelings of <sym>constant worry, tension, and occasional panic sensations</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> without active intent, and some physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches. Social withdrawal and a sense of being lost or not recognizing yourself are also notable. These symptoms collectively suggest a complex presentation involving mood disturbances, anxiety, dissociative feelings, and cognitive concerns, which have led to significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent <med>Anxious features</med> and <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance, along with cognitive issues such as memory problems. The presence of pervasive anxiety, worry, and panic-like sensations supports a comorbid <med>Anxious features</med>. The reports of <sym>feeling detached from self and surroundings</sym> and altered perception indicate dissociative phenomena, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety disorders. The active but passive <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> are concerning and suggest the need for careful suicidality assessment, but without active planning or intent. The overall symptom picture suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum with dissociative features, requiring a nuanced clinical approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment, including safety planning and possibly involving family or support systems.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.\n3. Initiate psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies, trauma-informed care, and mood regulation techniques.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.\n5. Explore possible neurocognitive evaluation to assess memory and disorientation symptoms.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, emphasizing that recovery is possible with appropriate treatment.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, response to treatment, and any emerging safety concerns.",

They report persistent low interest in activities, low energy, difficulty sleeping characterized by early morning awakenings, and cognitive concerns such as memory impairment and disorientation, which may warrant further neurocognitive evaluation. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of pervasive worry, tension, and episodic panic-like sensations, alongside avoidance behaviors related to social situations, indicating possible social anxiety or agoraphobic tendencies.\n\nThe patient experiences dissociative symptoms, including feelings of detachment from self and surroundings, as well as perceptual disturbances described as feeling disconnected from reality, which could suggest dissociative phenomena or other underlying psychopathology. They also report occasional passive death wishes without active suicidal intent; however, thoughts of death merit ongoing monitoring given their presence.\n\nSomatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle aches, which may be somatic manifestations of mood or anxiety symptoms. No evidence of psychotic features is present, as the patient denies hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, or thought broadcasting. Substance use appears minimal and non-problematic.\n\nPatterns of response reveal ongoing emotional distress, functional impairment, and dissociative experiences, with notable social withdrawal and anhedonia. Risk factors include passive death ideation and dissociative symptoms, which require careful assessment for suicidality and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation encompasses major depressive symptoms, prominent anxiety and dissociative features, sleep disturbance, cognitive complaints, and social withdrawal, all of which suggest a complex affective and anxiety disorder spectrum warranting comprehensive diagnostic clarification and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a wide range of difficult symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You describe persistent <sym>low interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, feeling <sym>hopeless and stuck in a dark place</sym>, and experiencing <sym>irritability and frustration</sym> even over minor issues. Sleep has been disrupted with early awakenings and feeling exhausted during the day, and you've noticed some <sym>memory problems and feelings of disconnection from yourself or reality</sym>. Anxiety is also a prominent part of your experience, with feelings of <sym>constant worry, tension, and occasional panic sensations</sym>. Additionally, you've mentioned <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> without active intent, and some physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches. Social withdrawal and a sense of being lost or not recognizing yourself are also notable. These symptoms collectively suggest a complex presentation involving mood disturbances, anxiety, dissociative feelings, and cognitive concerns, which have led to significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent <med>Anxious features</med> and <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance, along with cognitive issues such as memory problems. The presence of pervasive anxiety, worry, and panic-like sensations supports a comorbid <med>Anxious features</med>. The reports of <sym>feeling detached from self and surroundings</sym> and altered perception indicate dissociative phenomena, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety disorders. The active but passive <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> are concerning and suggest the need for careful suicidality assessment, but without active planning or intent. The overall symptom picture suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum with dissociative features, requiring a nuanced clinical approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment, including safety planning and possibly involving family or support systems.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.\n3. Initiate psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies, trauma-informed care, and mood regulation techniques.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.\n5. Explore possible neurocognitive evaluation to assess memory and disorientation symptoms.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, emphasizing that recovery is possible with appropriate treatment.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, response to treatment, and any emerging safety concerns.",
