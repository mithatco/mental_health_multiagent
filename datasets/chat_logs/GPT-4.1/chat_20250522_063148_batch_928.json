Anxiety features are also evident, characterized by pervasive worry, hyperarousal, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, suggesting comorbid anxiety disorder. Sleep disturbances are significant, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, contributing to fatigue and overall impairment. The patient reports episodic muscle tension and somatic complaints\u2014headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort\u2014consistent with somatic manifestations of psychological distress. There are no reported psychotic symptoms, self-harm ideation, or substance misuse, and the patient explicitly denies suicidal thoughts.

      "predicted": "You have shared with me that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past couple of weeks. You've described persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym>, having difficulty <sym>sleeping</sym> despite feeling tired, and experiencing episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that sometimes lead to avoidance of certain situations. Additionally, you've noted physical symptoms like <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>gastrointestinal discomfort</sym>. Despite these difficulties, you explicitly denied thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>hallucinations</sym>. Your withdrawal from social connections and feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> suggest significant emotional distress. I want to acknowledge how overwhelming this must be for you and appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest a concurrent <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, physical complaints such as <sym>muscle tension</sym> and <sym>gastrointestinal issues</sym>, and intrusive thoughts support this diagnosis. Importantly, the patient denies <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, and there is no evidence of <sym>substance misuse</sym>. The combination of emotional and physical symptoms indicates a complex mood and anxiety disorder that warrants targeted treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that includes psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focused on managing depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Consider a pharmacological approach with a psychiatrist to evaluate the potential benefit of antidepressant medication.  \n3. Regularly monitor for any changes in mood, suicidal thoughts, or worsening symptoms, and provide safety planning as needed.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical evaluation to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Encourage engagement in social activities gradually to reduce withdrawal and improve mood.",
