We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a set of questions designed to understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps us get a broad picture of your experiences and can guide us in planning the best support for you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The process involves answering 23 questions about various symptoms, and I will ask each one in turn. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just honest responses about how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>low mood</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>lost or uncertain about oneself</sym> suggest a comorbid <med>depressive episode</med>.

Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on social anxiety and depression to help address avoidance behaviors, thought patterns, and emotional regulation.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for potential pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can be effective for both social anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Encourage development of social skills and gradual exposure to social situations in a supportive setting to reduce avoidance and build confidence.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",

The responses reveal marked anticipatory anxiety, heightened irritability, and physical symptoms such as racing heart and sleep disturbances, particularly in contexts involving social engagement. Additionally, there are features suggestive of depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, feelings of numbness, and mood fluctuations, albeit without evidence of suicidal ideation or self-harm intent. The patient reports persistent worry, rumination, and difficulty forming close relationships, which may contribute to social withdrawal and feelings of being lost or uncertain about self-identity.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Consistent reports of social avoidance, anxiety, and physiological arousal point toward social anxiety disorder.\n- Symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, and fatigue suggest comorbid depressive features.\n- Elevated irritability and mood lability are noted.\n- Sleep difficulties, especially trouble initiating sleep linked to anticipatory anxiety, are evident.\n- No evidence of psychosis, substance misuse, or disorientation.\n- The patient denies suicidal or self-harm thoughts.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Significant social avoidance and social anxiety, which may impair functioning.\n- Reports of physical symptoms associated with anxiety.\n- No current indications of active suicidality or self-harm behaviors.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits clinical features consistent with social anxiety disorder, accompanied by depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and mood disturbances. The pattern of social avoidance, physiological anxiety, and mood symptoms warrants comprehensive assessment for social phobia and comorbid depression, with attention to functional impairment and potential development of additional comorbidities. Further evaluation should include exploration of the severity of symptoms, impact on daily functioning, and screening for other possible underlying or related conditions.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you often experience <sym>significant anxiety in social situations</sym>, leading you to avoid gatherings, parties, and other interactions where you might feel judged or scrutinized. You also mention feeling <sym>numb or indifferent</sym> toward activities you used to enjoy, along with occasional <sym>feelings of sadness or hopelessness</sym>. Despite these feelings, you do not have thoughts of harming yourself, and you recognize that your physical symptoms\u2014such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>\u2014are closely tied to your anxiety and stress levels. It sounds like these experiences are quite distressing and impact your ability to engage fully in life and relationships, leaving you feeling uncertain about yourself and your future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses demonstrate a persistent and marked <sym>fear of social situations</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and sleep disturbances, which are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>low mood</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>lost or uncertain about oneself</sym> suggest a comorbid <med>depressive episode</med>. The avoidance of social interactions and the tendency to ruminate and feel detached further support these diagnoses. There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or other medical conditions that would alter this clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on social anxiety and depression to help address avoidance behaviors, thought patterns, and emotional regulation.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for potential pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can be effective for both social anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Encourage development of social skills and gradual exposure to social situations in a supportive setting to reduce avoidance and build confidence.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
