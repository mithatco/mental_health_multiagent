This is a questionnaire that helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to gather information in a respectful and confidential environment, so you can feel safe sharing your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms. We will go through each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and a sense of being lost or disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty staying asleep and feeling exhausted during the day, despite having <sym>increased energy</sym> at times. You experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including pervasive worry, feelings of being on edge, and episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are frightening. Avoidance of social situations and physical symptoms like aches and pains are also part of your current difficulties. Additionally, you mentioned intrusive thoughts related to your anxiety and feelings of detachment from reality, which are very unsettling. Your experiences suggest a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily functioning, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, With Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> with dissociative features (possible depersonalization/derealization symptoms).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and feeling lost support this diagnosis. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, indicates comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med> and generalized anxiety features. The episodes of feeling disconnected from oneself or reality, along with physical symptoms like feelings of unreality, suggest dissociative phenomena, which can occur with severe anxiety and depression. The patient's passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without plans warrant careful risk assessment. Overall, the clinical picture points to a serious mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative symptoms, requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicidal behaviors, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan combining pharmacotherapy (such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications) with psychotherapy, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or therapist experienced in trauma-informed care and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Explore strategies for improving sleep hygiene and managing physical symptoms, possibly involving a medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical causes.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of depression, anxiety, and dissociation to help the patient understand their experiences and reduce feelings of confusion or self-blame.",

There are notable cognitive and affective disturbances evidenced by feelings of disconnection and identity confusion (Q20, Q19). Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and non-restorative sleep (Q15), along with reports of increased energy despite reduced sleep (Q5), suggestive of a potential mood disorder with features of hypomania or agitation.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are significant, with reports of pervasive worry, feeling on edge (Q7), panic attacks (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), consistent with panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Intrusive thoughts related to panic episodes (Q17) further support this assessment. Physical complaints such as aches and pains (Q10) and memory issues (Q16) may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress or comorbid conditions.\n\nRisk factors include expressed passive suicidal ideation without plans (Q12), and feelings of emotional numbing and detachment, which may elevate risk for self-harm if symptoms persist or worsen. The patient's social withdrawal, feelings of disconnection, and sense of lost identity are clinically significant, indicating potential severity of mood and dissociative symptoms.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative features, warranting comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning to address depressive, anxious, and somatic symptoms, alongside risk management for suicidal ideation.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing experience characterized by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, with little interest or pleasure in activities that once brought you joy. You also described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and a sense of being lost or disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty staying asleep and feeling exhausted during the day, despite having <sym>increased energy</sym> at times. You experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including pervasive worry, feelings of being on edge, and episodes of <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are frightening. Avoidance of social situations and physical symptoms like aches and pains are also part of your current difficulties. Additionally, you mentioned intrusive thoughts related to your anxiety and feelings of detachment from reality, which are very unsettling. Your experiences suggest a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily functioning, and I appreciate your openness in sharing these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, With Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> with dissociative features (possible depersonalization/derealization symptoms).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and feeling lost support this diagnosis. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, indicates comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med> and generalized anxiety features. The episodes of feeling disconnected from oneself or reality, along with physical symptoms like feelings of unreality, suggest dissociative phenomena, which can occur with severe anxiety and depression. The patient's passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without plans warrant careful risk assessment. Overall, the clinical picture points to a serious mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative symptoms, requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including risk of self-harm or suicidal behaviors, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan combining pharmacotherapy (such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications) with psychotherapy, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or therapist experienced in trauma-informed care and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Explore strategies for improving sleep hygiene and managing physical symptoms, possibly involving a medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical causes.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of depression, anxiety, and dissociation to help the patient understand their experiences and reduce feelings of confusion or self-blame.",
