We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a sense of your mental health over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to better understand your current experiences and symptoms so we can figure out the best way to support you. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express what you're going through. I will ask you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

You're also dealing with intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which include physical sensations like <sym>heart pounding</sym> and <sym>sweating</sym>. Your avoidance of certain situations, such as driving, along with sleep disturbances and nightmares, suggest trauma-related stress. Additionally, you've shared concerns about <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and increased substance use as a way to cope. All these symptoms paint a picture of significant distress and difficulty managing daily functioning, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and trauma-related symptoms, possibly indicative of <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> (PTSD).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, hyperarousal, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The recurrent intrusive memories, nightmares, dissociation, and avoidance of trauma-related cues point toward <med>PTSD</med>. The report of suicidal thoughts, substance use, and physical symptoms such as aches and pains also support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, trauma, and maladaptive coping strategies. While somatic complaints are present, they seem to be intertwined with psychological distress rather than solely medical concerns. This constellation warrants a comprehensive, integrated treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Obtain a detailed clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and trauma history, possibly involving a trauma-focused evaluation.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), tailored to address depression and anxiety symptoms, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address substance use concerns by providing psychoeducation and exploring options for reduction or cessation, possibly involving addiction specialists.  \n5. Develop a safety plan to manage suicidal thoughts and ensure immediate support if feelings of self-harm intensify.  \n6. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n7. Provide psychoeducation about trauma, anxiety, and depression to increase understanding and engagement in treatment.",

Comorbid anxiety features are evident, characterized by pervasive worry and hyperarousal (Q7), panic attacks with physical symptoms (Q8), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations such as driving (Q9). Sleep disturbances are prominent, with reports of insomnia, frequent nocturnal awakenings, nightmares related to trauma, and resultant functional impairment (Q15, Q16). The patient also reports somatic complaints, including tension-related aches and pains (Q10), and episodes of dissociation (Q19).\n\nPattern analysis reveals a convergence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology, alongside trauma-related intrusions (Q17) and compulsive-like behaviors such as checking (Q18). Substance use\u2014namely increased alcohol consumption (Q22), cigarette smoking (Q23), and unprescribed use of pain medications (Q24)\u2014are notable and may represent maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (Q12), physical symptoms of panic (Q8), substance misuse, and avoidance behaviors, which may contribute to social isolation and functional decline. The patient's expressed feelings of confusion about self-identity (Q20) and feeling disconnected from others further suggest underlying identity concerns and emotional numbing.\n\nOverall, the presentation indicates a complex clinical picture with significant mood, anxiety, trauma-related, and substance use components requiring comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex mix of emotional, psychological, and physical symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. You've described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and persistent <sym>depressive thoughts</sym>. You're also dealing with intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which include physical sensations like <sym>heart pounding</sym> and <sym>sweating</sym>. Your avoidance of certain situations, such as driving, along with sleep disturbances and nightmares, suggest trauma-related stress. Additionally, you've shared concerns about <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and increased substance use as a way to cope. All these symptoms paint a picture of significant distress and difficulty managing daily functioning, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and trauma-related symptoms, possibly indicative of <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</med> (PTSD).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, hyperarousal, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The recurrent intrusive memories, nightmares, dissociation, and avoidance of trauma-related cues point toward <med>PTSD</med>. The report of suicidal thoughts, substance use, and physical symptoms such as aches and pains also support a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, trauma, and maladaptive coping strategies. While somatic complaints are present, they seem to be intertwined with psychological distress rather than solely medical concerns. This constellation warrants a comprehensive, integrated treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Obtain a detailed clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and trauma history, possibly involving a trauma-focused evaluation.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), tailored to address depression and anxiety symptoms, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address substance use concerns by providing psychoeducation and exploring options for reduction or cessation, possibly involving addiction specialists.  \n5. Develop a safety plan to manage suicidal thoughts and ensure immediate support if feelings of self-harm intensify.  \n6. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n7. Provide psychoeducation about trauma, anxiety, and depression to increase understanding and engagement in treatment.",
