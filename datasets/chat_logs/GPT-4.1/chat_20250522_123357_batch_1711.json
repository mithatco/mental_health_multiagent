This tool helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering mood, anxiety, sleep, and other domains. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. There's no rush, and you can answer as openly as you're comfortable. Let's start with the first question: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Your sleep has been disrupted, with <quote>fewer hours and fragmented sleep</quote>, yet you still feel restless and full of energy, engaging in <quote>risky and impulsive behaviors</quote>. Anxiety is also prominent, especially in social situations, accompanied by <quote>panic episodes</quote> and avoidance of social settings. You mention physical discomforts like headaches and stomach aches, and you express concerns about not being understood regarding your health. Importantly, you\u2019ve shared <quote>dark thoughts about hurting yourself</quote>, which indicates a serious risk that needs immediate attention. Your cognitive experiences include forgetfulness and episodes of feeling disconnected or outside yourself, along with intrusive negative thoughts and confusion about your identity and purpose. Overall, your symptoms reflect a significant mood disturbance with features of depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and distress, requiring careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe</med> with <med>Anxiety Symptoms and Impulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The sleep disturbance, physical complaints, and intrusive negative thoughts support a mood disorder diagnosis. The reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014including <sym>social anxiety</sym>, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors\u2014along with physical symptoms, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The impulsive engagement in risky activities and increased energy levels are indicative of possible <med>hypomanic or manic symptoms</med>, although the episodic nature of such symptoms is not clearly established here. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for urgent intervention. The cognitive and dissociative symptoms, such as feeling detached and forgetfulness, further complicate the clinical picture. Taken together, these features point toward a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and impulsivity, warranting comprehensive evaluation and immediate safety measures.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk assessment for self-harm and suicide, to determine safety needs.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan and consider hospitalization if the risk of harm is imminent.  \n3. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis and consider medication management for depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, emotional regulation, and social anxiety.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely and establish regular follow-up to assess treatment response and adjust plan accordingly.",

There are notable symptoms of irritability and anger (Q3), alongside sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and fragmented sleep quality (Q4, Q14). The patient reports increased engagement in risky and impulsive behaviors (Q5), suggestive of elevated impulsivity or possible manic/hypomanic symptoms. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of social anxiety (Q6), panic episodes (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8), indicating social phobia and panic-related features. Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and stomach aches (Q9) are present but may be secondary to psychological distress. The patient expresses concerns about being misunderstood or dismissed by others regarding health issues (Q10).\n\nThe patient endorses active suicidal ideation, including dark thoughts and intent to self-harm (Q11), which constitute a significant risk factor requiring immediate attention. There are no reported perceptual disturbances such as auditory hallucinations (Q12) or thought broadcasting (Q13). Cognitive symptoms include forgetfulness, disorientation in familiar settings (Q15), and intrusive negative thoughts (Q16), which may point toward cognitive or affective dysregulation.\n\nAdditional features include depersonalization or derealization episodes (Q18) and identity confusion or anhedonia in social relationships (Q20). Substance use appears minimal, with no significant alcohol, tobacco, or non-prescribed drug use (Q21-Q23).\n\nPatterns suggest a complex presentation involving major depressive features with comorbid anxiety, impulsivity, and potential mood instability. The presence of suicidal ideation, impulsivity, and panic symptoms raises concern for elevated clinical risk requiring urgent assessment and intervention.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with a severe mood disorder with prominent depressive and anxious features, alongside impulsivity and risk of self-harm. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to determine diagnostic formulation and safety planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your current experiences, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it can be to manage these feelings and symptoms. You describe persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling numb or indifferent, and hopelessness</quote>, combined with <sym>irritability and anger</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <quote>fewer hours and fragmented sleep</quote>, yet you still feel restless and full of energy, engaging in <quote>risky and impulsive behaviors</quote>. Anxiety is also prominent, especially in social situations, accompanied by <quote>panic episodes</quote> and avoidance of social settings. You mention physical discomforts like headaches and stomach aches, and you express concerns about not being understood regarding your health. Importantly, you\u2019ve shared <quote>dark thoughts about hurting yourself</quote>, which indicates a serious risk that needs immediate attention. Your cognitive experiences include forgetfulness and episodes of feeling disconnected or outside yourself, along with intrusive negative thoughts and confusion about your identity and purpose. Overall, your symptoms reflect a significant mood disturbance with features of depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and distress, requiring careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe</med> with <med>Anxiety Symptoms and Impulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The sleep disturbance, physical complaints, and intrusive negative thoughts support a mood disorder diagnosis. The reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014including <sym>social anxiety</sym>, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors\u2014along with physical symptoms, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The impulsive engagement in risky activities and increased energy levels are indicative of possible <med>hypomanic or manic symptoms</med>, although the episodic nature of such symptoms is not clearly established here. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for urgent intervention. The cognitive and dissociative symptoms, such as feeling detached and forgetfulness, further complicate the clinical picture. Taken together, these features point toward a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and impulsivity, warranting comprehensive evaluation and immediate safety measures.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk assessment for self-harm and suicide, to determine safety needs.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan and consider hospitalization if the risk of harm is imminent.  \n3. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis and consider medication management for depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.  \n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, emotional regulation, and social anxiety.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely and establish regular follow-up to assess treatment response and adjust plan accordingly.",
