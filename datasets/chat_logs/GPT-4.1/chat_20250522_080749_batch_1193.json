Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to get a broad sense of your mental health over the past two weeks across various areas, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one carefully. There's no rush, and you can take your time to answer honestly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You've also described significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by <sym>racing heart, sweating, and sudden fear</sym>. Sleep has been challenging, with frequent awakenings and feeling restless during the day, compounded by difficulties with memory and episodes of feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. You mentioned having <sym>negative repetitive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>uncertainty about your identity and relationships</sym>, along with some passive thoughts of self-harm. Importantly, you do not experience <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as hearing voices or believing others can hear your thoughts, and you do not currently misuse substances. Your presentation suggests a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, which are significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with somatic symptoms and pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Additionally, avoidance behaviors and fears related to crowded places and public settings point toward <med>Agoraphobia</med>. The presence of dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached, further complicates the clinical picture but does not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or current self-harm behaviors indicates that these symptoms are primarily mood and anxiety related.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), tailored to the patient's needs and tolerability.  \n3. Refer to a psychologist or therapist experienced in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, including exposure strategies for agoraphobia.  \n4. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding passive suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n5. Explore additional supportive interventions such as psychoeducation, social support, and possible group therapy to address social withdrawal and emotional regulation.",

Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including generalized worry, frequent panic attacks with somatic manifestations (e.g., chest tightness, sweating), and avoidance behaviors related to agoraphobic concerns. Sleep disturbance is evident, with multiple nocturnal awakenings and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive complaints include memory difficulties and episodes of dissociation, such as feeling detached from oneself and surroundings. The patient reports recurrent negative ruminations and intrusive thoughts, alongside irritability and emotional instability.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment due to avoidance and social withdrawal. There are no indications of psychotic features, substance misuse, or current self-harm behaviors; however, passive suicidal ideation is noted, warranting ongoing monitoring.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass major depressive disorder with comorbid panic disorder and agoraphobia, possibly with dissociative features. The patient\u2019s presentation warrants a comprehensive assessment of mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, along with safety planning regarding passive suicidal thoughts.\n\nKey risk factors or warning signs include persistent hopelessness, passive suicidal ideation, and severe anxiety with panic attacks; these necessitate careful risk assessment and appropriate intervention.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of distressing symptoms. These include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, which have led to feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal. You've also described significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by <sym>racing heart, sweating, and sudden fear</sym>. Sleep has been challenging, with frequent awakenings and feeling restless during the day, compounded by difficulties with memory and episodes of feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings. You mentioned having <sym>negative repetitive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>uncertainty about your identity and relationships</sym>, along with some passive thoughts of self-harm. Importantly, you do not experience <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as hearing voices or believing others can hear your thoughts, and you do not currently misuse substances. Your presentation suggests a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, which are significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with somatic symptoms and pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Additionally, avoidance behaviors and fears related to crowded places and public settings point toward <med>Agoraphobia</med>. The presence of dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached, further complicates the clinical picture but does not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or current self-harm behaviors indicates that these symptoms are primarily mood and anxiety related.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), tailored to the patient's needs and tolerability.  \n3. Refer to a psychologist or therapist experienced in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety, including exposure strategies for agoraphobia.  \n4. Monitor for safety concerns, especially regarding passive suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n5. Explore additional supportive interventions such as psychoeducation, social support, and possible group therapy to address social withdrawal and emotional regulation.",
