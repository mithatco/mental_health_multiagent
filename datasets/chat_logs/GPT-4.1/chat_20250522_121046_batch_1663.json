The presence of pervasive anxiety, including <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> point toward dissociative features that may be secondary to or co-occurring with the mood and anxiety symptoms. The cognitive complaints, including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and disorientation, further support a clinical picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative components. The absence of current <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> is noted, but ongoing monitoring is recommended.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for comorbidities, including possible trauma history.  \n2. Consider starting or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, tailored to symptom profile.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies for depression and anxiety, and consider trauma-informed approaches if relevant.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if needed, medication management.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety, especially regarding dissociative experiences and mood symptoms.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia and feelings of depression, with reported anhedonia and hopelessness over the past two weeks. They also experience heightened irritability, social anxiety characterized by pervasive nervousness, anticipatory worry, and panic episodes especially in social contexts, alongside avoidance of social situations. Sleep disturbances are noted, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in non-restorative sleep and daytime exhaustion. Cognitive complaints include recent memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments, suggesting potential cognitive or attentional impairment. Additionally, the patient reports feelings of emotional detachment and derealization, which may indicate dissociative symptoms linked to anxiety or stress. Intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts are present, though compulsive behaviors are not prominent. The patient denies current suicidal ideation or intent but reports transient passive wishes for disappearance.\n\nPatterns observed indicate a predominant internalizing symptom profile characterized by anxiety, depressive mood, social withdrawal, and dissociative experiences. No current substance use or self-harm thoughts are reported, but the presence of panic symptoms and dissociation warrants close monitoring.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive features, generalized anxiety with panic symptoms, sleep disruption, cognitive complaints, and dissociative phenomena. These symptoms suggest a complex presentation that may involve comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, with notable functional impairment in social and cognitive domains. Risk factors appear limited to anxiety-driven avoidance and dissociative episodes; however, ongoing assessment for self-harm risk and suicidality remains essential.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of depressive, anxious, and dissociative symptoms with significant functional impact, necessitating comprehensive evaluation to determine appropriate diagnostic formulation and intervention planning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of experiences that reflect significant emotional distress and difficulty functioning across multiple areas of your life. It\u2019s understandable to feel <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> while also struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>. Your feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>social avoidance</sym> suggest that these symptoms are impacting your daily interactions and sense of self. It\u2019s clear that these challenges are causing you considerable discomfort, and it\u2019s brave of you to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> (such as derealization and depersonalization).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive anxiety, including <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> point toward dissociative features that may be secondary to or co-occurring with the mood and anxiety symptoms. The cognitive complaints, including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and disorientation, further support a clinical picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative components. The absence of current <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> is noted, but ongoing monitoring is recommended.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for comorbidities, including possible trauma history.  \n2. Consider starting or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, tailored to symptom profile.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies for depression and anxiety, and consider trauma-informed approaches if relevant.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if needed, medication management.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety, especially regarding dissociative experiences and mood symptoms.",
