Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and you can answer honestly about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

Key features include anhedonia (diminished interest in activities), persistent low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal. The patient reports significant anxiety symptoms characterized by pervasive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments. Sleep disturbance is evident, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining restful sleep, along with feelings of restlessness and fatigue. Cognitive complaints include forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, and occasional disorientation in familiar settings. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features. The patient also endorses somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle tension, and gastrointestinal discomfort, alongside a history of substance use\u2014specifically alcohol and cigarette smoking\u2014as maladaptive coping strategies. \n\nNotably, the patient reports passive suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\" about not being here\") without current intent or plan, which constitutes a significant safety concern. No psychotic symptoms are endorsed. The pattern of increased irritability, agitation, and substance use further complicates the clinical picture. While dissociative symptoms are absent, the overall presentation reflects a high level of psychological distress with multiple interrelated symptom domains.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive and generalized anxiety disorder.\n- Risk of self-harm or suicidality.\n- Substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism.\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive deficits.\n- Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal.\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation warrants immediate assessment of safety.\n- Substance use may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- Chronic sleep disturbance and physical complaints may impact overall functioning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive symptoms, pervasive anxiety, somatic complaints, and maladaptive coping behaviors, with notable risk factors for suicidality. An integrated treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, substance use, and safety planning is indicated.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a complex mix of emotional and physical symptoms that have been impacting your daily life. You feel <sym>persistent low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Your anxiety is quite severe, characterized by <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance of social situations due to fear of having a panic attack. Sleep has been a significant challenge for you, with difficulty falling asleep and feeling restless even when you do sleep, which leaves you feeling tired during the day. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>checking behaviors</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>muscle tension</sym>, and stomach discomfort. Additionally, you mention <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about not wanting to be here, which indicates a concern for your safety. Your use of alcohol and cigarettes appears to be a way to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Overall, you\u2019re navigating a very difficult period marked by emotional distress, physical discomfort, and increasing social withdrawal, and your honesty is a vital step toward getting help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Concerns</med> (Alcohol and Nicotine Dependence)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and sleep disturbances support the presence of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The endorsement of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about not wanting to be here indicates a risk for suicidality that warrants careful monitoring. The reported use of alcohol and cigarettes as coping strategies suggests the presence of <med>Substance Use Concerns</med>, which may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms and should be addressed as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. The absence of psychotic features and dissociative symptoms further clarifies the current clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including an immediate evaluation of suicide risk, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or medication management with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Address <med>substance use</med> through motivational interviewing and explore options for reduction or abstinence, possibly involving a substance use specialist.  \n4. Develop a sleep hygiene plan and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the interplay of mood, anxiety, and substance use, and offer ongoing support and monitoring of symptoms and safety.",
