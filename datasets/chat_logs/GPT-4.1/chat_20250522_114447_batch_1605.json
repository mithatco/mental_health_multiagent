Your feelings of <sym>withdrawal</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future, combined with recent <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use, indicate that you are facing significant emotional distress. I want to acknowledge how brave it is to share these feelings, and I am here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym>, consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>poor sleep</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, indicating comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The history of <sym>heavy alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>cigarette smoking</sym>, and <sym>non-prescribed medication use</sym> suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the emotional difficulties. The combination of mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences, and substance use points toward a complex clinical picture involving multiple overlapping conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and substance use, including safety assessment for suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicide risk, including crisis resources and support systems.\n3. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based approaches such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) focused on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n4. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and possible impulsivity.\n5. Address substance use through integrated treatment programs, including motivational interviewing and possible referral to addiction services.\n6. Encourage engagement with social supports and activities that promote connection and recovery.\n7. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",

Key features include persistent low mood characterized by anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, accompanied by irritability and increased irritability. The individual reports decreased sleep, heightened energy levels, and engagement in risky behaviors, indicative of possible hypomanic or manic episodes. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with pervasive worry about finances and future, episodic panic attacks, and avoidance of social situations, pointing toward generalized anxiety and social phobia features.\n\nCognitive and somatic complaints are evident, including concentration difficulties, forgetfulness, and unexplained somatic complaints such as headaches and stomach aches, which may reflect psychosomatic manifestations or comorbid somatic conditions. Intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking routines, and feelings of dissociation (e.g., depersonalization) suggest presence of obsessive-compulsive or dissociative symptomatology.\n\nThe individual endorses passive suicidal ideation without explicit plan or intent, constituting a significant warning sign for self-harm risk. The reported history of recent self-injurious thoughts, along with substance use behaviors\u2014including heavy alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed medication use\u2014further elevate clinical concern regarding impulsivity, self-medication, and potential substance use disorder.\n\nNotable patterns include mood instability, impulsivity, substance misuse, and dissociative experiences. The patient's social withdrawal and decreased emotional connectedness may exacerbate underlying mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive episode with anhedonia and hopelessness\n- Hypomanic or manic symptoms (elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, risky behaviors)\n- Generalized anxiety disorder with panic features\n- Obsessive-compulsive tendencies\n- Dissociative experiences\n- Suicidal ideation with potential for self-harm\n- Substance use disorder (alcohol, tobacco, non-prescribed medications)\n- Somatic symptom presentation\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts\n- Substance misuse\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors\n- Dissociative episodes\n- Sleep disturbance\n- Social withdrawal\n- Intrusive, obsessive thoughts\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood dysregulation, anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences, and substance use, with notable risk factors including suicidal ideation and impulsivity. The clinical picture warrants comprehensive assessment to evaluate mood disorder severity, suicidality, substance use impact, and potential comorbid conditions, along with safety planning and targeted interventions.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply personal account of experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that have been affecting your mood, thoughts, and daily functioning. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a difficult time, feeling <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>lost</sym>, and <sym>distracted</sym> by intrusive thoughts and concerns. Your feelings of <sym>withdrawal</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> about the future, combined with recent <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use, indicate that you are facing significant emotional distress. I want to acknowledge how brave it is to share these feelings, and I am here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym>, consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>poor sleep</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, indicating comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The history of <sym>heavy alcohol consumption</sym>, <sym>cigarette smoking</sym>, and <sym>non-prescribed medication use</sym> suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the emotional difficulties. The combination of mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences, and substance use points toward a complex clinical picture involving multiple overlapping conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and substance use, including safety assessment for suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicide risk, including crisis resources and support systems.\n3. Initiate or optimize treatment with evidence-based approaches such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) focused on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n4. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and possible impulsivity.\n5. Address substance use through integrated treatment programs, including motivational interviewing and possible referral to addiction services.\n6. Encourage engagement with social supports and activities that promote connection and recovery.\n7. Monitor symptoms regularly to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
