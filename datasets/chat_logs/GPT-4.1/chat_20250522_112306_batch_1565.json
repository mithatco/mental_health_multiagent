This questionnaire is designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks across different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I appreciate your honesty in answering.

Key symptoms include anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal during depressive episodes. During manic phases, the patient reports decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and heightened energy levels. Anxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors. The patient also describes intrusive negative thoughts, dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and environment), and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness.\n\nPatterns demonstrate mood variability consistent with mood episodes, with depressive symptoms predominating but punctuated by periods of elevated energy and activity. Sleep disturbances are noted across mood states, including hypersomnia during depression and reduced sleep during mania. The patient denies psychotic symptoms but reports some perceptual dissociation. There are no current active suicidal or self-harm ideation, though passive thoughts of not wanting to be here are noted.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include bipolar disorder given the episodic mood elevation and depression, along with associated impulsivity, decreased sleep, and energy fluctuations. Anxiety symptoms and avoidance behaviors may compound functional impairment. The presence of intrusive thoughts and dissociative experiences warrants further assessment for comorbid anxiety or dissociative symptoms.\n\nRisk factors include mood instability, impulsivity, and passive suicidal ideation. No active self-harm or substance use behaviors are reported at this time, although previous alcohol use during manic episodes is noted.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits episodic mood dysregulation with features suggestive of bipolar spectrum disorder, accompanied by significant anxiety and dissociative symptoms. Further diagnostic clarification and risk assessment are recommended to inform targeted treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your experiences, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it can be to navigate these fluctuating moods, thoughts, and feelings. It\u2019s understandable to feel <sym>hopeless</sym> or <sym>detached</sym> at times, especially when experiencing <sym>depressive episodes</sym>. Your reports of <sym>periods of heightened energy</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, and impulsive behaviors suggest episodes of <med>hypomania or mania</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, as well as intrusive <sym>negative thoughts</sym> and dissociative feelings, further complicate your emotional landscape. Though you deny active thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychosis</sym>, your experiences indicate a significant mood and anxiety symptom burden that requires careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode mixed\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's description of <sym>alternating episodes of depression</sym> and <sym>elevated energy or irritability</sym>, including <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym> during manic phases, impulsivity, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, aligns with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> such as feeling <sym>detached</sym> from oneself and <sym>uncertainty about self</sym> further suggests mood instability with possible comorbid anxiety or dissociative features. The mixed presentation, with both depressive and elevated symptoms occurring concurrently, is characteristic of a <med>mixed episode</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity and impact of symptoms.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, under psychiatric supervision to manage mood swings.\n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy, to address mood regulation, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and establish a regular sleep routine to help stabilize mood.\n5. Educate yourself about bipolar disorder to better understand your symptoms and improve self-management strategies.\n6. If suicidal thoughts or passive ideation persist, prioritize safety and seek immediate mental health support.",
