Today, I'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess different areas of mental health, including mood, anxiety, psychosis, and others. The purpose is to better understand your symptoms and how they might be affecting you. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you. The assessment involves going through 23 questions, one at a time, about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019re hearing <sym>voices</sym> and feeling that your <sym>thoughts are being broadcast or read</sym>, which can be very frightening and confusing.

You\u2019ve mentioned <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote>, and recent increases in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a very challenging time, and your experiences involve a mixture of mood, psychotic, dissociative, and substance-related symptoms that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorder with comorbid major <med>depressive disorder</med> and <med>substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, and <sym>delusions</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorders. The persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, suggest a concurrent <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> further complicate the clinical picture and may exacerbate psychotic and mood symptoms. Dissociative experiences, such as <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, along with cognitive impairments like <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, support a diagnosis involving a complex interplay of psychotic and dissociative features. The severity and combination of these symptoms indicate a need for a comprehensive, integrated treatment approach, and a provisional diagnosis of <med>schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorder with mood and substance use components is most consistent with the clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history and mental status examination, to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate antipsychotic medication management to address <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, with close monitoring for side effects.  \n3. Provide integrated treatment for <med>depressive symptoms</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), and consider antidepressant medication if appropriate.  \n4. Offer substance use counseling and support to reduce <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use, and address maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Implement safety planning and monitor for <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, providing crisis resources as needed.  \n6. Consider referral to specialized services for <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> and cognitive impairments, potentially including trauma-focused therapy if trauma history is identified.  \n7. Arrange for ongoing psychiatric follow-up to monitor progress, medication adherence, and emerging needs.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, indicative of depressive symptoms; heightened anxiety, including generalized worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors; and psychotic-like phenomena such as auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting delusions. Additionally, the patient reports dissociative experiences characterized by depersonalization and derealization, as well as cognitive impairments including memory difficulties and disorientation.\n\nPatterns observed reveal concurrent mood dysregulation, psychotic symptoms, and dissociative features, suggestive of a severe mental health presentation. Substance use appears maladaptive, with recent increases in alcohol consumption and tobacco use, alongside non-prescribed medication or drug intake for self-medication. The patient also endorses passive self-harm thoughts, which constitute a significant risk factor for suicidality.\n\nClinical significance includes high levels of emotional distress, risk for self-harm, and potential for psychosis or a primary psychotic disorder, compounded by substance misuse. The dissociative and perceptual symptoms warrant further evaluation for possible dissociative disorders or other psychotic spectrum conditions. The patient's subjective experience of invalidation and feeling misunderstood may impact therapeutic engagement.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe mood symptoms intertwined with psychotic and dissociative features, alongside substance use and passive suicidal ideation, necessitating comprehensive psychiatric assessment and integrated intervention planning.",

The inclusion of dissociative and cognitive symptoms further supports a complex presentation often seen in schizophrenia spectrum conditions.

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing and complex set of experiences. You\u2019re struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, feeling numb and detached from activities you once enjoyed. You also experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations. You\u2019re hearing <sym>voices</sym> and feeling that your <sym>thoughts are being broadcast or read</sym>, which can be very frightening and confusing. Dissociative feelings like <sym>feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym> are also present, along with notable <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>perceptual disturbances</sym>. You\u2019ve mentioned <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote>, and recent increases in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a very challenging time, and your experiences involve a mixture of mood, psychotic, dissociative, and substance-related symptoms that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorder with comorbid major <med>depressive disorder</med> and <med>substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, and <sym>delusions</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorders. The persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, suggest a concurrent <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> further complicate the clinical picture and may exacerbate psychotic and mood symptoms. Dissociative experiences, such as <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, along with cognitive impairments like <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, support a diagnosis involving a complex interplay of psychotic and dissociative features. The severity and combination of these symptoms indicate a need for a comprehensive, integrated treatment approach, and a provisional diagnosis of <med>schizophrenia</med> spectrum disorder with mood and substance use components is most consistent with the clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history and mental status examination, to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate antipsychotic medication management to address <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, with close monitoring for side effects.  \n3. Provide integrated treatment for <med>depressive symptoms</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), and consider antidepressant medication if appropriate.  \n4. Offer substance use counseling and support to reduce <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use, and address maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Implement safety planning and monitor for <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, providing crisis resources as needed.  \n6. Consider referral to specialized services for <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> and cognitive impairments, potentially including trauma-focused therapy if trauma history is identified.  \n7. Arrange for ongoing psychiatric follow-up to monitor progress, medication adherence, and emerging needs.",
