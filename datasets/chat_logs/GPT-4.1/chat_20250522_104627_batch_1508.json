This assessment is designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers different domains like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more, to give a comprehensive picture of your current state. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The process involves me asking you 23 questions, and I'd like you to answer them as honestly and openly as you can. We can take our time, and you're welcome to share as much detail as you feel comfortable with. Are you ready to begin with the first question about mood?"

You also described periods of elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors, which suggest <med>bipolar spectrum symptoms</med>.

The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate a need for careful monitoring and intervention but do not currently involve active plans. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes, behavioral dysregulation, and associated symptoms align with this clinical impression, though ongoing assessment is essential.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and consider medication options such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics for mood regulation.  \n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to develop coping strategies for mood swings, anxiety, and dissociation.  \n3. Establish a safety plan, including regular monitoring of suicidal thoughts, and consider involving a supportive network or crisis resources if needed.  \n4. Address sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to help stabilize mood and reduce anxiety symptoms.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a complex symptom profile indicative of mood dysregulation, characterized by significant depressive and manic/hypomanic features. Key depressive symptoms include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, fatigue despite variable sleep patterns, psychomotor agitation, cognitive disturbances such as forgetfulness and distractibility, and passive death thoughts without active suicidal plans. The patient reports physical symptoms such as unexplained headaches and back pains, often stress-related, as well as dissociative experiences of detachment, which may reflect underlying emotional distress.\n\nConversely, there are clear indicators of hypomanic episodes, evidenced by decreased need for sleep (3\u20134 hours with feelings of wiredness), increased goal-directed activity (initiating multiple projects impulsively), risky behaviors (spending and relational impulsivity), elevated irritability, racing thoughts, and episodes of intense fear or panic. The patient's self-reported engagement in risky activities and impulsivity further support this.\n\nPatterns reveal episodic mood swings with alternating depressive and hypomanic symptoms, suggestive of bipolar spectrum disorder. The presence of anxiety symptoms, social avoidance, and physical tension, along with dissociative feelings, complicate the clinical picture. The patient admits to passive suicidal thoughts but denies current intent or plans, which constitutes a significant risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\nClinically significant concerns include mood instability, impulsivity, potential suicidality, dissociative experiences, and social withdrawal. The patient's history of substance use appears minimal but warrants continued assessment given the temptation to self-medicate.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, impulsivity, irritability, and dissociative episodes, all of which necessitate careful evaluation and safety planning. Overall, the patient's presentation aligns with a bipolar disorder spectrum, with prominent mood episodes, behavioral dysregulation, and associated anxiety and dissociative features.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of experiences that reflect significant mood fluctuations, including episodes of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym>, and physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>back pains</sym>. You also described periods of elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors, which suggest <med>bipolar spectrum symptoms</med>. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and social withdrawal, all of which contribute to a complex clinical picture. Your honest sharing about thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and feeling misunderstood highlights the emotional distress you're going through. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re facing challenges with mood stability, impulsivity, and feelings of loneliness, and I want you to know that your experiences are valid and deserve attention and care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med> and possible <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes recurrent <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with pervasive <sym>hopelessness</sym>, anhedonia, and physical symptoms, alongside hypomanic episodes marked by <sym>decreased sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and increased goal-directed activity. The episodic nature of mood swings, with clear periods of elevated mood and impulsivity, supports a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including avoidance and heightened tension, alongside dissociative experiences, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate a need for careful monitoring and intervention but do not currently involve active plans. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes, behavioral dysregulation, and associated symptoms align with this clinical impression, though ongoing assessment is essential.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and consider medication options such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics for mood regulation.  \n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to develop coping strategies for mood swings, anxiety, and dissociation.  \n3. Establish a safety plan, including regular monitoring of suicidal thoughts, and consider involving a supportive network or crisis resources if needed.  \n4. Address sleep hygiene and stress management techniques to help stabilize mood and reduce anxiety symptoms.",
