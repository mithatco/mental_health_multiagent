Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different domains. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share what's been going on. We will go through a series of 23 questions, and I will ask about how you've been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. There are no right or wrong answers, just whatever best describes your experience. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The repetitive checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts may also reflect obsessive-compulsive features but are more consistent with anxiety-driven compulsions. The absence of psychotic symptoms, self-harm thoughts, or substance misuse points toward an anxiety and mood disorder spectrum rather than psychosis or somatic symptom disorder. The overall presentation indicates a complex interaction between anxiety and depression impacting functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for comorbidities.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatment options such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting anxiety and depression.  \n3. Discuss pharmacotherapy options, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for both <med>GAD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.  \n4. Address sleep hygiene and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to reduce physical tension and worry.  \n6.

Key concerns include persistent low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness, indicative of depressive symptomatology. Additionally, the patient exhibits significant anxious distress characterized by pervasive worry, restlessness, physical tension (headaches, muscle tension, stomach upset), and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, resulting in fatigue and restlessness.\n\nPatterns observed include:\n- Endorsement of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks.\n- Elevated anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry, somatic tension, irritability, and avoidance.\n- Sleep impairment with decreased sleep quality and frequent racing thoughts.\n- Repetitive, intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggestive of ruminative and possibly obsessive-compulsive tendencies.\n- Disconnection from social relationships, contributing to feelings of isolation.\n- No evidence of psychotic symptoms, self-harm ideation, or substance misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance:\n- Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate to severe.\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder, with features of restlessness, worry, and physical symptoms.\n- Possible comorbid obsessive-compulsive features given compulsive checking.\n- Impact on social functioning and overall quality of life.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs:\n- No current suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts reported.\n- No substance misuse or risky behaviors identified.\n- Elevated anxiety and sleep disturbances warrant monitoring for escalation or worsening of symptoms.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with prominent depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, marked by pervasive worry, physical tension, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal. These symptoms significantly impair daily functioning and warrant comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in daily activities, which seem to have been ongoing for at least the past two weeks. You also describe feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> by <sym>worry</sym> about various aspects of life, including your <sym>health</sym> and <sym>work</sym>. Physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>muscle tension</sym>, and <sym>stomach upset</sym> are common for you, especially when anxious or stressed. Sleep has been a challenge, with difficulty falling asleep and waking up feeling <sym>restless</sym> and <sym>tired</sym>. You mention feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>disconnected</sym> from others, which has affected your relationships. You also report engaging in <sym>repetitive checking behaviors</sym> and experiencing <sym>racing thoughts</sym>. Overall, these symptoms have been distressing and interfere with your daily life, but you do not report any thoughts of <med>self-harm</med> or <med>substance misuse</med>.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), moderate to severe</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent <sym>worry</sym> that is difficult to control, along with physical manifestations such as <sym>muscle tension</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomach upset</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, align with <med>GAD</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and sleep disturbance suggests concomitant <med>MDD</med>. The repetitive checking behaviors and intrusive thoughts may also reflect obsessive-compulsive features but are more consistent with anxiety-driven compulsions. The absence of psychotic symptoms, self-harm thoughts, or substance misuse points toward an anxiety and mood disorder spectrum rather than psychosis or somatic symptom disorder. The overall presentation indicates a complex interaction between anxiety and depression impacting functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for comorbidities.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatment options such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting anxiety and depression.  \n3. Discuss pharmacotherapy options, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective for both <med>GAD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.  \n4. Address sleep hygiene and consider behavioral interventions to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to reduce physical tension and worry.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.",
