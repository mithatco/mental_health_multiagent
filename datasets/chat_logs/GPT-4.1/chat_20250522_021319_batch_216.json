We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which helps identify various mental health symptoms across different areas. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share openly. We will go through 23 questions covering different domains such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. I'll ask you each question, and I'd like you to answer honestly and as naturally as possible. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Key features include persistent anhedonia and depressive affect, characterized by feelings of dullness, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. There are notable irritability and anger outbursts, alongside sleep disturbances marked by decreased sleep duration coupled with restlessness and unrefreshing sleep, suggesting potential mood or anxiety-related dysregulation.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident through reports of pervasive worry, heightened nervousness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors in social and crowded settings. Psychotic-like experiences are described as auditory hallucinations (hearing whispers or voices) and delusional beliefs about thought broadcasting and mind-reading, which warrant careful assessment for psychosis-spectrum disorders.\n\nCognitive concerns include recent memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments. There are also recurrent intrusive and distressing thoughts, along with compulsive behaviors (checking, counting), indicating possible obsessive-compulsive features. Experiences of dissociation\u2014feeling detached from self and surroundings\u2014and identity confusion suggest dissociative symptoms.\n\nThe patient reports feelings of emotional numbness and social disconnection, alongside anhedonia and diminished interest in relationships, consistent with depressive and possibly schizoid features. Substance use is significant, with alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits, regular cigarette smoking, and self-reported use of illicit substances and non-prescribed medications, which may influence symptom presentation and pose additional risk.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts of hurting myself\") without reported intent or plan, and substance misuse, which increase the vulnerability for adverse mental health outcomes. The presence of auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, dissociation, and mood symptoms underscores the need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to delineate diagnosis, assess risk, and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation reflects complex, overlapping psychopathology including mood disorder features, psychosis-like experiences, dissociative phenomena, and substance use, necessitating a multidisciplinary assessment and careful risk management.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a wide range of challenging experiences that suggest you are going through a difficult time. You\u2019ve been feeling <sym>persistent sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy</sym>, which can be really draining. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable and easily annoyed</sym>, along with <sym>trouble sleeping, restlessness, and feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Your experiences include <sym>hearing whispers or voices that others don't hear</sym>, <sym>beliefs that your thoughts are being broadcast or that others can read your mind</sym>, and <sym>intrusive, distressing thoughts</sym>. You\u2019ve been experiencing <sym>difficulty with memory and orientation</sym> and feeling <sym>detached from your body or identity</sym>. Additionally, your use of alcohol, cigarettes, and other substances indicates some reliance on these to cope. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life and emotional well-being, and it\u2019s brave of you to share this with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) with mood and dissociative features, possibly comorbid substance use disorder and anxiety disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing whispers or voices), <sym>delusional beliefs about thought broadcasting and mind-reading</sym>, and dissociative symptoms like <sym>feeling detached from oneself and surroundings</sym> suggest psychotic features that do not fully meet criteria for <med>schizophrenia</med> but indicate a possible <med>psychotic disorder NOS</med>. The prominent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness and anhedonia</sym>, alongside irritability and sleep disturbances, point toward a mood disorder component, possibly a <med>major depressive disorder</med> with psychotic features or a mood disorder with psychotic features. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive behaviors are consistent with <med>obsessive-compulsive features</med>. Additionally, the reported <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes, could be contributing to or exacerbating the psychotic and mood symptoms. The complexity and overlap of these symptoms suggest a mixed presentation requiring comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a thorough psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnosis and assess risk, especially regarding potential <med>psychosis</med> and <med>suicidal ideation</med>.  \n2. Consider initiating or adjusting pharmacological treatment, including antipsychotic medication and mood stabilizers or antidepressants, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <sym>intrusive thoughts, dissociative symptoms, and substance use</sym>.  \n4. Address substance use through counseling or specialized programs to reduce intake and improve overall mental health.  \n5. Ensure a strong support system and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning for safety and support.  \n6. Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and safety, especially regarding <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>.",
