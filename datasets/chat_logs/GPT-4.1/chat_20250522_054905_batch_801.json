Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool used to understand various aspects of your mental and emotional well-being over the past two weeks. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to share your experiences. We will go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just whatever best describes how you've been feeling. Are you ready to start with the first question?"

Your sleep difficulties, including <sym>trouble falling asleep, waking frequently, and reduced sleep duration</sym>, are contributing to your sense of exhaustion and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a major concern, with ongoing <sym>worry, tension, and avoidance of situations that provoke anxiety</sym>. You\u2019ve also disclosed <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and recent <sym>use of alcohol, smoking, and non-prescribed medications</sym> as ways to cope. Additionally, feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as <quote>feeling like I\u2019m watching myself from outside</quote>, and <sym>disturbing recurring thoughts or images</sym> further complicate your emotional landscape. These symptoms collectively suggest you are facing significant mental health difficulties that warrant comprehensive attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Self-Harm Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry, tension, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, support a concurrent <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or an anxiety component within mood disorder. The explicit report of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates increased risk, requiring urgent safety assessment. The dissociative experiences and cognitive issues suggest possible trauma-related or dissociative features, which can often coexist with mood and anxiety disorders. The substance use, including <sym>alcohol and tobacco</sym>, may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, complicating the clinical picture. Given the multifaceted nature of your symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Mood Disorder with Anxiety Features and Self-Harm Risk</med> best captures your current state.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate immediate risk related to <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider pharmacological treatment options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.  \n3. Engage in evidence-based psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and maladaptive coping strategies, including substance use.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical consultation for sleep management.  \n5. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms are persistent or linked to past trauma.  \n6. Consider support for substance use, including counseling for alcohol and tobacco use, to reduce reliance on substances as coping mechanisms.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",

Substance use is notable, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels and increased smoking, alongside non-prescribed medication use, which could serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal a pattern of emotional dysregulation, sleep disruption, cognitive difficulties, and behavioral avoidance, alongside somatic complaints such as aches and pains. The patient exhibits risk factors for suicidal ideation and self-harm, warranting immediate safety assessment.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits clinical features consistent with moderate to severe depression, generalized anxiety, dissociative symptoms, and substance use issues.

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex array of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges that significantly impact your daily life. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>detachment from activities you once enjoyed</sym>, along with persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. Your sleep difficulties, including <sym>trouble falling asleep, waking frequently, and reduced sleep duration</sym>, are contributing to your sense of exhaustion and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a major concern, with ongoing <sym>worry, tension, and avoidance of situations that provoke anxiety</sym>. You\u2019ve also disclosed <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and recent <sym>use of alcohol, smoking, and non-prescribed medications</sym> as ways to cope. Additionally, feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as <quote>feeling like I\u2019m watching myself from outside</quote>, and <sym>disturbing recurring thoughts or images</sym> further complicate your emotional landscape. These symptoms collectively suggest you are facing significant mental health difficulties that warrant comprehensive attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Self-Harm Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry, tension, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, support a concurrent <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or an anxiety component within mood disorder. The explicit report of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates increased risk, requiring urgent safety assessment. The dissociative experiences and cognitive issues suggest possible trauma-related or dissociative features, which can often coexist with mood and anxiety disorders. The substance use, including <sym>alcohol and tobacco</sym>, may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, complicating the clinical picture. Given the multifaceted nature of your symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Mood Disorder with Anxiety Features and Self-Harm Risk</med> best captures your current state.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate immediate risk related to <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider pharmacological treatment options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.  \n3. Engage in evidence-based psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and maladaptive coping strategies, including substance use.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical consultation for sleep management.  \n5. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms are persistent or linked to past trauma.  \n6. Consider support for substance use, including counseling for alcohol and tobacco use, to reduce reliance on substances as coping mechanisms.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
