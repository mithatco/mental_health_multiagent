This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

The absence of psychotic features or active suicidal ideation indicates a moderate to severe presentation, warranting intervention but not immediate crisis management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Encourage the patient to seek a comprehensive clinical evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Consider initiating or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, under medical supervision.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n5.

The individual also reports physical manifestations of anxiety, including muscle tension and gastrointestinal discomfort, alongside social withdrawal evidenced by feelings of emotional distance from loved ones.\n\nPatterns observed indicate co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment related to sleep disruption, social disconnection, and maladaptive coping behaviors such as compulsive checking. The patient denies psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation, though experiences intense anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed. No substance use or self-harm ideation is reported.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include major depressive disorder with anxious features, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible panic disorder.

Risk factors are primarily related to functional impairment and emotional distress, with no immediate indications of imminent self-harm.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, characterized by mood disturbance, anxious arousal, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal, suggesting a need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and targeted intervention.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed all 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level 1 measure, covering all relevant symptom domains. The questions were asked systematically and in sequence, ensuring comprehensive coverage. However, the follow-up questions were somewhat superficial, especially regarding more nuanced symptoms like psychosis or substance use. Some domains, such as dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use, were mentioned only briefly without deeper probing. While overall thorough, the conversation could have included more exploration or clarification within certain domains to reach a perfect score.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions posed closely align with DSM-5 criteria, using appropriate clinical terminology (e.g., 'feeling on edge,' 'panic,' 'hopelessness'). The phrasing is generally clear and relevant. There are minor concerns about some questions, such as the phrasing of physical symptoms and sleep disturbance, which could be more precise (e.g., specifying duration or impact). Nonetheless, the questions effectively target core symptoms without ambiguity. Slight improvements in wording could enhance clinical accuracy, but overall, the questions are relevant and appropriate.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flows logically in a broad sense, with questions following a logical progression from mood to physical symptoms and social functioning. However, there are some minor abrupt transitions, such as moving from sleep questions to memory issues without explicit linking or follow-up. Additionally, the therapist does not consistently follow up on key disclosures, such as the panic attacks or social withdrawal, which could disrupt the coherence and depth of assessment. The dialogue remains generally coherent but lacks the nuanced probing that would enhance flow and exploration.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Features is supported by the patient's reported symptoms, and the reasoning references DSM-5 criteria. However, the justification remains somewhat superficial, with the clinician summarizing symptoms without explicitly linking each to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (e.g., specifying duration, intensity, and impact). There is an assumption that the symptoms meet criteria without detailed differential diagnosis considerations or ruling out other disorders such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related conditions. The justification is generally sound but could be more detailed and explicit in connecting symptoms to DSM-5 diagnostic standards.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional and respectful tone, clearly explaining the purpose of the assessment and acknowledging the patient's distress with empathetic language. The responses are warm and nonjudgmental, which fosters comfort. However, the therapist could have demonstrated more active empathic engagement, such as explicitly validating the patient's feelings or summarizing emotional experiences to deepen rapport. Overall, the tone is appropriate and empathetic but slightly reserved, lacking some warmth or personalized acknowledgment that would elevate it to a 5."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the conversation demonstrates a solid and systematic approach to DSM-5 symptom assessment, covering all relevant domains with appropriate clinical relevance. The flow is generally coherent, and the reasoning for diagnosis aligns with the patient's reported symptoms. Nevertheless, there are notable areas for improvement: the depth of follow-up questions within certain domains is limited, and the diagnostic justification could be more explicit and nuanced. The dialogue maintains professionalism and warmth but could benefit from more active empathic engagement. In sum, this is a well-constructed assessment with minor weaknesses that prevent it from achieving the highest possible scores across all categories.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of challenging symptoms that indicate you're experiencing significant distress across multiple areas of your mental health. You describe persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, losing interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your ongoing <sym>worry</sym> and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> seem to be affecting your daily life, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> have added to your discomfort. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, further contribute to your fatigue and cognitive issues like forgetfulness. Physical symptoms such as muscle tension and stomachaches are also present, alongside social withdrawal and feelings of emotional distance from loved ones. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are causing you considerable emotional and functional impairment, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low energy</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and physical symptoms like muscle tension and gastrointestinal discomfort suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically generalized anxiety features. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. The absence of psychotic features or active suicidal ideation indicates a moderate to severe presentation, warranting intervention but not immediate crisis management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Encourage the patient to seek a comprehensive clinical evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Consider initiating or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, under medical supervision.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disturbances.  \n5. Explore social support options and develop coping strategies to reduce social withdrawal and improve emotional connection with loved ones.",
