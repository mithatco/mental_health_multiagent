The patient reports somatic symptoms such as unexplained headaches, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances characterized by frequent awakenings. Cognitive anomalies are noted, including forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar settings. Psychotic phenomena are present, including auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting sensations, which are distressing and unsettling. Additionally, the patient reports feelings of depersonalization, derealization, and dissociative experiences, alongside negative perceptions of interpersonal relationships and social withdrawal. The presence of suicidal ideation is explicitly noted, representing a significant clinical risk factor. Substance use, evidenced by occasional smoking and increased alcohol intake over a few days, warrants further assessment regarding self-medication or coping mechanisms. Overall, the patient's symptomatology suggests a complex presentation with mood, anxiety, psychotic, and somatic features, requiring comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning.",

Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and concerns about your <sym>relationships</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are significantly affecting your daily life and well-being, and your willingness to share openly is an important step toward understanding and addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features (likely Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features) and comorbid Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down, hopelessness, lack of interest in activities</quote>, along with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety episodes</sym> including <sym>panic attacks</sym>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> such as <quote>hearing faint voices and sounds that others don\u2019t notice</quote> and <sym>thought broadcasting</sym> suggests a psychotic component associated with a mood disorder. The <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>perceptual disturbances</sym> further support this impression. Physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>, combined with sleep disruption, suggest significant distress affecting multiple domains. The explicit mention of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> raises concern for acute risk, and the overall symptom profile points toward a <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features</med>. While anxiety symptoms are prominent, they appear to be secondary to the mood and psychotic symptoms rather than a primary anxiety disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Urgently assess and ensure the patient\u2019s safety given the <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, including a risk assessment and potential hospital admission if necessary.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for <med>psychotic</med> and <med>mood</med> disorder features, including standardized assessments.  \n3. Consider pharmacological treatment with antidepressants and antipsychotics, tailored to the patient\u2019s specific needs and safety considerations.  \n4. Provide immediate psychosocial support, including risk management and psychoeducation about symptoms.  \n5. Arrange for ongoing psychotherapy aimed at managing <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy.  \n6. Engage a multidisciplinary team for holistic care, including possible consultation with a psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.",
