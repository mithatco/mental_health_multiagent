Additionally, somatic complaints like headaches and stomachaches are present, and you've shared <quote>dark thoughts</quote> of self-harm, which, while not acted upon, are concerning.

The report of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> further support this assessment. While somatic complaints are common in depression and anxiety, they should be evaluated in context, considering medical causes if necessary, but given the psychological symptoms, a primary mood and anxiety disorder diagnosis is most fitting at this point.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including medical assessment to rule out physical causes of somatic symptoms.  \n2. Initiate or consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, improve coping skills, and explore feelings of dissociation.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Develop a safety plan to monitor and address passive suicidal thoughts, ensuring the patient has immediate support if needed.  \n5. Consider involving support systems, like family or close friends, with the patient\u2019s consent, to provide additional emotional support.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, persistent low mood, irritability, and fatigue. The patient reports substantial sleep disturbances characterized by increased sleep duration coupled with restlessness and non-restorative sleep. There are notable cognitive concerns, including memory impairment and feelings of dissociation or depersonalization, suggesting potential dissociative features. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of excessive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and social withdrawal, which may contribute to functional impairment. The patient also endorses somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, which may be psychosomatic or stress-related. \n\nPattern analysis reveals a pattern of emotional numbing, social isolation, and self-questioning, accompanied by passive suicidal ideation without active intent. The presence of dark thoughts and feelings of disconnection are clinical warning signs requiring careful assessment for suicide risk. No auditory or thought broadcasting phenomena are reported, reducing suspicion of psychosis at this time.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive episodes, comorbid anxiety disorder, and dissociative experiences. The patient\u2019s social withdrawal, self-critical thoughts, and passive suicidal ideation warrant close monitoring. The reported sleep and cognitive difficulties further complicate the clinical picture, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation and tailored intervention planning.",

      "expected": "adjustment",
      "predicted": "The responses you've shared reveal a complex picture of emotional distress, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties. You describe persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym>, along with diminished interest in activities that once brought you pleasure. There's also significant <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym>, as well as ongoing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by increased sleep and restlessness. You mention experiencing <sym>memory problems</sym> and episodes of feeling detached or outside of yourself, which can be very unsettling. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and avoidance behaviors, leading to social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection. Additionally, somatic complaints like headaches and stomachaches are present, and you've shared <quote>dark thoughts</quote> of self-harm, which, while not acted upon, are concerning. Overall, this indicates a significant level of emotional and psychological distress impacting various areas of your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Features and Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of intense <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>excessive worry</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of feeling detached from oneself and the experience of dissociative-like symptoms point toward <med>dissociative features</med>. The report of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> further support this assessment. While somatic complaints are common in depression and anxiety, they should be evaluated in context, considering medical causes if necessary, but given the psychological symptoms, a primary mood and anxiety disorder diagnosis is most fitting at this point.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including medical assessment to rule out physical causes of somatic symptoms.  \n2. Initiate or consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, improve coping skills, and explore feelings of dissociation.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Develop a safety plan to monitor and address passive suicidal thoughts, ensuring the patient has immediate support if needed.  \n5. Consider involving support systems, like family or close friends, with the patient\u2019s consent, to provide additional emotional support.",
