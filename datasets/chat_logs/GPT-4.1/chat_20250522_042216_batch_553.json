Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment includes 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and I appreciate your openness. Are you ready to begin?"

You also described difficulty sleeping, feelings of being disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and challenges with concentration and memory. Your reports of social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and thoughts about death, even without plans to harm yourself, suggest you're going through a very tough time. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming and isolating, and your openness in sharing this is a positive step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms indicate a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym>. The sleep disturbance, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, avoidance, and irritability</sym> point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, reports of <sym>derealization or depersonalization experiences</sym> suggest dissociative features. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> heighten concern but do not indicate active intent or plans, though they warrant close monitoring. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or other complicating factors supports a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with an antidepressant such as an SSRI or SNRI, considering the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Refer the patient for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address hopelessness, improve coping skills, and manage anxiety.  \n3. Conduct a thorough <med>risk assessment</med> for suicidality, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly and consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management and further evaluation.  \n5. Encourage social engagement and support networks, and explore strategies to reduce social withdrawal gradually.  \n6. Evaluate for any underlying medical conditions contributing to somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient exhibits prominent symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode, characterized by persistent anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), pervasive feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, and disturbances in sleep (early awakening and non-restorative sleep). There is also evidence of cognitive impairment, including concentration difficulties and memory issues, alongside psychomotor retardation or fatigue. The patient's affective state appears markedly depressed, with reports of emotional numbing and feelings of emptiness.\n\nAnxious features are evident, notably generalized anxiety and worry about the future, accompanied by avoidance behaviors such as social withdrawal and staying home to mitigate anxiety-provoking situations. The patient reports episodes of transient fear or panic and experiences somatic symptoms such as unexplained headaches and body aches, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress or somatization.\n\nThe presence of passive suicidal ideation\u2014thoughts about death without plans or intent\u2014is noted, which warrants careful assessment for suicide risk. The feelings of disconnection from self and others, including derealization or depersonalization, suggest possible dissociative symptoms or a sense of emotional numbness.\n\nNo indications of hallucinations, delusional thoughts, or substance misuse are reported. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of being misunderstood or not taken seriously are notable and may contribute to social isolation.\n\n**Patterns & Clinical Significance:**\n\n- Core depressive symptoms: anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment.\n- Comorbid anxious symptoms: persistent worry, avoidance, irritability.\n- Somatic complaints: headaches and body aches.\n- Dissociative experiences: feeling detached from self and surroundings.\n- Passive suicidal ideation without active plans.\n- Social withdrawal and emotional disconnection.\n\n**Risk Factors & Warning Signs:**\n\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, which require close monitoring and risk assessment.\n- Significant social withdrawal and anhedonia, increasing vulnerability to worsening depression.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emptiness.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of moderate to severe depression, compounded by comorbid anxiety features and dissociative experiences. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and social withdrawal are clinical concerns that necessitate thorough risk assessment and ongoing monitoring. The symptom profile underscores the need for a comprehensive treatment approach addressing mood, cognition, anxiety, and social functioning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience marked by persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, and loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>. You also described difficulty sleeping, feelings of being disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and challenges with concentration and memory. Your reports of social withdrawal, emotional numbness, and thoughts about death, even without plans to harm yourself, suggest you're going through a very tough time. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming and isolating, and your openness in sharing this is a positive step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms indicate a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym>. The sleep disturbance, cognitive impairments, and somatic complaints support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, avoidance, and irritability</sym> point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, reports of <sym>derealization or depersonalization experiences</sym> suggest dissociative features. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> heighten concern but do not indicate active intent or plans, though they warrant close monitoring. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or other complicating factors supports a primary diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with an antidepressant such as an SSRI or SNRI, considering the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Refer the patient for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address hopelessness, improve coping skills, and manage anxiety.  \n3. Conduct a thorough <med>risk assessment</med> for suicidality, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Monitor symptoms regularly and consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management and further evaluation.  \n5. Encourage social engagement and support networks, and explore strategies to reduce social withdrawal gradually.  \n6. Evaluate for any underlying medical conditions contributing to somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances.",
