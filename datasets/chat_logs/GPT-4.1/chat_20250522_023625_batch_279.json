You also mentioned episodes of crying without clear reason and a sense of emotional numbness, which can be very overwhelming. Your anxiety is significant, with constant worries and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that feel frightening, along with avoidance of social situations that exacerbate your feelings of being overwhelmed. Sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and feeling exhausted despite increased sleep, add to your sense of fatigue. You also described somatic symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings. These symptoms collectively point to a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, which can be very challenging to manage alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and irritability, all lasting over two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors fulfills criteria for comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbance, characterized by difficulty sleeping despite increased sleep duration, along with somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, further supports this diagnosis. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling detached suggest dissociative symptoms that can occur with severe depression and anxiety. No evidence of psychosis, active suicidal ideation, or substance misuse is noted, which guides the diagnosis toward depression with significant anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, such as antidepressants with anxiolytic properties, tailored to reduce <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious symptoms</sym>.  \n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education, and evaluate for possible sleep disorders if symptoms persist.  \n4. Monitor for safety, especially regarding thoughts of self-harm, and provide crisis resources as needed.  \n5. Encourage regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response, mood stability, and any emerging symptoms.",

They report significant sleep disturbances, including difficulty sleeping despite increased sleep duration, and episodic feelings of panic and heightened anxiety, accompanied by avoidance of social situations. Somatic complaints, such as frequent headaches and stomachaches, are noted, and the patient reports intrusive, distressing thoughts, alongside a sense of emotional numbness or dissociation (feeling detached from self and surroundings). Cognitive concerns include occasional forgetfulness and disorientation.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent theme of emotional dysregulation, anhedonia, and social isolation, with notable anxiety symptoms and intrusive thoughts. The absence of current suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or compulsive behaviors suggests no immediate risk of self-harm or psychosis at this time. Substance use appears minimal, with no reported misuse of alcohol or drugs.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety features, and possibly dissociative symptoms. The patient's social withdrawal, sleep difficulties, and intrusive thoughts merit close monitoring. While no overt risk factors such as active suicidal thoughts or substance misuse are present, the severity of mood symptoms and functional impairment warrant ongoing assessment and intervention.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive mood, anxiety, somatic complaints, dissociative feelings, and social withdrawal, requiring a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, sleep, and cognitive symptoms.",

      "expected": "adjustment",
      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience characterized by persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned episodes of crying without clear reason and a sense of emotional numbness, which can be very overwhelming. Your anxiety is significant, with constant worries and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that feel frightening, along with avoidance of social situations that exacerbate your feelings of being overwhelmed. Sleep difficulties, including trouble falling asleep and feeling exhausted despite increased sleep, add to your sense of fatigue. You also described somatic symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings. These symptoms collectively point to a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, which can be very challenging to manage alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and irritability, all lasting over two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors fulfills criteria for comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbance, characterized by difficulty sleeping despite increased sleep duration, along with somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, further supports this diagnosis. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feeling detached suggest dissociative symptoms that can occur with severe depression and anxiety. No evidence of psychosis, active suicidal ideation, or substance misuse is noted, which guides the diagnosis toward depression with significant anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.  \n2. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, such as antidepressants with anxiolytic properties, tailored to reduce <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious symptoms</sym>.  \n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education, and evaluate for possible sleep disorders if symptoms persist.  \n4. Monitor for safety, especially regarding thoughts of self-harm, and provide crisis resources as needed.  \n5. Encourage regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response, mood stability, and any emerging symptoms.",
