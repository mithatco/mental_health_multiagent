      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, which has left you feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>stuck</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> more often and experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially around social situations, where you worry about embarrassing yourself and tend to avoid social gatherings altogether. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, have been affecting your overall energy and mood. Additionally, you experience some <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and a sense of <sym>social isolation</sym>. Importantly, you do not report any <sym>thoughts of self-harm or suicidality</sym>, nor do you have signs of <sym>psychosis</sym>. Your experiences seem to reflect a combination of mood and anxiety symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily life, especially your social functioning and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> comorbid with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>significant anxiety</sym> related to social situations, characterized by avoidance, worry about embarrassment, and panic-like episodes, suggests comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodic panic symptoms, especially in social contexts, further support this diagnosis. The sleep disturbances and intrusive negative thoughts are consistent with depressive and anxiety symptomatology. The absence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, <sym>psychotic features</sym>, or <sym>medical somatic complaints</sym> indicates these are not currently prominent concerns but should be monitored. Overall, the clinical picture points to a combined mood and anxiety disorder profile that requires integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity, including standardized scales for depression and anxiety.  \n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression and social anxiety.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), especially if symptoms impair daily functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n5. Monitor for any emergence of suicidal ideation or worsening symptoms, and provide crisis resources if needed.  \n6. Consider a multidisciplinary approach involving mental health professionals and primary care providers to ensure comprehensive care.",

They also describe notable anxiety features, including social anxiety manifested by anticipatory worry, avoidance behaviors, and episodic panic attacks, indicating possible social anxiety disorder or comorbid panic symptoms. \n\nThe patient exhibits cognitive and somatic concerns, including sleep disturbances (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) and somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, which are attributed to stress and anxiety. They acknowledge intrusive negative thoughts and ruminations but deny compulsive behaviors or obsessive rituals. Dissociative experiences are absent, and there are no indications of psychosis or paranoid ideation. \n\nA key pattern emerges around social withdrawal, anhedonia, and heightened anxiety, particularly in social contexts, aligning with social anxiety. The patient denies suicidality, self-harm, substance use, or recent medication misuse, suggesting no immediate risk of harm but ongoing emotional distress.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep disturbance\n- Social anxiety and avoidance behaviors\n- Panic symptoms triggered by social situations\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and general distress\n- Feelings of social isolation and emotional withdrawal\n\n**Risk factors or warning signs:**\n- Persistent hopelessness and anhedonia warrant close monitoring for potential escalation of depressive symptoms\n- Anxiety and avoidance behaviors may impair functioning\n- No current suicidality or self-harm thoughts reported, reducing immediate risk but requiring ongoing assessment\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a clinical profile indicative of moderate depressive symptoms co-occurring with social anxiety and panic features. Their affective and cognitive symptoms, along with social withdrawal, suggest an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, necessitating further diagnostic clarification and tailored intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, which has left you feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>stuck</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> more often and experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially around social situations, where you worry about embarrassing yourself and tend to avoid social gatherings altogether. Sleep difficulties, such as trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, have been affecting your overall energy and mood. Additionally, you experience some <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and a sense of <sym>social isolation</sym>. Importantly, you do not report any <sym>thoughts of self-harm or suicidality</sym>, nor do you have signs of <sym>psychosis</sym>. Your experiences seem to reflect a combination of mood and anxiety symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily life, especially your social functioning and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> comorbid with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>significant anxiety</sym> related to social situations, characterized by avoidance, worry about embarrassment, and panic-like episodes, suggests comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodic panic symptoms, especially in social contexts, further support this diagnosis. The sleep disturbances and intrusive negative thoughts are consistent with depressive and anxiety symptomatology. The absence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, <sym>psychotic features</sym>, or <sym>medical somatic complaints</sym> indicates these are not currently prominent concerns but should be monitored. Overall, the clinical picture points to a combined mood and anxiety disorder profile that requires integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive assessment to confirm diagnoses and evaluate severity, including standardized scales for depression and anxiety.  \n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression and social anxiety.  \n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), especially if symptoms impair daily functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n5. Monitor for any emergence of suicidal ideation or worsening symptoms, and provide crisis resources if needed.  \n6. Consider a multidisciplinary approach involving mental health professionals and primary care providers to ensure comprehensive care.",
