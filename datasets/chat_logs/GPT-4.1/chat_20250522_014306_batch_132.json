This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to gather information that can guide our discussion and any future treatment. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask each question, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

Sleep disturbances, such as waking up very early and feeling exhausted during the day, seem to be affecting your energy levels and overall well-being. You've also mentioned difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>mental fog</sym>, which can be quite frustrating. Additionally, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially when thinking about your job or things outside your control, and tend to withdraw socially because it feels overwhelming.

The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues such as forgetfulness, and physical complaints further support this diagnosis.

The mention of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful monitoring, but no active plans are reported. The overall presentation suggests a moderate to severe level of depression complicated by anxiety features, leading to significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk and potential comorbidities.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) and consider referral for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate, and explore possible physical health factors contributing to somatic complaints.  \n4. Establish a safety plan and provide resources for crisis support given passive suicidal thoughts.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and overall functioning.",

There is evidence of cognitive impairment, including forgetfulness and mental fog, which may contribute to overall functional decline. The patient also describes symptoms of anxiety, including generalized worry, tension, and avoidance behaviors related to social situations. Physical complaints such as unexplained headaches and body aches are present, potentially reflecting somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nPattern analysis indicates a co-occurrence of depressive and anxious symptomatology, with social withdrawal and anhedonia being prominent. The absence of irritability, panic attacks, or impulsive behaviors reduces the likelihood of certain mood or impulse-control disorders but emphasizes the prominence of internalizing symptoms.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Major depressive disorder, characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- Generalized anxiety features, evidenced by worry, tension, and avoidance.\n- Somatic complaints possibly related to psychosomatic processes.\n- Risk factors for suicidality are indicated by occasional passive thoughts of self-harm, although no plans or intent are reported.\n\nWarning signs include passive suicidal ideation, social withdrawal, and feelings of losing oneself, which warrant ongoing assessment for suicide risk. No current substance misuse behaviors or disinhibition are identified.\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests a complex internalizing disorder with significant functional impairment, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very honest and detailed account of how you've been feeling lately. It sounds like you're experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that used to bring you joy, along with feelings of <sym>emptiness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as waking up very early and feeling exhausted during the day, seem to be affecting your energy levels and overall well-being. You've also mentioned difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>mental fog</sym>, which can be quite frustrating. Additionally, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially when thinking about your job or things outside your control, and tend to withdraw socially because it feels overwhelming. The physical symptoms like headaches and body aches may be linked to your emotional state, and you have occasionally had <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. It\u2019s clear that these experiences are impacting your daily life and emotional health, and your willingness to share this is an important step toward understanding and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate to Severe, with Anxious Distress**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues such as forgetfulness, and physical complaints further support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including worry, tension, and social avoidance, indicate comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or an anxious distress component. The mention of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> warrants careful monitoring, but no active plans are reported. The overall presentation suggests a moderate to severe level of depression complicated by anxiety features, leading to significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment of suicide risk and potential comorbidities.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) and consider referral for <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate, and explore possible physical health factors contributing to somatic complaints.  \n4. Establish a safety plan and provide resources for crisis support given passive suicidal thoughts.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and overall functioning.",
