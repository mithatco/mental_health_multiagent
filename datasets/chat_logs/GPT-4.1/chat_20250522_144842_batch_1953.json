They report diminished interest in activities, pervasive low mood, and a sense of emotional overwhelm. Anxiety manifests through heightened worry, social fears, and panic attacks, with avoidance behaviors evident in social settings. Sleep disturbances are characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, coupled with subjective restlessness and fatigue. Cognitive concerns include memory impairment and episodes of confusion about identity and life goals. Intrusive thoughts and obsessive tendencies are noted, though without compulsive behaviors. The patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, which they attribute to stress.\n\nPatterns of concern include mood disturbance (depression), anxiety symptoms (worry, social avoidance, panic), sleep disruption, and cognitive difficulties. Social withdrawal and feelings of emotional detachment suggest social isolation and possible anhedonia. The presence of passive suicidal ideation, albeit without intent or plans, is a critical risk factor requiring ongoing assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and possible comorbid somatic symptom issues. The patient's self-reported passive suicidal thoughts necessitate careful risk evaluation. Overall, the symptom profile indicates significant emotional distress impacting multiple domains of functioning, warranting a comprehensive clinical assessment and appropriate intervention planning.",

Additionally, they describe <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> like headaches and stomachaches. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, though not accompanied by intent or plans, indicates significant distress and risk that warrants careful monitoring. Overall, the individual demonstrates symptoms across mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic domains, suggesting a need for comprehensive clinical evaluation and targeted intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with prominent anxiety features, possibly comorbid social anxiety disorder and cognitive disturbances\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> and <med>social anxiety disorder</med>. Reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and intrusive thoughts support the complexity of the presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates a need for risk assessment and safety planning. While somatic complaints are noted, they are likely manifestations of underlying mood and anxiety symptoms rather than a primary <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>. Overall, this constellation of symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety features, requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and safety planning.\n2. Initiate or refer for evidence-based treatment, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with efficacy for depression and anxiety, after a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medication.\n5. Monitor cognitive symptoms and explore psychoeducation or cognitive remediation strategies.\n6. Provide support for social withdrawal and facilitate gradual social engagement when appropriate.\n7. Arrange follow-up to reassess symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
