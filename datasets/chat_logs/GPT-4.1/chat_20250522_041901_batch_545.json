This assessment helps us get a broad overview of your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The questionnaire includes 23 questions covering various areas of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn.

The overall presentation warrants attention to multiple overlapping conditions, potentially including comorbid mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history and possible neurocognitive testing, to clarify diagnoses and rule out medical conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and impact of symptoms.  \n4. Implement safety planning and regular risk assessment regarding <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, ensuring the patient has support and resources available.  \n5.

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and diminished interest in activities, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and pervasive low mood. These depressive symptoms are coupled with significant irritability, heightened anxiety, and occasional panic attacks, suggesting comorbid anxiety features. Sleep disturbance is notable, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, alongside reports of increased energy and restlessness despite poor sleep quality, which may reflect a mood or anxiety component.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are reported, including episodes of dissociation (feeling detached from self and environment) and forgetfulness, which may warrant further neurocognitive assessment. Intrusive, distressing thoughts\u2014particularly about contamination and harm\u2014along with compulsive behaviors such as extensive handwashing and checking, align with features of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. The patient also reports passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan, indicating moderate risk requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\nSocial withdrawal and anhedonia extend to interpersonal domains, with diminished interest in socializing and feelings of disconnection from others. Somatic complaints, such as headaches and muscle aches, are acknowledged but attributed to stress, though they may warrant further medical evaluation.\n\nNo current substance use or medication misuse is reported, reducing immediate concerns regarding substance-related risks. However, the presence of dark thoughts and compulsive behaviors necessitates careful risk assessment and safety planning.\n\nPatterns observed include a combination of mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences, obsessive-compulsive features, and social withdrawal. These findings suggest a complex mood-anxiety disorder with obsessive-compulsive features, requiring comprehensive diagnostic clarification and targeted intervention.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, dissociation, and intrusive thoughts, underscoring the importance of safety monitoring and possibly crisis intervention.",

      "expected": "ocd",
      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex constellation of symptoms that significantly impact their mood, cognition, and daily functioning. They report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Additionally, they experience notable <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings. Their reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors such as excessive handwashing and checking, suggest <med>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</med>. The patient also describes episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and forgetfulness, which may indicate dissociative features or cognitive concerns. Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection further compound their distress. While they deny auditory or visual hallucinations, the presence of dark <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> emphasizes the importance of safety monitoring. Overall, their presentation reflects a multifaceted mental health challenge with mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative components.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Persistent Depressive Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks suggest a depressive disorder, likely <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The significant <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and panic attacks point to comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts align with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The dissociative sensations and forgetfulness may indicate dissociative symptoms or cognitive effects related to mood and anxiety. The absence of hallucinations or delusions makes <med>psychotic disorders</med> less likely at this stage. The overall presentation warrants attention to multiple overlapping conditions, potentially including comorbid mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history and possible neurocognitive testing, to clarify diagnoses and rule out medical conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity and impact of symptoms.  \n4. Implement safety planning and regular risk assessment regarding <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, ensuring the patient has support and resources available.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical evaluation for underlying sleep disorders.",
