Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get a broad picture of how you're feeling and functioning across different areas of mental health. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open and honest. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I will ask each question, and I'd like you to answer in your own words, describing your experiences over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and avoidance behaviors highlight significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>. Additionally, your ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and medications beyond prescription\u2014appears to be a way of coping with stress and emotional pain. It\u2019s understandable that these struggles have affected your relationships and sense of identity, leaving you feeling lost and disconnected. Your honesty is important, and it\u2019s a crucial step toward understanding and addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder with hypomanic features) combined with Moderate to Severe Substance Use Disorder and Significant Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes symptoms consistent with <med>bipolar disorder</med>, particularly <sym>episodes of elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, increased risk-taking</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The persistent low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and anhedonia suggest a <med>depressive episode</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> with <sym>high energy</sym> and <sym>risk behaviors</sym> point toward <med>hypomanic features</med>. The reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate comorbid <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. The problematic <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, tobacco, and unprescribed medications, suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative experiences and cognitive issues could be related to substance effects or underlying psychiatric conditions. Given the constellation of symptoms and their impact on functioning, a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid substance use and anxiety features is the most fitting provisional impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the mood disorder diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that includes mood stabilization (possibly medication), psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), and substance use treatment.  \n3. Address safety concerns immediately, including risk of self-harm, with safety planning and possibly hospitalization if necessary.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood disorders, substance use, and anxiety management strategies.  \n5. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and a substance use specialist for detoxification or rehabilitation support.  \n6. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or loved ones in treatment planning if appropriate.",

Key symptoms include anhedonia, persistent low mood, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and irritability, with reports of decreased sleep coupled with sustained or elevated energy levels\u2014suggestive of potential mood dysregulation or hypomanic features. The patient reports increased risk-taking behaviors, substance use (including alcohol, cigarettes, and other substances), and use of medications beyond prescribed limits, highlighting problematic substance use patterns and possible self-medication.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by pervasive worry, agitation, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, which may contribute to social withdrawal and interpersonal strain. The presence of dissociative experiences, such as feelings of detachment, and cognitive difficulties, including memory impairment and disorientation, raise concerns about neuropsychiatric effects associated with substance use or underlying mental health conditions.\n\nSuicidal ideation is explicitly reported, with thoughts of self-harm, indicating elevated risk and necessitating immediate clinical attention. The patient's physical complaints (aches, pains) may be psychosomatic or related to stress, but warrant further assessment. The pervasive sense of identity confusion and feelings of disconnection suggest derealization or depersonalization phenomena, which may be associated with trauma, dissociative symptoms, or substance effects.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal a complex clinical picture characterized by mood instability, substance dependence, anxiety, dissociation, cognitive disturbances, and risk behaviors. These factors collectively suggest the need for comprehensive assessment, including evaluation for mood disorders, substance use disorder, anxiety disorders, and potential trauma-related pathology.\n\nRisks include suicidal ideation, substance overdose, and self-harm behaviors, underscoring the importance of safety planning. The patient's self-reported use of substances and medications without medical oversight, coupled with symptoms of impulsivity and disconnection, highlight the need for urgent intervention and coordinated care.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant affective, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances with concurrent substance use issues and risk factors for self-harm, warranting a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach and immediate safety assessment.",

      "predicted": "You are clearly going through a very difficult time, experiencing a complex mix of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with irritability and increased <sym>risk-taking</sym> behaviors such as substance use. Your sleep pattern is disrupted, with <sym>less sleep but sustained energy</sym>, and you\u2019ve described <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are serious concerns. You also experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like detachment, as well as cognitive difficulties such as <sym>memory problems</sym>. Your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and avoidance behaviors highlight significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>. Additionally, your ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and medications beyond prescription\u2014appears to be a way of coping with stress and emotional pain. It\u2019s understandable that these struggles have affected your relationships and sense of identity, leaving you feeling lost and disconnected. Your honesty is important, and it\u2019s a crucial step toward understanding and addressing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder with hypomanic features) combined with Moderate to Severe Substance Use Disorder and Significant Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes symptoms consistent with <med>bipolar disorder</med>, particularly <sym>episodes of elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, increased risk-taking</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The persistent low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and anhedonia suggest a <med>depressive episode</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> with <sym>high energy</sym> and <sym>risk behaviors</sym> point toward <med>hypomanic features</med>. The reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate comorbid <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. The problematic <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, tobacco, and unprescribed medications, suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative experiences and cognitive issues could be related to substance effects or underlying psychiatric conditions. Given the constellation of symptoms and their impact on functioning, a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid substance use and anxiety features is the most fitting provisional impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the mood disorder diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that includes mood stabilization (possibly medication), psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy), and substance use treatment.  \n3. Address safety concerns immediately, including risk of self-harm, with safety planning and possibly hospitalization if necessary.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood disorders, substance use, and anxiety management strategies.  \n5. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and a substance use specialist for detoxification or rehabilitation support.  \n6. Explore social support systems and consider involving family or loved ones in treatment planning if appropriate.",
