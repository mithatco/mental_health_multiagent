Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive environment for you. This assessment includes 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, and others, and I will ask each one in turn. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just answer honestly based on how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin?"

It sounds like you've been struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> like <quote>feeling pretty down and hopeless most days</quote>, as well as a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>anxiety and panic attacks</sym> that can be intense and frightening, leading to avoidance of certain situations. Sleep problems, such as difficulty falling asleep and waking up multiple times, are affecting your overall rest. Additionally, you\u2019ve noticed some <sym>cognitive concerns</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected at times, along with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle aches. Despite these challenges, you\u2019ve been managing without substance misuse or psychotic symptoms, but the emotional distress and social withdrawal are significant. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it\u2019s important to recognize that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, diminished interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety, excessive worry, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of intense, uncontrollable <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with situational avoidance, are characteristic of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive complaints, and social withdrawal further support these diagnoses. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or significant medical comorbidities suggests these are primary mood and anxiety disorders rather than somatic or psychotic disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess severity, and evaluate suicide risk.\n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms.\n3. Discuss pharmacotherapy options, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), which can be effective for both depression and anxiety.\n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medication.\n5. Explore social support and coping strategies to reduce isolation and improve functioning.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, treatment adherence, and any emerging concerns.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities, along with persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional withdrawal. There is evidence of mood disturbance characterized by feelings of worthlessness or self-doubt, coupled with recurrent thoughts of self-harm or death, although no current intent or plans are reported. Anxiety symptoms are significant, with frequent experiences of generalized worry, heightened irritability, and avoidance behaviors linked to panic attacks, including situational avoidance of crowded places and public transportation. The patient reports episodes of intense panic characterized by waves of terror, supporting a diagnosis consistent with panic disorder.\n\nSleep disturbance is notable, involving difficulty initiating and maintaining restful sleep, which may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory lapses and disorientation in familiar environments, warranting further neurocognitive assessment. Somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches are acknowledged, potentially related to stress or psychosomatic factors.\n\nThe patient denies psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or disordered compulsive behaviors. There is a subjective sense of emotional detachment and identity confusion, which may reflect dissociative experiences or depersonalization. Social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement are evident, possibly secondary to anxiety and mood symptoms.\n\nRisk factors include passive suicidal ideation without active planning, significant anxiety and panic episodes, and social isolation. No current substance abuse or external risk behaviors are identified.\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation is characterized by major depressive features, generalized and panic-related anxiety, sleep disturbance, cognitive concerns, and social withdrawal. Further assessment is recommended to evaluate severity, functional impairment, and potential comorbidities, with attention to suicide risk and neurocognitive functioning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about your feelings and experiences, and I want to acknowledge that it takes courage to discuss these personal matters. It sounds like you've been struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> like <quote>feeling pretty down and hopeless most days</quote>, as well as a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>anxiety and panic attacks</sym> that can be intense and frightening, leading to avoidance of certain situations. Sleep problems, such as difficulty falling asleep and waking up multiple times, are affecting your overall rest. Additionally, you\u2019ve noticed some <sym>cognitive concerns</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected at times, along with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle aches. Despite these challenges, you\u2019ve been managing without substance misuse or psychotic symptoms, but the emotional distress and social withdrawal are significant. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it\u2019s important to recognize that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, diminished interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety, excessive worry, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of intense, uncontrollable <sym>panic attacks</sym>, along with situational avoidance, are characteristic of <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive complaints, and social withdrawal further support these diagnoses. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or significant medical comorbidities suggests these are primary mood and anxiety disorders rather than somatic or psychotic disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess severity, and evaluate suicide risk.\n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and panic symptoms.\n3. Discuss pharmacotherapy options, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), which can be effective for both depression and anxiety.\n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medication.\n5. Explore social support and coping strategies to reduce isolation and improve functioning.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, treatment adherence, and any emerging concerns.",
