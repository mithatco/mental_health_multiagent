Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us get a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and more. I will ask you each question one by one, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

It sounds like you're experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where activities that once brought you joy no longer do.

Sleep difficulties, including waking frequently and feeling restless, seem to contribute to your overall sense of fatigue and disconnection. You also described intrusive <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and engaging in compulsive behaviors like excessive <sym>hand washing</sym>, which appear to be attempts to manage your anxiety. Additionally, you mentioned episodes of feeling <sym>detached from yourself</sym> and <sym>confused about your identity</sym>, along with some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Your social relationships seem strained, and you feel misunderstood by others regarding your symptoms. Overall, these symptoms suggest a significant level of emotional and cognitive distress that impacts your daily functioning, and it\u2019s commendable that you\u2019re sharing these feelings openly.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, unspecified</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of a <med>Mood Disorder</med>. The presence of chronic anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors indicates a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive rituals like handwashing and checking, align with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of dissociation, feeling detached from oneself and confusion about identity, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The combination of these symptoms points to a complex clinical picture that may involve multiple overlapping diagnoses. Given the severity and the range of symptoms, a thorough evaluation is essential to determine if there is an underlying <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or other mood pathology, but current features support a provisional diagnosis of an unspecified mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and OCD features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to clarify diagnoses, including screening for depression, anxiety, OCD, and dissociative disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan to address the passive thoughts of self-harm, ensuring close monitoring and support.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored for depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n4. Consider medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, pharmacologic interventions.  \n6. Explore interventions for dissociative symptoms and emotional regulation techniques to improve grounding and self-awareness.  \n7. Encourage social support and strategies to reconnect with relationships, possibly including family therapy if applicable.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggesting depressive symptomatology. The patient reports persistent low mood, emotional numbness, and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities, consistent with depressive features. There are also notable symptoms of irritability and difficulty with sleep, characterized by nocturnal awakenings and subjective restlessness, which may further exacerbate mood disturbances.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by chronic tension, worry about uncontrollable factors, and episodic panic sensations characterized by palpitations and dyspnea, alongside avoidance behaviors in response to anxiety-provoking situations. The patient also reports intrusive, distressing obsessive thoughts related to contamination and harm, accompanied by compulsive behaviors such as excessive handwashing and checking, indicating possible obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nCognitive concerns include recent memory lapses and disorientation, which warrant further evaluation. The patient describes dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and surroundings) and identity confusion, aligning with dissociative symptoms. Additionally, there are somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension, which may be stress-related.\n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without active planning, a significant risk factor requiring close monitoring. There is a sense of social withdrawal and difficulty maintaining relationships, possibly secondary to emotional withdrawal and reassurance-seeking behaviors.\n\nPatterns of concern include comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms, compulsive rituals, dissociative experiences, and passive suicidal thoughts. No substance use of concern was reported.\n\nClinical significance centers on the coexistence of depressive, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, which may complicate diagnosis and treatment planning. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and dissociative experiences warrants safety assessment and careful monitoring.\n\nRisk factors/warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts, dissociation, and significant functional impairment. Further assessment of the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as risk management, is recommended to inform diagnostic formulation and intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional, cognitive, and physical distress. It sounds like you're experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where activities that once brought you joy no longer do. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> most of the time, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are quite frightening. Sleep difficulties, including waking frequently and feeling restless, seem to contribute to your overall sense of fatigue and disconnection. You also described intrusive <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and engaging in compulsive behaviors like excessive <sym>hand washing</sym>, which appear to be attempts to manage your anxiety. Additionally, you mentioned episodes of feeling <sym>detached from yourself</sym> and <sym>confused about your identity</sym>, along with some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Your social relationships seem strained, and you feel misunderstood by others regarding your symptoms. Overall, these symptoms suggest a significant level of emotional and cognitive distress that impacts your daily functioning, and it\u2019s commendable that you\u2019re sharing these feelings openly.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, unspecified</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation, which are characteristic of a <med>Mood Disorder</med>. The presence of chronic anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors indicates a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> component. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive rituals like handwashing and checking, align with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of dissociation, feeling detached from oneself and confusion about identity, suggest <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The combination of these symptoms points to a complex clinical picture that may involve multiple overlapping diagnoses. Given the severity and the range of symptoms, a thorough evaluation is essential to determine if there is an underlying <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or other mood pathology, but current features support a provisional diagnosis of an unspecified mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and OCD features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to clarify diagnoses, including screening for depression, anxiety, OCD, and dissociative disorders.  \n2. Develop a safety plan to address the passive thoughts of self-harm, ensuring close monitoring and support.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored for depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n4. Consider medication management, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning.  \n5. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, pharmacologic interventions.  \n6. Explore interventions for dissociative symptoms and emotional regulation techniques to improve grounding and self-awareness.  \n7. Encourage social support and strategies to reconnect with relationships, possibly including family therapy if applicable.",
