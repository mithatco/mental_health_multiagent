This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a helpful tool to identify any symptoms that might be impacting your well-being and to guide potential next steps in your care. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms. I will ask each question one at a time, and I'd like you to answer as honestly and openly as you can. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Sleep has been difficult, with frequent awakenings and exhaustion during the day.

Additionally, you\u2019ve been avoiding certain situations out of fear of panic attacks and have withdrawn from social connections.

The presence of <sym>excessive worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, particularly Panic Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of dissociation further support a diagnosis involving significant mood and anxiety component. Although thoughts of self-harm are noted, the absence of active intent or plan means this remains a serious concern but not an immediate risk requiring inpatient intervention at this stage. Overall, the symptoms align with a complex presentation of depressive and anxiety features that warrant integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for suicidality, to ensure safety.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as combined psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring.\n4. Develop a sleep hygiene plan and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n5. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce social withdrawal.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",

Concurrently, there are significant anxiety symptoms characterized by persistent worry, heightened agitation, and avoidance behaviors related to panic and agoraphobic tendencies. The patient reports sleep disturbances marked by difficulty maintaining sleep and resultant daytime exhaustion, alongside physical manifestations such as headaches and muscle tension. Intrusive thoughts and feelings of dissociation further point to dissociative experiences or heightened anxiety responses. The patient's history of suicidal ideation, albeit without intent or plan, warrants careful monitoring. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse was noted. Social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement are evident, aligning with depressive and anxious symptomatology.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms suggests a complex mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features.\n- Avoidance behaviors and dissociative experiences may indicate underlying panic disorder or agoraphobic tendencies.\n- Sleep impairment and physical symptoms (headaches, muscle tension) reinforce the severity of stress and affect regulation difficulties.\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociative symptoms merit further exploration for possible comorbid dissociative or obsessive-compulsive features.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Presence of passive suicidal ideation increases clinical concern; immediate safety assessment is advised.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional withdrawal suggest potential risk for worsening mood state or suicidality.\n- Anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors could impair functioning and warrant targeted intervention.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation with significant depressive symptoms, pervasive anxiety, panic features, sleep disturbances, and dissociative experiences. These symptoms collectively suggest an overlapping mood and anxiety disorder, necessitating comprehensive assessment, safety evaluation, and an integrated treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that you\u2019re experiencing a range of challenging <sym>feelings of hopelessness, sadness, and loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. You\u2019ve also noticed increased <sym>irritability, anxiety, and physical symptoms like headaches and muscle tension</sym>. Sleep has been difficult, with frequent awakenings and exhaustion during the day. You mentioned <quote>thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> that have occurred during moments of overwhelm, and you sometimes feel disconnected or like things aren\u2019t quite real. Additionally, you\u2019ve been avoiding certain situations out of fear of panic attacks and have withdrawn from social connections. It\u2019s clear that these symptoms are significantly impacting your daily life and emotional well-being, and I want you to know this is a serious and understandable struggle.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Disorder (possibly Panic Disorder)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, particularly Panic Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of dissociation further support a diagnosis involving significant mood and anxiety component. Although thoughts of self-harm are noted, the absence of active intent or plan means this remains a serious concern but not an immediate risk requiring inpatient intervention at this stage. Overall, the symptoms align with a complex presentation of depressive and anxiety features that warrant integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for suicidality, to ensure safety.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as combined psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring.\n4. Develop a sleep hygiene plan and consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n5. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce social withdrawal.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
