We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health by asking about your experiences over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment includes 23 questions covering various domains such as mood, anxiety, energy, and others. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Honestly, it's been pretty mixed. Sometimes I don't feel like doing anything at all, especially when I'm in a down phase. Other times, I'm just so busy and distracted that I forget to enjoy things or I just don't care. It's like a rollercoaster."

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Yeah, I've had a lot of days where I just feel really hopeless, like nothing's going to get better. I sometimes feel worthless, especially during my low periods. But then, during my highs, I forget about it all for a while."
    },

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I see. Moving on to feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual. How have your mood and temper been recently?"
    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Oh, I've definitely been more irritable. Small things can set me off, and I find myself snapping at people more often. Sometimes I feel frustrated just because I'm tired or overwhelmed."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Thank you. Now, sleeping less than usual, but still having a lot of energy. Have you experienced nights where you sleep fewer hours but don't feel tired?"
    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Yes, definitely. During my manic episodes, I sleep very little\u2014like three or four hours\u2014and I feel surprisingly energized, like I could run a marathon."

    },

      "content": "Not exactly panic attacks, but I do sometimes feel very frightened during my anxious moments, like I can't breathe or everything's closing in."

      "content": "Understood. Do you find yourself avoiding situations that make you anxious?"
    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Yes, I tend to avoid crowded places or situations where I might feel out of control or judged. It's like I'd rather stay home than deal with the stress."

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Definitely. Sometimes I sleep a lot, like 12 hours, but still feel exhausted. Other times, I can't sleep at all during my manic episodes, and it messes with me."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",

These episodes are interwoven with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>worthlessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which suggest ongoing depressive symptoms.

Substance use, including episodic alcohol consumption and occasional tobacco use, as well as some use of sleep aids without medical guidance, are additional factors to consider. Overall, your symptoms indicate a mood disorder with both manic/hypomanic and depressive features, along with comorbid anxiety, and some behavioral health risks that warrant careful attention and treatment planning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> behaviors\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in risky activities suggest <med>hypomanic episodes</med>.

The history of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014particularly episodic heavy drinking and occasional use of sleep aids\u2014raises concerns about potential substance-related issues impacting mood and behavior. The episodic nature of mood symptoms, with clear mood swings and the absence of full-blown psychotic features, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of <med>mania</med>, <med>depression</med>, and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, as well as substance use patterns.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychoeducation, and psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage mood swings, anxiety, and substance use.  \n3. Address substance use behaviors through psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and referrals to specialized substance use treatment if needed.  \n4. Monitor for risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, especially during depressive episodes, and establish safety planning.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep patterns, stress management, and social support to improve overall functioning and stability.",

Concurrently, they describe pervasive feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and anhedonia, indicative of depressive symptoms. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of ongoing worry, tension, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension. The patient also notes occasional thoughts of self-harm during low periods but denies current suicidal intent. Dissociative experiences are minimal but include episodes of feeling detached during mood swings. Substance use patterns include episodic alcohol consumption in large quantities and occasional tobacco use, with some non-prescribed intake of sleep aids. Cognitive concerns include difficulty with concentration and memory during stressful times. The patient's symptom profile suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder with comorbid anxiety features, and there are risk factors related to self-harm thoughts and substance use. Clinical considerations should include mood stabilization, assessment of suicidality, and evaluation of substance use impact.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating mood states, with periods of elevated energy and impulsivity that include decreased sleep, risky behaviors, and feelings of confidence during high phases. These episodes are interwoven with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>worthlessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which suggest ongoing depressive symptoms. You also experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, characterized by worry, tension, avoidance, and somatic complaints like headaches and muscle aches. While you have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> during your low periods, you do not currently have active suicidal intent. Substance use, including episodic alcohol consumption and occasional tobacco use, as well as some use of sleep aids without medical guidance, are additional factors to consider. Overall, your symptoms indicate a mood disorder with both manic/hypomanic and depressive features, along with comorbid anxiety, and some behavioral health risks that warrant careful attention and treatment planning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> behaviors\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in risky activities suggest <med>hypomanic episodes</med>. These are accompanied by persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, such as worry, tension, avoidance, and somatic complaints, supports a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The history of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014particularly episodic heavy drinking and occasional use of sleep aids\u2014raises concerns about potential substance-related issues impacting mood and behavior. The episodic nature of mood symptoms, with clear mood swings and the absence of full-blown psychotic features, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment of <med>mania</med>, <med>depression</med>, and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, as well as substance use patterns.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychoeducation, and psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage mood swings, anxiety, and substance use.  \n3. Address substance use behaviors through psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and referrals to specialized substance use treatment if needed.  \n4. Monitor for risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, especially during depressive episodes, and establish safety planning.  \n5. Encourage regular sleep patterns, stress management, and social support to improve overall functioning and stability.",
