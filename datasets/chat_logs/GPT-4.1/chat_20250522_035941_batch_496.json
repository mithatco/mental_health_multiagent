This is a brief questionnaire designed to help us understand your current mental health. The purpose is to identify areas where you might be experiencing difficulties, so we can plan appropriate support or treatment if needed. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions covering various aspects of mental health, and I will ask you each question one at a time. You can answer honestly and feel free to elaborate on your experiences. Are you ready to begin?"

They report disrupted sleep patterns characterized by difficulty maintaining restful sleep, alongside feelings of restlessness and elevated energy levels despite poor sleep. Cognitive concerns are evident, with reported impairments in concentration, memory, and spatial orientation. Intrusive thoughts and feelings of emotional detachment or dissociation are also noted. The patient exhibits social withdrawal and diminished capacity for pleasure, indicating possible social isolation.\n\nAdditionally, the patient endorses recurrent passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan, which warrants careful monitoring. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including generalized worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social contexts. Somatic complaints, such as headaches and stomachaches, are present and may relate to heightened physiological tension.\n\nPatterns of concern include persistent mood disturbance, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences, sleep disturbance, and social withdrawal. There are no reported psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or recent engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, severe anxiety with avoidance, and dissociative experiences, all of which necessitate ongoing assessment and safety planning.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture indicates significant affective and anxiety symptomatology with associated cognitive and somatic complaints, highlighting the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and a potentially multi-modal treatment approach.",

      "expected": "adjustment",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of distressing symptoms recently, including persistent feelings of <sym>sadness and hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anxiety and worry</sym>, and episodes of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. You've also reported <sym>difficulty sleeping, problems with concentration and memory,</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation or emotional detachment</sym>. Your social withdrawal and diminished enjoyment in activities, combined with <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, highlight the significant impact these symptoms are having on your daily life. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very challenging time, and your openness is a positive step toward understanding and addressing what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of intense <sym>worry, anxiety, panic-like episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> support a concurrent diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>feeling detached, outside of oneself, and having difficulty with concentration and memory</sym> suggest dissociative experiences, which may be indicative of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> related to emotional overwhelm. The absence of psychotic features, current substance misuse, or active suicidal plans suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder spectrum.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, rule out medical conditions contributing to symptoms, and assess suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate a pharmacological treatment plan, possibly including antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, tailored to the patient's specific needs.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress-reduction techniques to improve sleep quality and emotional regulation.  \n5. Provide safety planning and ongoing monitoring for passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, ensuring immediate support if symptoms worsen.",
