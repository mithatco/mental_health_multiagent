Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a broad understanding of your current mental health state. This is a confidential and safe space where you can be open about your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and you can tell me how you've been feeling in your own words. Are you ready for us to begin?"

The report of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> without active plan indicates a risk that requires safety monitoring. These symptoms collectively point toward a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms, but further assessment would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and safety assessment to evaluate current risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish safety plans.  \n2. Initiate or optimize psychological intervention, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacological treatment to address mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical consultation for sleep disturbances.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support.  \n6.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports pervasive depressive symptoms characterized by anhedonia (diminished interest in activities), persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and social withdrawal. They describe significant anxiety symptoms, including heightened worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance of social situations and crowded environments. Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of insomnia, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns include increased forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments, suggestive of possible cognitive impairment or dissociative experiences. The patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches that lack clear medical explanation.\n\nNotably, there are indications of mood dysregulation, including irritability and anger outbursts, alongside occasional feelings of detachment or depersonalization. The patient admits to passive suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\") without current intent or plan, which warrants close monitoring. No current hallucinations or delusional thoughts are reported. Substance use appears minimal and within moderate limits, with no recent use of tobacco or excessive alcohol consumption.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The combination of depressive affect, anhedonia, and social withdrawal suggests a probable mood disorder, potentially major depressive disorder.\n- Anxious features, including generalized worry, panic-like sensations, and avoidance behaviors, indicate comorbid anxiety symptoms.\n- Cognitive and dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self or surroundings) may reflect underlying dissociative symptoms or severe emotional distress.\n- The presence of passive suicidal ideation underscores the need for safety assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, though without active plans, present a significant risk requiring ongoing evaluation.\n- Feelings of hopelessness, social withdrawal, and anhedonia are risk factors for worsening mood and suicidality.\n- Anxiety symptoms may contribute to functional impairment and exacerbate mood symptoms.\n\n**Clinical Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a constellation of depressive and anxious symptomatology, with notable cognitive and somatic complaints. The presentation suggests a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, accompanied by dissociative experiences and passive suicidal ideation. These findings necessitate careful risk assessment, safety planning, and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to inform targeted intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and overwhelming experience, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to face these feelings and symptoms. It sounds like you've been experiencing persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with significant <sym>anxiety</sym> that includes worries, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance of social situations. You've also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>cognitive changes</sym> such as forgetfulness and disorientation, as well as somatic symptoms like headaches and stomachaches. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is concerning and indicates the need for careful assessment and support. I hear how distressing this has been for you, and it's important to consider these symptoms carefully to determine the best course of help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, and panic-like sensations suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. Cognitive and perceptual experiences such as <sym>detachment</sym> from self and environment, along with somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, support a picture of complex emotional distress with dissociative elements. The report of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> without active plan indicates a risk that requires safety monitoring. These symptoms collectively point toward a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms, but further assessment would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and safety assessment to evaluate current risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish safety plans.  \n2. Initiate or optimize psychological intervention, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for possible pharmacological treatment to address mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical consultation for sleep disturbances.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.",
