Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, along with reports of depressed mood, fatigue, and cognitive disturbances such as forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments. There are notable irritability and irritability-related interpersonal difficulties. The patient reports persistent anxiety, with symptoms of hyperarousal, including feeling on edge and experiencing recurrent panic attacks characterized by autonomic hyperactivity and fear of losing control. Avoidance behaviors, particularly of crowded and public settings, suggest agoraphobic tendencies linked to panic symptomatology.\n\nSomatic complaints\u2014headaches and muscle aches\u2014are endorsed without medical findings, and there are reports of sleep disturbance, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, with non-restorative rest. Recurrent intrusive thoughts about panic attacks and catastrophic scenarios are evident, but compulsive behaviors are absent. The patient denies dissociative symptoms and identity disturbances. Social withdrawal is prominent, with feelings of emotional disconnection and isolation from social supports.\n\nSuicidal ideation is reported in the context of feelings of hopelessness and overwhelm, though no intent or plan is indicated. Substance use appears minimal, with no current alcohol or tobacco use, and no recent misuse of medications or illicit substances.\n\nPatterns of concern include mood disturbance with depressive features, high anxiety with panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, cognitive impairments, and social withdrawal. Risk factors include suicidal thoughts and panic disorder features, coupled with functional impairment from anxiety and mood symptoms.\n\nOverall, clinical impressions suggest a diagnosis consistent with Major Depressive Disorder comorbid with Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia. The patient's presentation warrants comprehensive assessment and treatment planning focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety evaluation regarding suicidality.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a number of challenging and distressing experiences over the past two weeks. It sounds like you've been feeling <sym>persistent sadness and hopelessness</sym>, which has affected your ability to enjoy activities you once found satisfying. You've also described <sym>irritability and increased frustration</sym>, along with <sym>trouble sleeping, headaches, and muscle aches</sym> that seem to have no clear medical cause. Your feelings of <sym>being on edge, experiencing panic attacks, and avoiding certain situations</sym> suggest significant anxiety, particularly related to panic disorder and agoraphobic tendencies. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>intrusive thoughts about panic and worst-case scenarios</sym>, and some <sym>cognitive difficulties like forgetfulness and disorientation</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed <sym>feelings of worthlessness and dark thoughts</sym> related to hopelessness, and you also report <sym>social withdrawal and feelings of emotional disconnection</sym>. Overall, your symptoms are affecting your mood, anxiety levels, sleep, physical health, and social life, and your mention of <sym>thoughts of hurting yourself</sym> indicates the importance of safety and supportive intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent, with anxious distress</med> and <med>Panic Disorder with agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and cognitive impairments</sym> aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>persistent anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance of public spaces</sym> are indicative of <med>Panic Disorder</med> with agoraphobic features. The physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and muscle aches</sym> without medical explanation, combined with sleep disturbances, support an anxious-depressive picture. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal</sym> further corroborates this impression. While somatic symptoms are prominent, they seem secondary to mood and anxiety pathology rather than a primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> underscores the need for safety assessment and urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate risk of self-harm and provide immediate support if needed.  \n2. Initiate a collaborative treatment plan that may include <med>pharmacotherapy</med> such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) and anti-anxiety medications, alongside <sym>psychotherapy</sym> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) focusing on mood regulation and panic management.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and further assessment of anxiety and mood symptoms.  \n4. Develop a safety plan and provide resources for crisis support, including contact information for mental health crisis lines.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for cognitive symptoms and physical health to rule out medical causes and tailor treatment accordingly.",
