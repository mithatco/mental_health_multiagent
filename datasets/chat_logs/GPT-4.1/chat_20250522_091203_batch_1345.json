This is a tool to help understand your current mental health symptoms across various areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions that address different aspects of your emotional and mental well-being. I'll be asking these questions one at a time, and I encourage you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You also notice <sym>irritability</sym> and social withdrawal, pulling away from friends and family. Sleep patterns have been irregular, involving both <sym>oversleeping</sym> and trouble sleeping, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired and sluggish</sym> during the day. You worry frequently about various aspects of your life, sometimes feeling <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>. You experience physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and report feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself or your surroundings</sym> at times. While you do not have thoughts of self-harm or hearing voices, your sense of being lost and uncertain about what you want suggests a profound sense of confusion and emotional distress. Overall, your symptoms indicate a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns, which have led to significant functional impairment and emotional suffering.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Overlap</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>persistent low mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, fatigue, and concentration difficulties further support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, evidenced by pervasive worry, episodic panic, and avoidance behaviors, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features. The physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches, along with the sense of disconnection, may indicate an overlap with <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, especially given the patient's reports of somatic complaints and feelings of being misunderstood. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal ideation, or substance misuse reduces the immediate risk but warrants ongoing monitoring. The overall presentation aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and somatic symptom considerations, but further assessment may clarify the extent of somatic symptom involvement.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, alongside psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n4. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, including suicidal ideation or increased anxiety, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Explore social support networks and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning, if appropriate.  \n6. If somatic symptoms persist or worsen, consider referral to a medical specialist for further evaluation.",

Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by both hypersomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). Cognitive and concentration difficulties are reported (Q16), alongside somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches (Q10). The patient exhibits significant anxiety features, including pervasive worry (Q7), episodic panic symptoms (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggestive of comorbid anxiety pathology. Experiences of dissociation (Q19) are noted but are transient.\n\nPatterns indicate a pattern of mood dysregulation, anhedonia, and social isolation, alongside anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints. The patient denies psychotic symptoms, self-harm ideation, substance misuse, or compulsive behaviors, which reduces immediate risk factors for psychosis or suicidality. However, feelings of being lost and disconnected from self and others (Q20, Q21) warrant ongoing assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with anxious features, possible somatic symptom overlap, and transient dissociative experiences. No immediate risk factors such as active suicidal ideation or self-harm are identified at this time, but the severity of mood symptoms and social withdrawal necessitate close monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex presentation of mood and anxiety symptoms with functional impairment, requiring comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning.",

However, it notably omits direct assessment of mania, psychosis, personality functioning, and repetitive thoughts/behaviors. While some follow-up questions are appropriate, key domains like mania and psychosis are absent, limiting comprehensive coverage and depth.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions largely align with DSM-5 criteria, with appropriate clinical language such as 'feeling down,' 'feeling anxious,' or 'unexplained aches.' The therapist's phrasing is generally precise and relevant. Minor issues include slight vagueness in some questions (e.g., 'feeling disconnected'), but overall, the questions effectively target core symptoms without significant inaccuracies.",
        "consistency": "The conversation maintains a logical flow, with each question following from previous responses. The therapist systematically explores symptoms related to each domain and follows up on concerning disclosures, such as anxiety and sleep issues. Some minor transitions could be smoother, but overall, the dialogue appears coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, with features of Anxious Distress and Somatic Symptom Overlap, is supported by multiple reported symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, anxiety, physical complaints, social withdrawal). However, the justification lacks explicit linkage to specific DSM-5 criteria, such as duration, severity, or ruling out other conditions like bipolar disorder or psychosis. The reasoning is generally plausible but not fully detailed or comprehensive, limiting diagnostic transparency.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional tone, providing reassurance and validating the patient's experiences. However, the responses are somewhat formal and lack overt empathetic statements or reflections that deepen rapport. There are no explicit empathetic affirmations or personalized responses to the patient's disclosures, making the interaction feel somewhat clinical and less warm than ideal."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a solid foundation in symptom exploration, covering most DSM-5 domains with appropriate clinical phrasing and generally maintaining a logical flow. However, it misses assessment of critical domains such as mania, psychosis, and personality functioning, which are important for differential diagnosis and comprehensive understanding. The diagnostic justification is adequate but lacks explicit DSM-5 criteria linkage, reducing clarity. Empathy is present but could be enhanced through more personalized and validating responses.

      "predicted": "You have shared that you're experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You feel <sym>persistent low mood and hopelessness</sym>, with a diminished interest in activities you once enjoyed, leading to feelings of numbness and disconnection. You also notice <sym>irritability</sym> and social withdrawal, pulling away from friends and family. Sleep patterns have been irregular, involving both <sym>oversleeping</sym> and trouble sleeping, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired and sluggish</sym> during the day. You worry frequently about various aspects of your life, sometimes feeling <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>. You experience physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and report feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself or your surroundings</sym> at times. While you do not have thoughts of self-harm or hearing voices, your sense of being lost and uncertain about what you want suggests a profound sense of confusion and emotional distress. Overall, your symptoms indicate a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, and somatic concerns, which have led to significant functional impairment and emotional suffering.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Overlap</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>persistent low mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, fatigue, and concentration difficulties further support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms, evidenced by pervasive worry, episodic panic, and avoidance behaviors, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features. The physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches, along with the sense of disconnection, may indicate an overlap with <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, especially given the patient's reports of somatic complaints and feelings of being misunderstood. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal ideation, or substance misuse reduces the immediate risk but warrants ongoing monitoring. The overall presentation aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and somatic symptom considerations, but further assessment may clarify the extent of somatic symptom involvement.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity.  \n2. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, alongside psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  \n3. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacological or behavioral interventions.  \n4. Monitor for any worsening symptoms, including suicidal ideation or increased anxiety, and establish a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Explore social support networks and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning, if appropriate.  \n6. If somatic symptoms persist or worsen, consider referral to a medical specialist for further evaluation.",
