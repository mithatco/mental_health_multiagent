This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that your responses are confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various aspects such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly.

Key concerns include pervasive depressive symptoms characterized by anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, tearfulness, and an overall sense of emotional numbness. There are notable cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness and disorientation, alongside sleep disturbances marked by insomnia and non-restorative sleep. The patient reports heightened anxiety, including worry, restlessness, and episodic panic attacks, coupled with avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal and situational avoidance, suggestive of social anxiety or generalized anxiety features.\n\nAdditionally, the patient describes episodes of dissociation, such as feeling detached from self and environment, and reports intrusive, recurring distressing thoughts. Physical symptoms include unexplained headaches and stomachaches, which may be stress-related. There is acknowledgment of suicidal ideation, albeit with no specific plans or intent, which constitutes a significant risk factor requiring close monitoring.\n\nPatterns reveal co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with the presence of dissociative experiences and cognitive concerns. Substance use appears minimal and within social or prescribed boundaries, reducing immediate concerns about substance misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and dissociative phenomena. The expressed suicidal thoughts and recent mood decline warrant urgent attention, alongside assessment of safety and risk management. Further exploration of the patient's functional impairment, support system, and potential trauma history is recommended to inform a comprehensive treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional distress, physical discomfort, and cognitive challenges that have been affecting your daily life. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed by persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>sadness</sym>, and <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. Your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of social situations suggest significant distress that impacts your functioning. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, along with intrusive, <sym>unwanted thoughts</sym>, indicate a complex mental health picture. The physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> may be stress-related, and your mention of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> highlights a need for careful assessment of safety. Overall, your experiences reflect a profound struggle with mood, anxiety, and possibly dissociative symptoms, and your openness about these feelings is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, tearfulness, and feeling disconnected from self and environment, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors align with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling outside of oneself, along with intrusive <sym>distressing thoughts</sym>, suggest dissociative phenomena that can co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders. The physical symptoms and thoughts of <quote>dark thoughts</quote> indicate a significant level of distress and risk that warrants close monitoring. While somatic complaints are present, they appear to be primarily stress-related rather than indicative of primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The overall clinical picture supports a diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders with dissociative features, with attention needed for safety due to suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and plan, ensuring safety and developing a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust a treatment plan involving <med>psychotherapy</med> such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for potential <med>medication</med> management, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to help alleviate mood and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Explore stress reduction techniques and coping strategies, including mindfulness or grounding exercises, to manage dissociative and anxiety symptoms.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, safety, and treatment response, and consider referral to a specialist if symptoms persist or worsen.",
