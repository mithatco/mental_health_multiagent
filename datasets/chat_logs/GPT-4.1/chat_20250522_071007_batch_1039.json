You also mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and a heavy weight that you carry most days. Alongside these, you've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, feeling restless with <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym> and frequent awakenings that leave you tired. You\u2019ve expressed significant <sym>worry</sym> about having panic attacks, along with episodes of <sym>feeling frightened or like you might lose control</sym>. Avoidance of crowded places and social situations has become necessary for you because of these fears. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about <quote>worst-case scenarios</quote> and sometimes feel <sym>detached or outside of yourself</sym>. You also mentioned thoughts of <quote>hurting yourself</quote> when overwhelmed, which is concerning. Physical symptoms like headaches and chest tightness are also present, though they seem to be related to your anxiety. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, accompanied by safety concerns that need careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder (possibly Panic Disorder)</med> and <med>Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the last two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks or intense fear episodes</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The recurring <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and <sym>sense of detachment</sym> may be related to high internal distress, possibly linked to trauma or heightened anxiety. The patient's report of <quote>thoughts of hurting themselves</quote> indicates a risk that warrants safety evaluation. The sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and emotional dysregulation support this provisional diagnosis, which integrates mood and anxiety features with safety concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med> such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and safety planning.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs) to address mood and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication adjustments.  \n5. Monitor for and provide support around dissociative symptoms and intrusive thoughts, potentially involving trauma-informed approaches if trauma history is identified.  \n6. Encourage regular follow-up to assess symptom progression, safety, and treatment effectiveness.",

Somatic complaints and dissociative experiences are also reported, indicating heightened internal distress. The presence of suicidal thoughts underscores the importance of immediate safety assessment. Sleep disturbances and intrusive thoughts further complicate the clinical picture. Overall, the patient demonstrates significant mood and anxiety symptoms with associated risk factors that warrant comprehensive evaluation, targeted intervention, and safety planning.",

The presence of panic attack symptoms aligns with the expected profile of panic. While the primary diagnosis is Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid anxiety, the mention of panic-related symptoms indicates the inclusion of panic features.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which leaves you feeling numb and disconnected. You also mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and a heavy weight that you carry most days. Alongside these, you've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, feeling restless with <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym> and frequent awakenings that leave you tired. You\u2019ve expressed significant <sym>worry</sym> about having panic attacks, along with episodes of <sym>feeling frightened or like you might lose control</sym>. Avoidance of crowded places and social situations has become necessary for you because of these fears. Additionally, you've experienced <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about <quote>worst-case scenarios</quote> and sometimes feel <sym>detached or outside of yourself</sym>. You also mentioned thoughts of <quote>hurting yourself</quote> when overwhelmed, which is concerning. Physical symptoms like headaches and chest tightness are also present, though they seem to be related to your anxiety. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, accompanied by safety concerns that need careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder (possibly Panic Disorder)</med> and <med>Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the last two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks or intense fear episodes</sym>, and avoidance behavior suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The recurring <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and <sym>sense of detachment</sym> may be related to high internal distress, possibly linked to trauma or heightened anxiety. The patient's report of <quote>thoughts of hurting themselves</quote> indicates a risk that warrants safety evaluation. The sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and emotional dysregulation support this provisional diagnosis, which integrates mood and anxiety features with safety concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and establish a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med> such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and safety planning.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs) to address mood and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep difficulties through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication adjustments.  \n5. Monitor for and provide support around dissociative symptoms and intrusive thoughts, potentially involving trauma-informed approaches if trauma history is identified.  \n6. Encourage regular follow-up to assess symptom progression, safety, and treatment effectiveness.",
