Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I'll ask each question one at a time and you can answer in your own words.

Occasionally, you notice feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> during depressive phases. These symptoms suggest significant mood instability, with episodes of <med>mania/hypomania</med> and depression, coupled with anxiety and somatic concerns, impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being.

The report of <sym>disconnection from self and environment</sym> and transient <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive states further supports this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints are common comorbidities in bipolar spectrum disorders, and the patient's history of impulsivity and risky behaviors warrants careful monitoring for potential risk management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis and assess the severity and duration of mood episodes.  \n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan, including mood stabilizers or other appropriate pharmacotherapy, alongside psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).  \n3. Monitor for risk factors, especially related to <sym>self-harm</sym> and impulsivity, and establish safety plans as needed.  \n4. Address comorbid symptoms, including anxiety and somatic complaints, with targeted interventions and medical evaluation if appropriate.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> to help you understand your symptoms and develop coping strategies.",

The patient reports episodic depressive symptoms with associated fatigue and cognitive difficulties, including forgetfulness and disconnection from self and environment. Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, evidenced by heightened worry, social avoidance, and somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension.\n\nPatterns observed include fluctuating mood states with periods of elevated energy and activity interspersed with depressive phases, along with irritability and emotional lability. The patient exhibits some psychotic-like features, notably feelings of being watched or heard thoughts, though auditory hallucinations have not been reported.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance involve mood disorder features consistent with bipolar spectrum pathology, notably hypomanic or manic episodes, alongside depressive episodes. Anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints may warrant further assessment for comorbid anxiety or somatic symptom disorder. The patient's history of impulsive behaviors and recent risky actions, coupled with reports of passive suicidal ideation without active plans, highlight the need for ongoing risk evaluation.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include recent impulsivity, risky spending, and transient thoughts of self-harm. Although no active suicidal intent is disclosed, the presence of dark thoughts during depressive episodes warrants careful monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient's responses suggest bipolar disorder with mixed features, characterized by mood instability, impulsivity, and concurrent anxiety symptoms. Further assessment is recommended to clarify diagnosis, evaluate risk, and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating moods, with episodes of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>forgetfulness</sym>, as well as periods of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. You also experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, with worries about losing control, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>. Occasionally, you notice feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, along with thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> during depressive phases. These symptoms suggest significant mood instability, with episodes of <med>mania/hypomania</med> and depression, coupled with anxiety and somatic concerns, impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences, and I understand how challenging it can be to navigate these shifts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder with mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of episodic <sym>elevated mood</sym> with decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, risky behaviors, and feelings of <quote>being super energized, like I could do anything</quote> aligns with <med>hypomanic or manic episodes</med>. Simultaneously, the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless, losing interest in activities, and hopelessness</quote>, along with episodes of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>mood swings</sym>, suggest bipolar disorder with <sym>mixed features</sym>. The report of <sym>disconnection from self and environment</sym> and transient <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive states further supports this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms and somatic complaints are common comorbidities in bipolar spectrum disorders, and the patient's history of impulsivity and risky behaviors warrants careful monitoring for potential risk management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis and assess the severity and duration of mood episodes.  \n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan, including mood stabilizers or other appropriate pharmacotherapy, alongside psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).  \n3. Monitor for risk factors, especially related to <sym>self-harm</sym> and impulsivity, and establish safety plans as needed.  \n4. Address comorbid symptoms, including anxiety and somatic complaints, with targeted interventions and medical evaluation if appropriate.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> to help you understand your symptoms and develop coping strategies.",
