At times, you've felt <sym>irritable or easily annoyed</sym> and have noticed social withdrawal and difficulty concentrating. On the other hand, you've also described episodes during which you sleep very little, feel <sym>energized</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> like impulsive spending and starting many projects. These episodes are characterized by increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and impulsivity, which sometimes lead to risky actions and a sense of being <sym>disconnected</sym> or <sym>dissociated</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>worried</sym>, especially during mood swings, and some fleeting <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Overall, you seem to experience significant mood variability that impacts your thoughts, behaviors, and relationships, along with some concerns about substance use and dissociative feelings during overwhelm.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (including features of bipolar I and/or bipolar II)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct **depressive episodes** with symptoms like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, along with episodes characterized by <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>increased activity</sym>, impulsivity, and elevated energy, suggest the presence of <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The episodic nature of mood swings, with clear distinctions between depressive and hypomanic or manic states, aligns with bipolar spectrum pathology. The transient dissociation during overwhelm and impulsive behaviors during high phases further support this diagnosis. While anxiety and some avoidant behaviors are present, they appear secondary to the mood episodes rather than primary disorders. The overall pattern indicates mood dysregulation involving both lows and highs, consistent with <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity, duration, and frequency of mood episodes, and evaluate for suicidality and substance use.\n2. Initiate psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and develop a safety plan addressing impulsivity and self-harm thoughts.\n3. Consider pharmacologic treatment, such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and develop coping strategies.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and functional impact, adjusting treatment as needed.",

Key depressive symptoms include anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, increased irritability, social withdrawal, and fatigue, with episodic hypersomnia and cognitive difficulties. Manic/hypomanic features are evidenced by decreased need for sleep (as low as 3-4 hours), increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity (impulsive spending, risky behaviors), elevated energy levels, and racing thoughts. The patient reports episodes of heightened irritability and mood instability, with some disconnection from self and surroundings during overwhelm, suggestive of transient dissociative experiences.\n\nPattern analysis reveals episodic mood fluctuations with mood congruent symptoms\u2014depressive episodes marked by low interest, hopelessness, and fatigue; hypomanic episodes characterized by decreased sleep, increased activity, and impulsivity. Anxiety symptoms are present but less prominent, with reports of situational anxiety and avoidant behaviors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Bipolar disorder, given the history of mood swings with both depressive and elevated phases.\n- Risk of impulsive behaviors and risky spending during manic episodes.\n- Suicidal ideation appears limited to fleeting thoughts during depressive states; however, ongoing assessment for suicidality is warranted.\n- Substance use (occasional alcohol and tobacco, non-prescribed medication use) may influence mood stability and warrants further exploration.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Mood instability with potential for escalation of impulsivity or risky behaviors.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and fleeting suicidality, necessitating close monitoring.\n- Occasional dissociative experiences during periods of overwhelm.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a pattern consistent with bipolar spectrum disorder, with episodic depressive and hypomanic symptoms, mood dysregulation, impulsivity, and transient dissociation. Continued assessment and diagnostic clarification are recommended, focusing on mood episode frequency, severity, and functional impact, alongside evaluation of suicidality and substance use.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of fluctuating moods and behaviors over the past two weeks. You\u2019ve described experiencing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. At times, you've felt <sym>irritable or easily annoyed</sym> and have noticed social withdrawal and difficulty concentrating. On the other hand, you've also described episodes during which you sleep very little, feel <sym>energized</sym> and <sym>risky behaviors</sym> like impulsive spending and starting many projects. These episodes are characterized by increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and impulsivity, which sometimes lead to risky actions and a sense of being <sym>disconnected</sym> or <sym>dissociated</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>worried</sym>, especially during mood swings, and some fleeting <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Overall, you seem to experience significant mood variability that impacts your thoughts, behaviors, and relationships, along with some concerns about substance use and dissociative feelings during overwhelm.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (including features of bipolar I and/or bipolar II)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct **depressive episodes** with symptoms like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, along with episodes characterized by <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>increased activity</sym>, impulsivity, and elevated energy, suggest the presence of <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The episodic nature of mood swings, with clear distinctions between depressive and hypomanic or manic states, aligns with bipolar spectrum pathology. The transient dissociation during overwhelm and impulsive behaviors during high phases further support this diagnosis. While anxiety and some avoidant behaviors are present, they appear secondary to the mood episodes rather than primary disorders. The overall pattern indicates mood dysregulation involving both lows and highs, consistent with <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to clarify the severity, duration, and frequency of mood episodes, and evaluate for suicidality and substance use.\n2. Initiate psychoeducation about <med>bipolar disorder</med> and develop a safety plan addressing impulsivity and self-harm thoughts.\n3. Consider pharmacologic treatment, such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and develop coping strategies.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and functional impact, adjusting treatment as needed.",
