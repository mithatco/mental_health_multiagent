This assessment helps us get a broad overview of your mental health symptoms across different areas. I want to assure you that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. We'll go through 23 questions that cover various aspects like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. There's no right or wrong answers\u2014just tell me how you've been feeling over the past two weeks.

You describe persistent <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy. Sleep has been challenging, with early morning awakenings and feeling tired despite less sleep. You've also noted difficulty with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>, along with <sym>headaches</sym> and bodily aches that seem to come without clear cause. Anxiety is a significant part of your experience, with frequent worries and avoidance of social situations. You mentioned having some <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym>, but no active plans or intent, and you sometimes feel detached or like you're outside of yourself. Overall, these symptoms have caused you to withdraw from loved ones and feel unsure about your identity and direction in life.

The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, with excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms like headaches and body aches, supports a comorbid diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> warrants ongoing risk assessment but does not currently suggest active suicidal intent. The dissociative features, such as feeling detached from oneself, may reflect severity of depression and anxiety but do not meet criteria for a dissociative disorder at this time. Overall, the symptom pattern aligns with severe depression and generalized anxiety, with no evidence of psychosis or other specific conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and assess for suicide risk, ensuring safety planning if needed.\n2. Consider initiating or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address depressive and anxious symptoms.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions for sleep hygiene.\n5. Explore options for social support and engagement to reduce social withdrawal.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate treatment response and adjust plan accordingly.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of emptiness, persistent hopelessness, and difficulty experiencing pleasure, suggestive of major depressive symptoms. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep, alongside reported cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and concentration problems. The patient reports anergia and low energy levels, aligning with depressive affect.\n\nAnxious symptomatology is evident through reports of pervasive worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal and reduced engagement in activities and outside interactions, which may serve as maladaptive coping strategies. Somatic complaints, including headaches and bodily aches without clear medical etiology, may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress or heightened tension.\n\nThe patient discloses passive thoughts of death without active suicidal plans; however, the presence of such ideation warrants careful monitoring. No current psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, or paranoid ideation are reported. Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol misuse or tobacco use.\n\nNotably, the patient reports feelings of depersonalization or derealization, alongside a sense of identity confusion and emotional detachment from others, which may suggest dissociative features or severe emotional blunting.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible dissociative symptoms. The patient's affective and cognitive symptoms, coupled with passive death ideation, necessitate ongoing risk assessment and consideration of intervention strategies. The patient's social withdrawal and anhedonia pose concerns for functional impairment.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe depressive symptoms with comorbid anxiety features and dissociative experiences, alongside sleep and cognitive disturbances, requiring comprehensive clinical evaluation and close monitoring for potential risk factors, including passive suicidal ideation.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical sensations over the past two weeks. You describe persistent <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy. Sleep has been challenging, with early morning awakenings and feeling tired despite less sleep. You've also noted difficulty with <sym>memory</sym> and <sym>concentration</sym>, along with <sym>headaches</sym> and bodily aches that seem to come without clear cause. Anxiety is a significant part of your experience, with frequent worries and avoidance of social situations. You mentioned having some <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym>, but no active plans or intent, and you sometimes feel detached or like you're outside of yourself. Overall, these symptoms have caused you to withdraw from loved ones and feel unsure about your identity and direction in life. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in facing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, without psychotic features</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant sleep disturbance, all indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, with excessive worry, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms like headaches and body aches, supports a comorbid diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>passive death thoughts</sym> warrants ongoing risk assessment but does not currently suggest active suicidal intent. The dissociative features, such as feeling detached from oneself, may reflect severity of depression and anxiety but do not meet criteria for a dissociative disorder at this time. Overall, the symptom pattern aligns with severe depression and generalized anxiety, with no evidence of psychosis or other specific conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and assess for suicide risk, ensuring safety planning if needed.\n2. Consider initiating or adjusting pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medication, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy, to address depressive and anxious symptoms.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions for sleep hygiene.\n5. Explore options for social support and engagement to reduce social withdrawal.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate treatment response and adjust plan accordingly.",
