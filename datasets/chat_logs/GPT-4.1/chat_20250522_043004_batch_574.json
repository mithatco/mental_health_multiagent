This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you.

You've also described trouble with <sym>sleep</sym>, physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and intrusive thoughts that are distressing. The fact that you're having <sym>thoughts of hurting yourself</sym> is very serious, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and that help is available. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to support you through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe with Anxious Distress and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest an <med>anxious distress</med> component. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> indicates some dissociative features, but these do not define a separate dissociative disorder at this point. The report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates increased risk, warranting urgent attention. Sleep disturbances, physical complaints, and cognitive issues further support the severity of the depressive episode. No psychotic symptoms are reported, and substance use appears minimal. Overall, the symptoms align most closely with a severe depressive episode with comorbid anxiety features and active suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct an immediate safety assessment to evaluate the risk of self-harm and develop a safety plan.\n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider appropriate pharmacologic treatment, such as antidepressants, and consider psychotherapy options like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).\n3. Address sleep disturbances and physical symptoms through medical evaluation and supportive interventions.\n4. Explore the patient's social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning.\n5. Monitor closely for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, and establish regular follow-up appointments.",

Key presenting concerns include pervasive anhedonia (Q2), feelings of hopelessness (Q3), irritability and irritability (Q4), and ongoing sleep disturbances characterized by hypersomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). The patient also describes intrusive thoughts and feelings of emotional numbness, detachment, and identity confusion (Q17, Q19, Q20), which suggest dissociative tendencies.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by persistent worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches (Q7-Q10). There are also reports of social withdrawal and diminished engagement with relationships (Q21). The patient endorses passive suicidal thoughts with some frequency (Q12), which constitutes a significant clinical risk factor requiring immediate attention.\n\nNotably, the patient denies psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions (Q13, Q14). Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol or tobacco use reported (Q22, Q23), and no history of medication misuse (Q24).\n\n**Patterns and Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Mood disturbance characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional numbness.\n- Anxiety symptoms including worry, panic, and avoidance.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity-related concerns.\n- Sleep disturbances and physical somatic complaints.\n- Passive suicidal ideation.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Presence of suicidal thoughts, albeit passive, warrants urgent assessment and safety planning.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and detachment pose risks for worsening mood and functioning.\n- Anxiety and dissociative symptoms could impact safety and daily functioning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode, characterized by pervasive low mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness, compounded by significant anxiety, dissociative features, and active suicidal ideation. The clinical picture necessitates a comprehensive risk assessment, safety planning, and exploration of potential diagnoses including major depressive disorder with anxious features, and possibly dissociative or trauma-related components. Immediate safety evaluation and intervention are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about how you've been feeling recently, and I want to acknowledge that it sounds like you're going through a very difficult time. You mentioned experiencing persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>, as well as significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>. You've also described trouble with <sym>sleep</sym>, physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, and intrusive thoughts that are distressing. The fact that you're having <sym>thoughts of hurting yourself</sym> is very serious, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and that help is available. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to support you through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe with Anxious Distress and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest an <med>anxious distress</med> component. The report of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> indicates some dissociative features, but these do not define a separate dissociative disorder at this point. The report of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicates increased risk, warranting urgent attention. Sleep disturbances, physical complaints, and cognitive issues further support the severity of the depressive episode. No psychotic symptoms are reported, and substance use appears minimal. Overall, the symptoms align most closely with a severe depressive episode with comorbid anxiety features and active suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct an immediate safety assessment to evaluate the risk of self-harm and develop a safety plan.\n2. Refer the patient for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to consider appropriate pharmacologic treatment, such as antidepressants, and consider psychotherapy options like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).\n3. Address sleep disturbances and physical symptoms through medical evaluation and supportive interventions.\n4. Explore the patient's social support systems and consider involving family or close contacts in treatment planning.\n5. Monitor closely for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, and establish regular follow-up appointments.",
