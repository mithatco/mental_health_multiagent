Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering various areas like mood, anxiety, and overall functioning. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself openly. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I'll ask you to tell me honestly how much these issues have bothered you recently. Are you ready to start with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a very complex and distressing set of symptoms that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges. You described experiencing persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling numb and overwhelmed most days. Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>worthlessness</sym> seem to weigh heavily on you. You also noted increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and taking on more projects than usual, possibly as a way to cope or find stimulation. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms, and avoidance of certain situations. You mentioned experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about worst-case scenarios, as well as episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling detached or outside of yourself. Additionally, you have noticed <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness and disorientation, and ongoing <sym>physical complaints</sym>, such as headaches and tension, despite medical reassurance. Your recent increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and over-the-counter sleep aids, combined with <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, highlight the severity of your current state and the need for urgent attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med>, <med>anhedonia</med>, feelings of <med>hopelessness</med>, and <med>suicidal ideation</med> over at least two weeks strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The increased substance use\u2014alcohol, tobacco, and over-the-counter sleep aids\u2014indicates maladaptive coping, raising concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The presence of dissociative experiences, cognitive difficulties, and somatic complaints further complicate the clinical picture and may reflect underlying stress or trauma-related features, but these are not sufficient for a separate diagnosis at this stage. The patient's significant risk of harm, given the expressed suicidal thoughts, warrants urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address suicidal thoughts, including possible hospitalization if risk is high.  \n2. Referral to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and initiation of evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and medication management.  \n3. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and possible referral to addiction services.  \n4. Regular monitoring of mood, anxiety, and safety, with coordination of care among mental health, primary care, and possibly psychiatric services to optimize treatment and support recovery.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent low mood over the past two weeks, consistent with depressive symptomatology. Additionally, reports of increased irritability, agitation, and engagement in risky behaviors indicate possible irritability and impulsivity components. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by pervasive worry, panic episodes with physiological symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, sweating), and avoidance behaviors, notably to crowded or public settings, reflecting possible agoraphobic tendencies.\n\nCognitive concerns include episodic memory lapses and disorientation, which warrant further assessment. Intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts about worst-case scenarios and compulsive-like checking behaviors point to obsessive features. Experiences of dissociation, such as feeling detached from oneself or the environment, are noted, adding to the complexity of symptom presentation. The patient reports significant social withdrawal, diminished emotional connectedness, and feelings of identity confusion, indicating potential deficits in social functioning and identity consolidation.\n\nSomatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle tension, with a sense of physical tension and unalleviated pain despite medical evaluation, suggesting somatic amplification or psychosomatic components. The patient admits to recent substance use\u2014excessive alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and over-the-counter sleep aid misuse\u2014highlighting maladaptive coping strategies and potential substance-related risks.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include expressed suicidal ideation with dark thoughts about self-harm, which necessitate immediate clinical attention. The presence of panic attacks, substance misuse, social withdrawal, and dissociative episodes further underscore the need for comprehensive mental health evaluation and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation with depressive, anxiety, obsessive, dissociative, and somatic symptoms, compounded by substance misuse and suicidal ideation. These findings warrant urgent and thorough assessment to determine diagnostic formulation, safety, and appropriate intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and distressing set of symptoms that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges. You described experiencing persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling numb and overwhelmed most days. Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>worthlessness</sym> seem to weigh heavily on you. You also noted increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, along with engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and taking on more projects than usual, possibly as a way to cope or find stimulation. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>constant worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms, and avoidance of certain situations. You mentioned experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about worst-case scenarios, as well as episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, feeling detached or outside of yourself. Additionally, you have noticed <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness and disorientation, and ongoing <sym>physical complaints</sym>, such as headaches and tension, despite medical reassurance. Your recent increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and over-the-counter sleep aids, combined with <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, highlight the severity of your current state and the need for urgent attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <med>depressed mood</med>, <med>anhedonia</med>, feelings of <med>hopelessness</med>, and <med>suicidal ideation</med> over at least two weeks strongly suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The increased substance use\u2014alcohol, tobacco, and over-the-counter sleep aids\u2014indicates maladaptive coping, raising concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The presence of dissociative experiences, cognitive difficulties, and somatic complaints further complicate the clinical picture and may reflect underlying stress or trauma-related features, but these are not sufficient for a separate diagnosis at this stage. The patient's significant risk of harm, given the expressed suicidal thoughts, warrants urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address suicidal thoughts, including possible hospitalization if risk is high.  \n2. Referral to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and initiation of evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and medication management.  \n3. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and possible referral to addiction services.  \n4. Regular monitoring of mood, anxiety, and safety, with coordination of care among mental health, primary care, and possibly psychiatric services to optimize treatment and support recovery.",
