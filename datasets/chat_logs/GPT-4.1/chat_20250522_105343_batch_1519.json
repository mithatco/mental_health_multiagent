We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a brief questionnaire designed to get an overall snapshot of your mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. This helps us understand what you're experiencing and identify any areas that might need further attention. Please know that anything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment will involve me asking you 23 questions, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

Consider starting evidence-based pharmacotherapy such as an antidepressant (e.g., an SSRI) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to work on managing worry, improving mood, and addressing dissociative experiences.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of ongoing support.  \n5.

Key features include anhedonia, depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and physical manifestations such as headaches and stomachaches, suggestive of somatic symptom amplification related to stress. There are notable anxiety symptoms characterized by persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social contexts. Cognitive symptoms include concentration difficulties, memory impairment, and a sense of disconnection from self and surroundings, aligning with dissociative experiences. The patient reports social withdrawal and diminished engagement with relationships, reflecting social and emotional withdrawal. Intrusive thoughts related to stressors are present, but no compulsive behaviors or perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations were reported. \n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The constellation of depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and psychomotor changes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, concentration issues) aligns with depressive symptomatology.\n- Anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry, panic attacks, and avoidance, suggest comorbid anxiety disorder.\n- Dissociative symptoms and feelings of detachment point toward dissociative features, potentially secondary to stress or trauma.\n- The presence of passive suicidal ideation (dark thoughts) warrants careful risk assessment.\n- Physical complaints and somatic symptoms appear to be stress-related.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional withdrawal increase risk for worsening mood or suicidality.\n- Anxiety and dissociative symptoms may impair functioning and increase distress.\n- No active substance use or recent substance misuse reported, reducing immediate risk related to substance intoxication.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, dissociative experiences, and physical manifestations of stress. The presence of passive suicidal ideation necessitates vigilant monitoring. The clinical picture suggests a mood and anxiety disorder with dissociative features, requiring comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and trauma-informed care as indicated.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a wide range of difficult feelings and physical symptoms over the past couple of weeks. It sounds like you've been feeling <sym>depressed</sym>, <sym>hopeless</sym>, and <sym>lost</sym> about your identity and your future. You've also been dealing with intense <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic</sym> episodes and a persistent worry about what might happen. Your physical symptoms, such as headaches, stomachaches, and sleep disturbances, seem to be closely linked to your emotional stress. Additionally, you've described feeling <sym>dissociated</sym> at times, as if you're observing yourself from outside. You're withdrawing from loved ones and feeling disconnected from your usual sources of joy, which is understandably very distressing. Your thoughts about <quote>maybe it would be easier if I just didn't exist anymore</quote> highlight the seriousness of your current state and the importance of support and care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and dissociative features, along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n\n**Reasoning:** The symptoms you described\u2014persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>\u2014are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Your report of ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors aligns with a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The experiences of <sym>detachment</sym> and feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from yourself and your surroundings suggest dissociative features, which can sometimes accompany both mood and anxiety disorders, especially in response to stress. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are a serious concern and require careful monitoring. Overall, the presentation reflects a complex mood and anxiety picture with dissociative symptoms, warranting a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough safety assessment regarding suicidality and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based pharmacotherapy such as an antidepressant (e.g., an SSRI) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to work on managing worry, improving mood, and addressing dissociative experiences.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing the importance of ongoing support.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and any escalation of suicidality or self-harm risk.",
