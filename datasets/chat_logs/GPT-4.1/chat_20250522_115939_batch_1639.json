Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool designed to assess various aspects of mental health. This assessment will help us identify any areas where you might be experiencing difficulties so we can consider the best next steps for support. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The process involves me asking you 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks, and I'd like you to answer each one honestly and as openly as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

Your sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, leaving you feeling exhausted despite sleeping more. You also described physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, along with intrusive thoughts that trouble you. Feelings of emotional numbness or detachment, along with questioning your identity and feeling disconnected from others, suggest dissociative experiences. Importantly, you acknowledged having dark thoughts about self-harm, which is concerning and requires immediate attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex clinical picture involving depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, all contributing to your distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, recurrent, with anxious distress and associated features</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and pervasive <sym>worry</sym> along with panic attacks suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>being outside oneself</sym>, indicates dissociative features that often co-occur with severe depression and anxiety. The <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight a high risk that necessitates urgent intervention. Somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are likely somatic manifestations of psychological distress. The overall symptomatology aligns with a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum requiring immediate and comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and explore the need for safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and processing traumatic or dissociative experiences.  \n4. Consider a referral to a psychiatrist or mental health specialist for further assessment and medication management.  \n5. Encourage the patient to develop a safety plan, including identifying support persons and emergency contacts, given the suicidal thoughts.  \n6. Explore additional support for sleep hygiene and stress management techniques.",

Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by increased sleep duration coupled with non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15). Intrusive and ruminative thoughts, coupled with feelings of emotional numbness or derealization (Q19), suggest dissociative experiences or depersonalization phenomena. Evidence of heightened anxiety is evident through reports of persistent worry (Q7), panic attacks (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9). The patient also reports somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches (Q10), which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nNotably, the patient endorses thoughts of self-harm (Q12), which, although stated as non-acting, represent a significant clinical risk factor requiring immediate attention. The presence of dark thoughts and feelings of being dismissed or misunderstood (Q11) further underscores emotional distress. Cognitive concerns are present with reports of forgetfulness and disorientation (Q16). While substance use appears minimal, the patient's social withdrawal and anhedonia merit further exploration.\n\nPatterns in responses suggest moderate to severe depression co-occurring with generalized anxiety disorder features, panic symptoms, and dissociative experiences. The combination of mood symptoms, somatic complaints, and suicidal ideation signifies a high clinical priority. Overall, the presentation warrants urgent comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been feeling overwhelmed, sad, and hopeless most days, with a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. You mentioned experiencing increased irritability, frequent worry, and panic attacks, which indicate significant anxiety. Your sleep has been disrupted, with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, leaving you feeling exhausted despite sleeping more. You also described physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, along with intrusive thoughts that trouble you. Feelings of emotional numbness or detachment, along with questioning your identity and feeling disconnected from others, suggest dissociative experiences. Importantly, you acknowledged having dark thoughts about self-harm, which is concerning and requires immediate attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex clinical picture involving depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, all contributing to your distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, recurrent, with anxious distress and associated features</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and pervasive <sym>worry</sym> along with panic attacks suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>being outside oneself</sym>, indicates dissociative features that often co-occur with severe depression and anxiety. The <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight a high risk that necessitates urgent intervention. Somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> are likely somatic manifestations of psychological distress. The overall symptomatology aligns with a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum requiring immediate and comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the risk of self-harm and explore the need for safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and processing traumatic or dissociative experiences.  \n4. Consider a referral to a psychiatrist or mental health specialist for further assessment and medication management.  \n5. Encourage the patient to develop a safety plan, including identifying support persons and emergency contacts, given the suicidal thoughts.  \n6. Explore additional support for sleep hygiene and stress management techniques.",
