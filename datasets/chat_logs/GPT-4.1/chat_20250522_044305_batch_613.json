Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a set of questions designed to get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment helps identify areas that might need further attention or support. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions today, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

Your sleep issues, including <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and <sym>waking frequently during the night</sym>, contribute to feelings of exhaustion. You also experience <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, which makes you feel disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and you\u2019ve noted problems with <sym>memory</sym> and intrusive <sym>distressing thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> when overwhelmed or lonely, though not with active intent to harm yourself. Your avoidance of social situations and fears of judgment indicate social anxiety, and your physical complaints, like headaches and stomach aches, seem related to ongoing stress. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation with mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, significantly impacting your daily functioning and sense of well-being. \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) with features of depression, anxiety, and dissociation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports include persistent low mood, anhedonia, irritability, sleep disturbance, cognitive difficulties, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of detachment, all of which are consistent with a <med>depressive disorder</med> spectrum. The prominence of social anxiety, avoidance, panic attacks, and feelings of being on edge suggest significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. The dissociative experiences of feeling disconnected from oneself and the environment point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful risk assessment but does not currently indicate active intent or plan. No psychotic features are reported, and the variety of symptoms across mood, anxiety, and dissociation supports a diagnosis of a complex mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features, rather than a single categorical diagnosis like <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. This assessment emphasizes a broad, dimensional understanding of your experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to explore the history, severity, and duration of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed approaches) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacologic treatment, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the intensity of symptoms and impact on functioning.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and develop coping strategies to manage stress and intrusive thoughts.  \n5. Establish safety planning and regular monitoring of suicidal ideation, ensuring immediate support if symptoms worsen or risk increases.",

Reports of irritability, sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep with increased restlessness, and cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness suggest significant functional impairment. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of social anxiety, avoidance of social situations, panic attacks in social contexts, and a subjective experience of feeling on edge. Intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment (derealization or depersonalization) further complicate the clinical picture, alongside reports of physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, which may be stress-related.\n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without active intent, primarily during periods of emotional overwhelm, which constitutes a notable risk factor. No evidence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or delusions) is reported. There is a pattern of social withdrawal, feelings of disconnection, and identity confusion, indicating potential issues with self-concept and relational functioning.\n\nClinically significant areas include mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive disturbances, somatic complaints, and risk assessment for self-harm. The presentation warrants comprehensive evaluation for mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and dissociative symptoms, with attention to suicidality and safety planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of distressing symptoms that reflect significant emotional and cognitive challenges. You\u2019ve described persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Your sleep issues, including <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and <sym>waking frequently during the night</sym>, contribute to feelings of exhaustion. You also experience <sym>derealization or depersonalization</sym>, which makes you feel disconnected from yourself and your surroundings, and you\u2019ve noted problems with <sym>memory</sym> and intrusive <sym>distressing thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> when overwhelmed or lonely, though not with active intent to harm yourself. Your avoidance of social situations and fears of judgment indicate social anxiety, and your physical complaints, like headaches and stomach aches, seem related to ongoing stress. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex presentation with mood, anxiety, and dissociative features, significantly impacting your daily functioning and sense of well-being. \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) with features of depression, anxiety, and dissociation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports include persistent low mood, anhedonia, irritability, sleep disturbance, cognitive difficulties, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of detachment, all of which are consistent with a <med>depressive disorder</med> spectrum. The prominence of social anxiety, avoidance, panic attacks, and feelings of being on edge suggest significant <med>anxiety symptoms</med>. The dissociative experiences of feeling disconnected from oneself and the environment point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful risk assessment but does not currently indicate active intent or plan. No psychotic features are reported, and the variety of symptoms across mood, anxiety, and dissociation supports a diagnosis of a complex mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and dissociative features, rather than a single categorical diagnosis like <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. This assessment emphasizes a broad, dimensional understanding of your experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to explore the history, severity, and duration of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed approaches) to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacologic treatment, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the intensity of symptoms and impact on functioning.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, and develop coping strategies to manage stress and intrusive thoughts.  \n5. Establish safety planning and regular monitoring of suicidal ideation, ensuring immediate support if symptoms worsen or risk increases.",
