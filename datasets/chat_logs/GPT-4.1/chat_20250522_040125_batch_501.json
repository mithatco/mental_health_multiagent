The prominent social fears, avoidance behaviors, and panic episodes in social contexts are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of emotional detachment, identity concerns, and ruminative negative thoughts further support this dual presentation. The absence of suicidal ideation or psychosis suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than a psychotic or trauma-related disorder. This clinical picture indicates co-occurring depressive and social anxiety symptoms, which may significantly impair social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify symptom severity, duration, and functional impact, and to confirm the diagnoses.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, if symptoms are severe, persistent, or impairing, and in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral strategies to improve sleep hygiene; evaluate for underlying medical issues if sleep problems persist.\n5. Explore social skills training or exposure-based interventions to gradually reduce social avoidance and anxiety.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders to the patient and involve supportive systems (e.g., family or friends) as appropriate.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to assess treatment response, adjust interventions, and monitor for any emerging risks or comorbidities.",

There is a notable presence of irritability and anger (Q4), alongside significant social anxiety manifesting as avoidance of social situations, fear of embarrassment, and panic episodes in social contexts (Q7, Q8, Q9). The patient reports feelings of emotional detachment or derealization (Q19), self-questioning and identity uncertainty (Q20), and social withdrawal (Q21), which may suggest underlying affective and social functioning disturbances.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a convergence of mood dysregulation, anxiety symptoms, and social avoidance behaviors, with recurrent ruminative thoughts focused on past embarrassments (Q17). The patient denies suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and reports no recent risky behaviors or compulsive urges.\n\nClinically significant areas include depressive symptomatology, social anxiety, sleep disturbance, cognitive concerns, and emotional detachment. Risk factors for concern include social isolation, panic episodes, and feelings of unreality, which may contribute to functional impairment. No immediate safety risks such as suicidal ideation or self-harm are evident based on current responses, but ongoing monitoring of anxiety and mood symptoms is recommended.\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests comorbid depressive and social anxiety features with underlying cognitive and emotional regulation challenges, warranting comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex pattern of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress and social difficulties. They report persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty falling and staying asleep, as well as a sense of restlessness, are evident. The patient also experiences recurrent <sym>ruminative thoughts</sym> about past embarrassments, which seem to contribute to ongoing worry and self-doubt. Socially, they exhibit marked <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, fear of <sym>embarrassment</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> triggered by social interactions. Feelings of <sym>emotional detachment or derealization</sym> and ongoing identity questioning further complicate their emotional landscape. Despite these challenges, they deny <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, but their overall functioning appears impacted by their mood and social anxiety symptoms. The combination of mood, anxiety, and social withdrawal symptoms suggests a nuanced clinical picture requiring comprehensive evaluation and tailored intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, sleep difficulties, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent social fears, avoidance behaviors, and panic episodes in social contexts are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of emotional detachment, identity concerns, and ruminative negative thoughts further support this dual presentation. The absence of suicidal ideation or psychosis suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder rather than a psychotic or trauma-related disorder. This clinical picture indicates co-occurring depressive and social anxiety symptoms, which may significantly impair social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify symptom severity, duration, and functional impact, and to confirm the diagnoses.\n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, if symptoms are severe, persistent, or impairing, and in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral strategies to improve sleep hygiene; evaluate for underlying medical issues if sleep problems persist.\n5. Explore social skills training or exposure-based interventions to gradually reduce social avoidance and anxiety.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders to the patient and involve supportive systems (e.g., family or friends) as appropriate.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to assess treatment response, adjust interventions, and monitor for any emerging risks or comorbidities.",
