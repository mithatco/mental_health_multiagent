You mentioned feeling <sym>sad most days</sym> and sometimes overwhelmed by these feelings, which has impacted your ability to enjoy life and connect with others. Your reports include <sym>increased irritability</sym> and <sym>feeling anxious and worried</sym> about many aspects of your life, accompanied by episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are frightening. Sleep issues, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep, waking in the middle of the night, and feeling tired despite sleeping</sym>, are prominent. You also noted <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>trouble concentrating</sym>, along with physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>. Additionally, you shared experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself</sym>. Importantly, you admitted to <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, which is concerning and requires urgent attention.

The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors points to comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>concentration difficulties</sym>, and physical symptoms reinforce the severity of mood and anxiety symptoms. The report of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> of <sym>self-harm</sym> indicates a risk that warrants immediate safety assessment. The symptom pattern aligns with depressive and anxiety disorders, with features that suggest a complex, comorbid presentation requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, tailored to the patient's symptom profile.\n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and possible medication management if warranted.\n5. Consider a multidisciplinary approach involving primary care, psychiatry, and psychotherapy to address physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms.\n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairments further complicate the clinical picture. Somatic complaints and emotional detachment suggest high psychological distress. The active suicidal thoughts necessitate immediate safety planning and possibly further psychiatric evaluation.

The presentation includes pervasive depressive symptoms, significant anxiety, panic episodes, cognitive and somatic complaints, and suicidal ideation, which are more characteristic of major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety, not adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorders typically involve less severe, situation-related distress and impairment, which is not emphasized here.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a range of intense and distressing symptoms. You feel <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>lack interest in activities</sym>, often describing a sense of emotional <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You mentioned feeling <sym>sad most days</sym> and sometimes overwhelmed by these feelings, which has impacted your ability to enjoy life and connect with others. Your reports include <sym>increased irritability</sym> and <sym>feeling anxious and worried</sym> about many aspects of your life, accompanied by episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that are frightening. Sleep issues, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep, waking in the middle of the night, and feeling tired despite sleeping</sym>, are prominent. You also noted <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>trouble concentrating</sym>, along with physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>. Additionally, you shared experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself</sym>. Importantly, you admitted to <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, which is concerning and requires urgent attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, and somatic complaints, all contributing to significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med> and <med>Panic Attacks</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest and pleasure</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors points to comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>concentration difficulties</sym>, and physical symptoms reinforce the severity of mood and anxiety symptoms. The report of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> of <sym>self-harm</sym> indicates a risk that warrants immediate safety assessment. The symptom pattern aligns with depressive and anxiety disorders, with features that suggest a complex, comorbid presentation requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, considering antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs, tailored to the patient's symptom profile.\n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and possible medication management if warranted.\n5. Consider a multidisciplinary approach involving primary care, psychiatry, and psychotherapy to address physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms.\n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
