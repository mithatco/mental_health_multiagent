We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to better understand your current mental health symptoms. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences openly. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions across various areas of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer honestly, and there's no right or wrong way to respond. If you're ready, I'd like to start with the first question: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and exposure and response prevention for compulsive behaviors.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and possibly sleep-focused interventions or referrals if needed.  \n5.

There is evidence of increased irritability and agitation, alongside sleep disturbances marked by early awakening and difficulty maintaining sleep, which contribute to fatigue. The patient reports cognitive difficulties, including forgetfulness and memory issues, as well as somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches, suggestive of somatic symptomatology often associated with depression.\n\nAnxiety features are notable, with reports of pervasive worry, physical tension, panic episodes, and behavioral avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, indicating comorbid anxiety symptoms, possibly generalized anxiety disorder or panic episodes. Intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors like repeated hand washing and checking, point toward obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Experiences of dissociation (\"feeling outside oneself\" or \"in a fog\") and identity confusion suggest possible dissociative features or depersonalization.\n\nThe patient reports feelings of emotional detachment and social withdrawal, indicating possible social or interpersonal impairment. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs was reported. Substance use appears minimal, with no current risky alcohol or tobacco use, and no recent misuse of medications or drugs.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive self-harm ideation (\"wishing to disappear\" or \"stop the pain\") without active plans or intent, which warrants careful monitoring. The presence of hopelessness, anhedonia, and passive self-harm thoughts are clinically significant and necessitate ongoing assessment for suicidality.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture is characterized by severe depressive and anxiety symptoms with compulsive and dissociative features, alongside somatic complaints and interpersonal difficulties. These findings suggest a complex presentation requiring a comprehensive treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociative experiences.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of difficult and distressing experiences, including persistent <sym>feelings of low mood, hopelessness, and anhedonia</sym>. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as early awakening and difficulty staying asleep. You described <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors like repeated <sym>hand washing and checking</sym>. You also reported feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, which can be very unsettling. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms have impacted your relationships and overall sense of well-being. You\u2019ve shown great honesty and bravery in sharing these struggles, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge how challenging this has been for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (possibly generalized anxiety disorder and panic episodes), <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>, and <med>Dissociative Features</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The pervasive <sym>low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep issues</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety, worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive, distressing <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym> like repeated washing and checking, indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. The feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> point toward <med>Dissociative Features</med>. While somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches are present, they seem to be linked to psychological stress rather than a primary somatic disorder. The passive <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> warrant careful monitoring but do not currently indicate active suicidal intent.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess risk, especially regarding passive self-harm thoughts.  \n2. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to address depressive, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and exposure and response prevention for compulsive behaviors.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and possibly sleep-focused interventions or referrals if needed.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in passive self-harm thoughts and ensure safety planning.  \n6. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and consider trauma-informed therapy if appropriate.",
