This questionnaire helps us understand various mental health domains and how they might be affecting you. Please know that everything you share is private and confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I will ask you each question one by one, and you can answer based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depression, including pervasive feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and persistent low mood over the past two weeks. Anxiety symptoms are also significant, characterized by persistent worry, restlessness, irritability, and panic-like episodes, particularly in social and crowded settings. Sleep disturbances are notable, with difficulty initiating and maintaining restful sleep, alongside subjective experiences of racing thoughts and heightened arousal states. The patient reports cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and feelings of derealization or depersonalization, suggestive of dissociative experiences often associated with heightened anxiety or mood disturbance.\n\nRepetitive intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors indicate possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The patient's impulsivity is evidenced by engagement in risky behaviors and increased project initiation. Somatic symptoms, including frequent headaches, muscle tension, and stomach discomfort, align with somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression.\n\nSubstance use behaviors include daily cigarette smoking and episodic excessive alcohol consumption, which may serve as maladaptive coping strategies. Although current psychotic symptoms are absent, the patient endorses passive suicidal ideation, with occasional fleeting thoughts of self-harm, which warrants careful assessment for suicide risk.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment.\n- Presence of dissociative and obsessive-compulsive features.\n- Somatic complaints correlated with emotional distress.\n- Substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism.\n- Passive suicidal ideation with no active plans or intent reported but necessitating ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, although not elaborated as active ideation, indicate vulnerability.\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors increase risk for adverse outcomes.\n- Substance use may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- Feelings of emotional disconnection and withdrawal suggest social isolation.\n\n**Overall Observation:**\nThe patient's presentation indicates a complex affective disorder with prominent depressive and anxiety features, accompanied by dissociative phenomena and compulsive behaviors. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and substance use underscores the need for vigilant risk assessment and integrated treatment planning. Further evaluation should include a detailed risk assessment and consideration of comorbidities to inform targeted interventions.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed most of the DSM-5 Level 1 domains, including mood, anger, anxiety, sleep, suicidality, psychosis, somatic symptoms, memory, repetitive thoughts and dissociation, as well as substance use. However, some domains such as personality functioning and obsessive-compulsive traits were only briefly mentioned in the diagnostic summary rather than thoroughly explored with targeted questions. The conversation lacked specific follow-up questions in certain areas like obsessive-compulsive behaviors and detailed personality assessment, which are important for a comprehensive evaluation.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Questions largely reflected DSM-5 criteria and were relevant to the symptoms described by the patient. The phrasing was generally appropriate, with clear clinical language. Minor improvements could be made in ensuring some questions directly mirror DSM-5 terminology, particularly around obsessive-compulsive traits, which were only inferred rather than explicitly assessed. Overall, questions were appropriate for clinical assessment but had some room for more precise DSM-5 alignment.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question following naturally from the patient's responses. The therapist maintained a coherent structure, covering domains systematically. There were no major abrupt topic shifts; follow-up questions were appropriate. Minor issues include slight missed opportunities to probe deeper into some symptoms, but these did not significantly disrupt the flow.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with GAD and obsessive-compulsive features aligns with the patient's reported symptoms. The reasoning was generally sound, citing core symptoms like hopelessness, low mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms. However, the justification was somewhat superficial regarding obsessive-compulsive traits, which were only briefly mentioned in the summary without detailed symptom linkage. The assessment did not thoroughly differentiate or explore other potential diagnoses such as bipolar disorder or trauma-related conditions, limiting its robustness.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy through validating the patient's feelings and creating a safe space. The tone was professional and supportive, and the therapist acknowledged the difficulty of the patient's experiences. Nonetheless, there was minimal explicit emotional validation or warmth beyond standard professionalism. Slightly more personalized responses could enhance the sense of understanding and connection."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation effectively covers most DSM-5 symptom domains relevant to the patient's presentation, with questions appropriately aligned to clinical criteria. The flow of the dialogue is coherent and logical, and the therapist exhibits professionalism and empathy. However, the assessment falls short of comprehensive coverage in certain areas such as obsessive-compulsive traits and personality functioning, and the diagnostic justification, while generally sound, lacks depth in linking specific symptoms to the DSM-5 criteria. The critique emphasizes the need for more thorough exploration of some symptom domains and more explicit diagnostic reasoning to meet the highest standards of clinical rigor. Overall, this is a strong performance with room for improvement in depth and specificity.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing experience characterized by persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>low mood</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that seem to overwhelm your daily life. You mentioned difficulty finding pleasure in activities you once enjoyed and feelings of disconnection from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your worries and physical symptoms, like headaches and muscle tension, appear to be significantly affecting your sleep, concentration, and overall sense of well-being. It\u2019s understandable that these challenges feel overwhelming, and reaching out for assessment shows strength and a desire for support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and features of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Traits</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks, which align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent worry, restlessness, irritability, and episodes of panic suggest significant <sym>generalized anxiety symptoms</sym>. Physical manifestations such as muscle tension, headaches, and sleep disturbances support this diagnosis. Additionally, intrusive thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors point to obsessive-compulsive tendencies, which may be secondary or co-occurring. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are concerning and indicate a need for risk assessment, though no active plans or intent are reported. Substance use, including smoking and episodic alcohol consumption, may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms but are not primary diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for suicidality and implement safety planning as needed.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties, after a psychiatric evaluation.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical consultation.  \n5. Encourage reduction of substance use, particularly smoking and alcohol intake, and explore healthier coping strategies.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
