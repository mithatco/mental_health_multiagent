          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant emotional distress, primarily characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, and anxiety symptoms. They report feeling down and experiencing a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, alongside pervasive feelings of nervousness and episodes of panic. These symptoms are compounded by sleep disturbances, including difficulty maintaining sleep and overall sleep disruption, which may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\nThe patient exhibits avoidance behaviors related to anxiety, particularly avoiding crowded places and public transportation out of fear of panic attacks, and has withdrawn socially, indicating social isolation. They acknowledge experiencing unexplained aches and pains, alongside feelings of being misunderstood regarding their health concerns, which may reflect somatic preoccupations associated with anxiety or somatic symptom disorder.\n\nThought content is notable for the presence of distressing, intrusive thoughts, but there is no current evidence of self-harm ideation, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations or delusions), or compulsive behaviors. The absence of substance use or medication misuse is noted.\n\nClinically significant patterns include comorbid depressive symptoms and anxiety, with evidence of avoidance and social withdrawal, which could impact functioning. The patient's concern about being dismissed by healthcare providers and somatic complaints warrant further exploration.\n\nPotential risk factors or warning signs include the patient's social withdrawal and panic episodes, although there are no current indications of suicidal ideation or intent. The chronicity of sleep issues and avoidance behaviors may contribute to or maintain their psychological distress.\n\nOverall, the patient demonstrates moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptomatology with associated somatic complaints and social isolation, necessitating a comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention to address these interconnected issues.",
