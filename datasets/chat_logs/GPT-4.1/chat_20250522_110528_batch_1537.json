Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get an overall picture of your mental health across different areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. The assessment will involve me asking you 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. You can answer honestly and openly, and if you're uncomfortable with any question, just let me know. Are you ready to begin?"

I want to assure you that your feelings are valid, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major depressive disorder</med> with <med>comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med> and <med>brief psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, indicating <med>major depressive disorder</med>.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with pervasive symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, anxiety, trauma-related phenomena, and substance misuse. Elevated levels of anhedonia, hopelessness, and feelings of disconnection suggest major depressive features, compounded by reports of sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including persistent worry, physiological arousal (e.g., chest tightness, racing heart), panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, notably avoiding driving and situations that trigger trauma memories. Intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and dissociative experiences point toward post-traumatic stress symptoms. The patient reports auditory hallucinations (hearing whispers) and paranoid ideation (belief that others can read thoughts), raising concern for psychotic features. Somatic complaints, such as headaches and back pain linked to stress, are present, alongside feelings of emotional numbness and social withdrawal, indicating possible symptoms of depersonalization/derealization and social isolation.\n\nSubstance use appears maladaptive, with increased alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and non-prescribed medication intake, likely serving as self-medication for emotional distress and sleep difficulties. The presence of suicidal ideation\u2014specifically thoughts of self-harm\u2014is a notable safety concern requiring immediate attention.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring mood, anxiety, trauma-related, and psychotic symptoms suggest complex comorbidity.\n- Emotional blunting, dissociation, and social withdrawal indicate significant functional impairment.\n- Substance use is maladaptive, potentially exacerbating psychiatric symptoms.\n- Risk factors include active suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, psychotic-like experiences, and substance misuse.\n\n**Warning Signs and Risk Factors:**\n- Suicidal ideation with thoughts of self-harm\n- Psychotic features (auditory hallucinations, paranoid thoughts)\n- Trauma-related symptoms (flashbacks, avoidance, hyperarousal)\n- Substance misuse as a form of self-medication\n- Dissociative experiences and feelings of unreality\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex clinical picture characterized by major depressive disorder features, persistent anxiety and trauma symptoms, dissociative phenomena, psychotic-like experiences, and substance use for self-medication. The presence of suicidal ideation necessitates urgent safety assessment and intervention. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is recommended to address mood, trauma, psychosis, and substance use components, with careful monitoring for potential escalation of risk.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and distressing experience, and I want to acknowledge the immense courage it takes to be open about these feelings and symptoms. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with a combination of intense <sym>depressive</sym> feelings, including <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym>, along with pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and traumatic memories related to a past event. You\u2019re also experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings, and even <sym>hallucinations</sym> such as hearing whispers. Your reports of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, <sym>substance misuse</sym>, and social withdrawal raise significant concern about your overall safety and well-being. I want to assure you that your feelings are valid, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major depressive disorder</med> with <med>comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med> and <med>brief psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, indicating <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The trauma-related symptoms, including <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, hyperarousal, and dissociative experiences, support a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing whispers), paranoid thoughts about being able to read minds, and feelings of unreality suggest <med>brief psychotic features</med> that often occur in the context of severe mood or trauma-related disorders. The active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> further underscore the severity and immediacy of risk, requiring urgent intervention. The combination of these symptoms indicates a complex presentation that involves multiple overlapping diagnoses, with significant impairment and risk factors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment immediately, including risk of <sym>suicide</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>. Develop a safety plan and consider hospitalization if necessary.  \n2. Initiate an integrated treatment plan that includes <med>psychiatric medication management</med>\u2014such as antidepressants or antipsychotics\u2014tailored to address mood, trauma, and psychotic symptoms.  \n3. Provide <med>trauma-focused psychotherapy</med>, like cognitive processing therapy or EMDR, to address PTSD symptoms and trauma memories.  \n4. Incorporate <med>substance use interventions</med> to reduce maladaptive drinking, tobacco use, and medication misuse, including referral to addiction specialists if needed.  \n5. Offer <med>supportive therapy</med> aimed at improving social connection, emotional regulation, and coping skills.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and medication effects, and adjust treatment as needed.",
