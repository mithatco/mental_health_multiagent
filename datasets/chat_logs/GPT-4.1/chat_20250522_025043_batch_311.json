You mention feeling <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, with thoughts that things may not improve, and you also feel <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>. You\u2019ve noticed changes in your sleep, sometimes sleeping very little during episodes of higher energy, but lately sleeping excessively and still feeling exhausted. You describe engaging in impulsive behaviors like making risky purchases and starting new projects during elevated moods, alongside persistent worries and <sym>anxiety</sym>. You also mention occasional <sym>panic</sym> feelings, avoidance of social situations, trouble with <sym>memory</sym>, and intrusive negative thoughts. There are times you feel disconnected or distant from yourself and others, and you\u2019ve admitted to having <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Overall, your experiences reflect significant mood swings, episodes of heightened energy and impulsivity, as well as depressive symptoms, coupled with anxiety and cognitive difficulties. Your distress and these symptoms suggest a complex mood disorder with both depressive and hypomanic features, and some anxiety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and depressive symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> over two weeks indicates a significant depressive episode. Concurrently, episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, impulsivity, engaging in risky activities, and <sym>mood swings</sym> align with hypomanic episodes consistent with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature of mood changes (without full-blown mania) further support this diagnosis. The mixture of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, along with anxiety symptoms, points toward a bipolar spectrum disorder rather than unipolar depression or other mood conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Seek comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, including possible medication management such as mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants.\n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety.\n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan, including crisis resources if thoughts of self-harm intensify.\n4. Consider psychoeducation about mood stabilization, triggers, and lifestyle modifications to support ongoing management.\n5. Coordinate care with a mental health professional to regularly assess mood symptoms, medication adherence, and overall functioning.",

They also describe episodes consistent with mood swings, including periods of elevated energy, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep, and engagement in risky behaviors, suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes. Anxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of persistent worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors. Cognitive concerns include concentration difficulties and memory impairment. The patient endorses recurrent intrusive negative thoughts and occasional suicidal ideation without active plans, highlighting potential self-harm risk.\n\nNotable patterns include fluctuations between depressive and elevated states, with corresponding changes in sleep patterns, activity levels, and impulsivity. The absence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions is noted. Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol or tobacco use reported, and no non-prescribed medication misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass mood instability (suggestive of bipolar spectrum features), comorbid anxiety, depressive symptoms, cognitive disturbances, and passive suicidal ideation. Risk factors include recent hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and impulsive behaviors during hypomanic episodes. Absence of psychosis and substance misuse are positive factors but warrant ongoing monitoring.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with a mood disorder with bipolar features, accompanied by comorbid anxiety and cognitive impairment, necessitating comprehensive assessment and formulation for targeted intervention.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly references Bipolar II Disorder, highlighting the presence of depressive symptoms alongside hypomanic episodes characterized by elevated energy, impulsivity, and mood swings. The reasoning clearly aligns with the typical features of bipolar spectrum disorders, specifically bipolar II, which involves episodes of depression and hypomania without full mania. The mention of mood swings, impulsivity, and episodic mood changes confirms the diagnosis's alignment with the bipolar profile.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and behaviors. You mention feeling <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym>, with thoughts that things may not improve, and you also feel <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>. You\u2019ve noticed changes in your sleep, sometimes sleeping very little during episodes of higher energy, but lately sleeping excessively and still feeling exhausted. You describe engaging in impulsive behaviors like making risky purchases and starting new projects during elevated moods, alongside persistent worries and <sym>anxiety</sym>. You also mention occasional <sym>panic</sym> feelings, avoidance of social situations, trouble with <sym>memory</sym>, and intrusive negative thoughts. There are times you feel disconnected or distant from yourself and others, and you\u2019ve admitted to having <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Overall, your experiences reflect significant mood swings, episodes of heightened energy and impulsivity, as well as depressive symptoms, coupled with anxiety and cognitive difficulties. Your distress and these symptoms suggest a complex mood disorder with both depressive and hypomanic features, and some anxiety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and depressive symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> over two weeks indicates a significant depressive episode. Concurrently, episodes of <sym>elevated energy</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, impulsivity, engaging in risky activities, and <sym>mood swings</sym> align with hypomanic episodes consistent with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, avoidance behaviors, and intrusive thoughts support a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature of mood changes (without full-blown mania) further support this diagnosis. The mixture of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, along with anxiety symptoms, points toward a bipolar spectrum disorder rather than unipolar depression or other mood conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Seek comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, including possible medication management such as mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants.\n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to develop coping skills, address negative thought patterns, and manage anxiety.\n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan, including crisis resources if thoughts of self-harm intensify.\n4. Consider psychoeducation about mood stabilization, triggers, and lifestyle modifications to support ongoing management.\n5. Coordinate care with a mental health professional to regularly assess mood symptoms, medication adherence, and overall functioning.",
