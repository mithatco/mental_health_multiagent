The questionnaire includes 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time and encourage you to answer openly and naturally. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You described persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and <sym>irregular sleep patterns</sym> that leave you feeling restless and jittery. You also experience intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, including physical sensations like a racing heart and feelings of fear. You mentioned <sym>visual and auditory hallucinations</sym>\u2014hearing whispers and noises that others do not, as well as paranoid thoughts that others may read your mind. You described feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, along with confusion about your identity and difficulty maintaining close relationships. Additionally, you reported engaging in <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, prescription medications, and marijuana, which may be contributing to or exacerbating your symptoms. Your openness about these experiences is brave, and I want to acknowledge the difficulties you are facing. It\u2019s important to recognize that your symptoms are complex and warrant careful, supportive evaluation and treatment planning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient demonstrates core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and physical complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoid ideation</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest <med>psychotic features</med> that can sometimes accompany severe depression or psychotic disorders. The history of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, compulsive checking, and identity confusion further point to a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and psychotic spectrum symptoms. Substance use may be compounding the clinical picture, but the primary features align most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features and comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Further assessment is necessary to clarify the extent of psychosis and to evaluate for other possible diagnoses such as <med>Schizophrenia</med> or trauma-related disorders, but current evidence suggests this combined diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for risk of self-harm or suicidality.  \n2. Initiate an integrated treatment plan including <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-focused therapy).  \n3. Address substance use through counseling and support services, considering referral to addiction specialists if needed.  \n4. Conduct safety assessments and establish a crisis plan to manage active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems as appropriate.",

There is evidence of irritability and increased activity levels, suggestive of possible mood dysregulation. Anxiety features are prominent, characterized by persistent worry, feelings of being on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments. The patient reports sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with early awakenings, coupled with physical complaints such as headaches and stomachaches lacking medical explanation.\n\nAdditional symptoms include cognitive and perceptual disturbances, notably auditory hallucinations (hearing whispers/noises), dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and surroundings), and paranoid ideation (belief that others can read thoughts). Intrusive, distressing thoughts about past mistakes and compulsive checking behaviors suggest underlying obsessive-compulsive features. There are also indications of identity confusion and social withdrawal, with feelings of disconnection from relationships.\n\nSubstance use appears problematic, with recent increased alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and use of prescription medication and marijuana without medical oversight, indicating potential substance misuse or dependency.\n\nNotable risk factors and warning signs include:\n- Passive suicidal ideation without explicit plans.\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation.\n- Substance misuse involving prescription drugs and illegal substances.\n- Feelings of dissociation and identity confusion.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a complex presentation with co-occurring mood, anxiety, psychotic, dissociative, and substance use symptoms. The presence of psychotic-like experiences, suicidal thoughts, and substance misuse warrants comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and a safety assessment to determine the appropriate level of intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a distressing and complex set of experiences that reflect significant mental health challenges. You described persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and <sym>irregular sleep patterns</sym> that leave you feeling restless and jittery. You also experience intense <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, including physical sensations like a racing heart and feelings of fear. You mentioned <sym>visual and auditory hallucinations</sym>\u2014hearing whispers and noises that others do not, as well as paranoid thoughts that others may read your mind. You described feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, along with confusion about your identity and difficulty maintaining close relationships. Additionally, you reported engaging in <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, prescription medications, and marijuana, which may be contributing to or exacerbating your symptoms. Your openness about these experiences is brave, and I want to acknowledge the difficulties you are facing. It\u2019s important to recognize that your symptoms are complex and warrant careful, supportive evaluation and treatment planning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient demonstrates core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and physical complaints such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> support this diagnosis. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoid ideation</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest <med>psychotic features</med> that can sometimes accompany severe depression or psychotic disorders. The history of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, compulsive checking, and identity confusion further point to a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and psychotic spectrum symptoms. Substance use may be compounding the clinical picture, but the primary features align most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with psychotic features and comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Further assessment is necessary to clarify the extent of psychosis and to evaluate for other possible diagnoses such as <med>Schizophrenia</med> or trauma-related disorders, but current evidence suggests this combined diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for risk of self-harm or suicidality.  \n2. Initiate an integrated treatment plan including <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-focused therapy).  \n3. Address substance use through counseling and support services, considering referral to addiction specialists if needed.  \n4. Conduct safety assessments and establish a crisis plan to manage active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems as appropriate.",
