This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health by asking about your experiences over the past two weeks. All your responses are confidential, and this is a safe space for you to share honestly. The questionnaire has 23 questions covering different domains such as mood, anxiety, energy, and others. We'll go through each question one by one. Are you ready to begin?"

You also experience <sym>anxiety, irritability, racing thoughts, and some physical discomfort like headaches</sym>.

Your experiences of dissociation, confusion, and occasional disconnection from yourself and others further suggest a significant impact on your well-being. It's understandable that these mood swings and related symptoms have been challenging to manage, and your honesty is a vital step toward receiving appropriate support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> considerations\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports indicate recurrent episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> alongside <sym>hypomanic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated mood, increased activity, decreased sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>. The episodic nature of these mood swings, with clear periods of both lows and highs, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>, which involves at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like worry, avoidance, and physical tension suggests a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The described <sym>alcohol use</sym> during high phases may point to substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism. While some symptoms like dissociation and fleeting self-harm thoughts are noted, they do not currently indicate a psychotic disorder. The pattern of mood instability, impulsivity, and episodic symptoms support this diagnosis, though ongoing assessment is needed to confirm.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and substance use.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes mood stabilization\u2014potentially with medications such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics\u2014and psychotherapy focusing on mood regulation, coping skills, and addressing comorbid anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns, especially during depressive episodes, and assess the risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts regularly.  \n4. Consider psychoeducation about mood disorder management, substance use risks, and strategies to recognize early signs of mood shifts.  \n5. If substance use persists, refer to specialized addiction services to support reduction or abstinence.",

Reported symptoms include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness consistent with depressive episodes, alongside episodes of elevated mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, risky behaviors, and decreased impulse control suggestive of hypomanic or manic states. The patient reports heightened irritability, racing thoughts, increased activity levels, and engagement in risky behaviors during high phases, as well as social withdrawal and diminished emotional connection during lows.\n\nAdditionally, the patient experiences anxiety symptoms, including worry, irritability, and avoidance behaviors, alongside somatic complaints such as headaches and body aches, which may be stress-related. Intrusive thoughts are noted but are not associated with compulsive behaviors. There is evidence of transient dissociative symptoms, such as feelings of detachment, and cognitive issues like forgetfulness and mild disorientation, which may be linked to mood episodes or stress. Suicidal ideation appears to be limited to fleeting thoughts during depressive periods, with no indication of active intent.\n\nThe patient also reports alcohol use, with episodes of higher consumption during mood elevations, representing potential substance-related risk factors. No auditory or visual hallucinations are reported, and perceptual disturbances are absent.\n\nOverall, the responses suggest significant mood dysregulation with episodic mood episodes, risk-taking behavior, and comorbid anxiety. The pattern of symptoms warrants further assessment for bipolar disorder, comorbid anxiety, and substance use, with attention to risk factors for self-harm during depressive states.\n\nPotential clinical areas of concern include mood instability, impulsivity, suicidality risk, substance misuse, anxiety symptoms, and dissociative experiences. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess safety, and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of mood fluctuations, including periods of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless, losing interest in activities, and withdrawing socially</quote>, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and engagement in risky behaviors</sym>. You also experience <sym>anxiety, irritability, racing thoughts, and some physical discomfort like headaches</sym>. Importantly, you acknowledge <quote>fleeting thoughts of self-harm during depressive episodes</quote>, though without intent to act. Your experiences of dissociation, confusion, and occasional disconnection from yourself and others further suggest a significant impact on your well-being. It's understandable that these mood swings and related symptoms have been challenging to manage, and your honesty is a vital step toward receiving appropriate support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> considerations\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports indicate recurrent episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> alongside <sym>hypomanic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated mood, increased activity, decreased sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>. The episodic nature of these mood swings, with clear periods of both lows and highs, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>, which involves at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like worry, avoidance, and physical tension suggests a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The described <sym>alcohol use</sym> during high phases may point to substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism. While some symptoms like dissociation and fleeting self-harm thoughts are noted, they do not currently indicate a psychotic disorder. The pattern of mood instability, impulsivity, and episodic symptoms support this diagnosis, though ongoing assessment is needed to confirm.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment for <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and substance use.  \n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes mood stabilization\u2014potentially with medications such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics\u2014and psychotherapy focusing on mood regulation, coping skills, and addressing comorbid anxiety.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns, especially during depressive episodes, and assess the risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts regularly.  \n4. Consider psychoeducation about mood disorder management, substance use risks, and strategies to recognize early signs of mood shifts.  \n5. If substance use persists, refer to specialized addiction services to support reduction or abstinence.",
