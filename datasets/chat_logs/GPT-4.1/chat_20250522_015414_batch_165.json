Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different domains. Your responses will help us get a clearer picture of how you've been feeling over the past two weeks, and I want to assure you that everything you share is confidential. This process will involve going through 23 questions, one at a time. There's no right or wrong answer, and you can take your time. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You've also been dealing with significant anxiety, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance of certain situations</sym> like driving, and physical symptoms such as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and muscle tension. Your reports of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>intrusive images related to trauma</sym> suggest that trauma-related symptoms are also prominent. Additionally, your increased substance use appears to be an attempt to cope with these overwhelming feelings, which could complicate your clinical picture. Your thoughts of <sym>wondering if it would be easier to disappear</sym> indicate some risk of self-harm, even though there is no current intent or plan. I want to validate that what you're experiencing is very real and difficult, and help you find the next steps toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and trauma-related symptoms (possibly PTSD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>tearfulness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of excessive worry, physical symptoms such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>chest tightness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Intrusive <sym>images of trauma</sym>, dissociative experiences, and hyperarousal symptoms suggest trauma-related features, possibly aligning with <med>PTSD</med>. Substance use behaviors and passive suicidal thoughts further indicate the severity and complexity of the clinical presentation. The combination of mood, anxiety, trauma symptoms, and substance use indicates a multi-faceted clinical picture that warrants a comprehensive approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of suicidality and trauma history, to clarify diagnosis and safety.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), tailored to address depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), to help alleviate mood and anxiety symptoms, under close medical supervision.  \n4. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and integrated treatment planning.  \n5. Develop a safety plan and discuss options for crisis support in case of worsening mood or thoughts of self-harm.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and risk factors.",

Additionally, there are notable anxiety-related symptoms characterized by persistent worry, physiological arousal (e.g., chest tightness, racing heart), and specific phobias related to driving and crowded environments, with avoidance behaviors evident. Sleep disturbances are prominent, involving frequent awakenings, difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and associated distress.\n\nPsychotic-like features are minimal; the patient denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs but reports intrusive distressing images related to a traumatic event, suggestive of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Dissociative experiences, such as feeling outside of oneself, and feelings of emotional disconnection from self and others, are reported, pointing toward dissociative symptoms. The patient also describes cognitive concerns, including forgetfulness and confusion.\n\nSubstance use appears to serve as maladaptive coping, with increased alcohol consumption and tobacco use, alongside self-administered sleep medication and recreational marijuana, raising concerns about potential substance misuse.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (\"wondered if it would be easier if I just disappeared\") without current intent or plan, and reported self-injurious thoughts. The patient\u2019s social withdrawal, emotional numbing, and substance use further underscore clinical concern for depression and comorbid anxiety disorders, possibly complicated by trauma-related features.\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests a complex clinical picture characterized by major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety with specific phobias, trauma-related intrusive thoughts, dissociative experiences, sleep disturbance, and substance use. Continuous risk assessment and comprehensive evaluation, including screening for suicidality, trauma history, and substance misuse, are warranted to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and complex experience, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to carry these feelings and symptoms. You've described persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym/n>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>emotional numbness</sym>. You've also been dealing with significant anxiety, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance of certain situations</sym> like driving, and physical symptoms such as <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and muscle tension. Your reports of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and <sym>intrusive images related to trauma</sym> suggest that trauma-related symptoms are also prominent. Additionally, your increased substance use appears to be an attempt to cope with these overwhelming feelings, which could complicate your clinical picture. Your thoughts of <sym>wondering if it would be easier to disappear</sym> indicate some risk of self-harm, even though there is no current intent or plan. I want to validate that what you're experiencing is very real and difficult, and help you find the next steps toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and trauma-related symptoms (possibly PTSD)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>tearfulness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of excessive worry, physical symptoms such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>chest tightness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward a <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Intrusive <sym>images of trauma</sym>, dissociative experiences, and hyperarousal symptoms suggest trauma-related features, possibly aligning with <med>PTSD</med>. Substance use behaviors and passive suicidal thoughts further indicate the severity and complexity of the clinical presentation. The combination of mood, anxiety, trauma symptoms, and substance use indicates a multi-faceted clinical picture that warrants a comprehensive approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of suicidality and trauma history, to clarify diagnosis and safety.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), trauma-focused therapy, or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), tailored to address depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), to help alleviate mood and anxiety symptoms, under close medical supervision.  \n4. Address substance use concerns through motivational interviewing and integrated treatment planning.  \n5. Develop a safety plan and discuss options for crisis support in case of worsening mood or thoughts of self-harm.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and risk factors.",
