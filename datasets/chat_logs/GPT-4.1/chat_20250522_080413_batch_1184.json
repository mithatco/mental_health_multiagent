The assessment involves 23 questions across different areas of mental health, and I will ask each one in turn.

      "content": "You have shared that you experience persistent and pervasive <sym>social anxiety</sym>, feeling anxious almost every day, especially around unfamiliar people or social situations. You tend to avoid gatherings like parties or meetings because of fears of being judged or embarrassed, which can make social interactions very challenging and distressing. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, with symptoms like a racing heart and feeling faint, often triggered by social concerns. Alongside these anxiety symptoms, you report feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> at times, low interest in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulties with sleep due to ruminative thoughts about social scenarios. You also noted experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches related to stress, as well as occasional feelings of dissociation or being outside of yourself during heightened anxiety. Importantly, you do not have thoughts of self-harm or hallucinations, and you do not use substances.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features suggestive of comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (mild to moderate)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent anxiety in social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The daily and pervasive nature of these fears, along with physical symptoms like increased heart rate and nausea, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The physical complaints and sleep disturbances are consistent with anxiety and depression-related somatic symptoms. While dissociative feelings are noted, they appear to be secondary to anxiety rather than primary dissociative disorder. There is no evidence of psychosis or substance misuse, and the patient's symptoms account for significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on exposure and social skills training to address social fears and avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to reduce anxiety symptoms and improve mood.  \n3. Monitor sleep patterns and recommend sleep hygiene strategies; evaluate for any underlying medical issues that may contribute to physical symptoms.  \n4. Assess for severity of depressive symptoms and consider adding evidence-based interventions for depression if symptoms persist or worsen.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression, and explore support groups or social skills training programs as adjuncts.",

The patient reports experiencing frequent and ongoing anxiety, including panic attacks linked to social concerns, as well as difficulty sleeping attributable to ruminative thoughts about social scenarios. \n\nAdditional features include anhedonia and low mood, with feelings of hopelessness, which may suggest comorbid depressive symptoms. The presence of intrusive, recurring negative thoughts and feelings of disconnection or depersonalization are noted, along with mild cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness during anxious states. The patient denies suicidal ideation, self-harm thoughts, psychotic symptoms, or substance misuse. \n\nPattern analysis indicates high social avoidance and significant functional impairment related to anxiety and mood symptoms. There are no current indications of agitation or irritability, but chronic anxiety and social fears are evident. The patient reports physical symptoms like headaches and stomach aches, likely psychosomatic in origin, and experiences sleep difficulties tied to worry.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Social anxiety disorder with associated panic symptoms\n- Possible comorbid depressive features\n- Functional impairment due to avoidance and mood symptoms\n- Somatic complaints related to anxiety\n- No evidence of psychosis, substance misuse, or active suicidality at this time\n\n**Risk factors or warning signs:**\n- No active suicidal ideation or intent\n- No current self-harm thoughts\n- Chronic anxiety and avoidance may contribute to social isolation and worsening mood\n- No indications of psychosis or substance abuse\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient exhibits significant social anxiety with associated panic features, alongside symptoms indicative of depression, including anhedonia and hopelessness. Anxiety appears to be the primary driver of distress and functional impairment, with cognitive and somatic symptoms noted. Further assessment may be warranted to evaluate the severity of depression, functional impact, and to consider tailored interventions targeting social anxiety and comorbid mood symptoms.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience persistent and pervasive <sym>social anxiety</sym>, feeling anxious almost every day, especially around unfamiliar people or social situations. You tend to avoid gatherings like parties or meetings because of fears of being judged or embarrassed, which can make social interactions very challenging and distressing. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, with symptoms like a racing heart and feeling faint, often triggered by social concerns. Alongside these anxiety symptoms, you report feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> at times, low interest in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulties with sleep due to ruminative thoughts about social scenarios. You also noted experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches related to stress, as well as occasional feelings of dissociation or being outside of yourself during heightened anxiety. Importantly, you do not have thoughts of self-harm or hallucinations, and you do not use substances.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features suggestive of comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (mild to moderate)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent anxiety in social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The daily and pervasive nature of these fears, along with physical symptoms like increased heart rate and nausea, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The physical complaints and sleep disturbances are consistent with anxiety and depression-related somatic symptoms. While dissociative feelings are noted, they appear to be secondary to anxiety rather than primary dissociative disorder. There is no evidence of psychosis or substance misuse, and the patient's symptoms account for significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on exposure and social skills training to address social fears and avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to reduce anxiety symptoms and improve mood.  \n3. Monitor sleep patterns and recommend sleep hygiene strategies; evaluate for any underlying medical issues that may contribute to physical symptoms.  \n4. Assess for severity of depressive symptoms and consider adding evidence-based interventions for depression if symptoms persist or worsen.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression, and explore support groups or social skills training programs as adjuncts.",
