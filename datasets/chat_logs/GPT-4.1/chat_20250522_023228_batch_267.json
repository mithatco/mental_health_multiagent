Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool designed to assess different aspects of mental health across various domains. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences openly. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions about your feelings and behaviors over the past two weeks. Please answer honestly and in your own words. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling <sym>tired</sym> despite sleeping more, and trouble concentrating, which has made it hard for you to focus and remember things. You\u2019ve experienced <sym>physical discomforts</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, and have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, though not with any intent or plan. Additionally, you described feeling <sym>derealization</sym> and disconnected from yourself and others, which can be quite distressing. It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what lies ahead, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, Recurrent</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features and <med>Dissociative Symptoms>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>derealization</sym> and feelings of disconnection indicate dissociative phenomena, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety symptoms, especially under significant stress. The <sym>physical complaints</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> raise concern for increased risk, though without active planning or intent. Overall, the symptoms align with a severe depressive episode with anxious and dissociative features, necessitating a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to assess for safety and evaluate for potential suicidal risk, including immediate safety planning if needed.\n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, considering the severity and comorbid features.\n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to symptoms.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms to normalize experiences and enhance engagement in treatment.\n6. Monitor symptoms regularly and adjust treatment as necessary, including evaluating for possible hospitalization if safety concerns escalate.",

The report also highlights significant anxiety features, including pervasive worry, heightened irritability, and panic episodes, suggestive of comorbid anxiety pathology. Sleep disturbances are evident, with complaints of insomnia and non-restorative sleep despite increased sleep duration, contributing to fatigue and cognitive fog. The patient reports concentration difficulties, memory impairment, and intrusive negative thoughts, aligning with cognitive and affective dysregulation. Somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches are likely stress-related. Importantly, there are passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan, indicating elevated clinical concern for self-harm risk. Derealization experiences and feelings of identity disconnection point toward dissociative symptoms, warranting further assessment. Substance use appears limited but includes episodic alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance dependence is noted.\n\nPatterns in responses suggest a mood disorder with significant anxiety features, social withdrawal, and dissociative phenomena. The patient exhibits risk factors for suicidality, including hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts. The overall clinical picture underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention addressing mood, anxiety, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms over the past two weeks, including persistent feelings of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, and increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. You also mentioned difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, feeling <sym>tired</sym> despite sleeping more, and trouble concentrating, which has made it hard for you to focus and remember things. You\u2019ve experienced <sym>physical discomforts</sym> like headaches and stomachaches, and have had <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, though not with any intent or plan. Additionally, you described feeling <sym>derealization</sym> and disconnected from yourself and others, which can be quite distressing. It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time, feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what lies ahead, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, Recurrent</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features and <med>Dissociative Symptoms>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>derealization</sym> and feelings of disconnection indicate dissociative phenomena, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety symptoms, especially under significant stress. The <sym>physical complaints</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> raise concern for increased risk, though without active planning or intent. Overall, the symptoms align with a severe depressive episode with anxious and dissociative features, necessitating a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to assess for safety and evaluate for potential suicidal risk, including immediate safety planning if needed.\n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, considering the severity and comorbid features.\n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to symptoms.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms to normalize experiences and enhance engagement in treatment.\n6. Monitor symptoms regularly and adjust treatment as necessary, including evaluating for possible hospitalization if safety concerns escalate.",
