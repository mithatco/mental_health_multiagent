You're going through significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and ongoing <sym>fatigue</sym>. Your sleep difficulties, including waking very early and feeling exhausted despite sleep, along with cognitive issues like forgetfulness and mental fog, further affect your daily functioning. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>worried</sym>, as well as avoidance behaviors, indicates a complex picture of emotional distress. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> and images of yourself in a negative way, which are concerning signs that require attention. Your feelings of <quote>being lost</quote> and <quote>not knowing who I really am anymore</quote> highlight a profound sense of identity confusion and emotional pain. Overall, you are experiencing significant suffering that impacts many aspects of your life, and it\u2019s important to approach this with compassion and the right support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Sleep disturbance, specifically early awakening and fatigue, along with cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness and concentration difficulties, support this diagnosis. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors points to comorbid <med>anxiety</med> features. Recurrent <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> without active intent suggest a risk for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, warranting careful monitoring. The overall symptom pattern indicates moderate severity, affecting social functioning and daily life, without evidence of psychosis or substance misuse. The patient's feelings of <quote>lost identity</quote> and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis, aligning with clinical criteria for <med>major depressive disorder</med> with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including safety planning and suicide risk evaluation, given passive death thoughts.  \n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n4. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce social withdrawal.  \n5. Regular follow-up to reassess symptom severity, functional impairments, and safety, adjusting treatment as needed.",

Sleep disturbance is evident, characterized by early morning awakenings and non-restorative sleep, contributing to ongoing fatigue and concentration difficulties. The patient reports cognitive impairment, including forgetfulness and mental fog, alongside feelings of emotional detachment and social withdrawal, indicative of affective flattening and social isolation. Anxiety symptoms are also notable, with reports of persistent worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors tied to social and environmental triggers. The presence of recurrent distressing intrusive thoughts, including passive death wishes and images of self-harm, raises concern for passive suicidal ideation, although no current intent or plans are disclosed. Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and muscle tension further support the clinical picture of psychological distress manifesting physically.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a consistent co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with significant impairment in social functioning and self-perception. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse is identified. The patient\u2019s responses suggest increased emotional suffering, functional decline, and potential vulnerability to self-harm.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive death thoughts, sleep disruption, social withdrawal, and feelings of emptiness and lost identity. While active suicidal intent is not reported, the passive ideation warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by severe depressive symptoms with comorbid anxiety features, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and passive suicidal thoughts, which collectively necessitate comprehensive clinical assessment and intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot of difficult feelings and experiences with me, and I want you to know that it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and lost at times. You're going through significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and ongoing <sym>fatigue</sym>. Your sleep difficulties, including waking very early and feeling exhausted despite sleep, along with cognitive issues like forgetfulness and mental fog, further affect your daily functioning. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>worried</sym>, as well as avoidance behaviors, indicates a complex picture of emotional distress. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> and images of yourself in a negative way, which are concerning signs that require attention. Your feelings of <quote>being lost</quote> and <quote>not knowing who I really am anymore</quote> highlight a profound sense of identity confusion and emotional pain. Overall, you are experiencing significant suffering that impacts many aspects of your life, and it\u2019s important to approach this with compassion and the right support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>, consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Sleep disturbance, specifically early awakening and fatigue, along with cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness and concentration difficulties, support this diagnosis. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors points to comorbid <med>anxiety</med> features. Recurrent <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> without active intent suggest a risk for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, warranting careful monitoring. The overall symptom pattern indicates moderate severity, affecting social functioning and daily life, without evidence of psychosis or substance misuse. The patient's feelings of <quote>lost identity</quote> and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis, aligning with clinical criteria for <med>major depressive disorder</med> with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including safety planning and suicide risk evaluation, given passive death thoughts.  \n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or consultation with a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n4. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce social withdrawal.  \n5. Regular follow-up to reassess symptom severity, functional impairments, and safety, adjusting treatment as needed.",
