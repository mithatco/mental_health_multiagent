Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health domains based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. It helps us identify areas that might need further attention and ensures your concerns are fully understood. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different aspects of mental health, and I will ask them one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> more often, as well as experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>worrying constantly</sym> about many aspects of your life. Your sleep has been disturbed, with <sym>less sleep but still feeling tired</sym>, and you\u2019ve noticed difficulties with concentration and memory. You also expressed feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself and others</sym>, and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>.

The occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicate a need for safety assessment but do not suggest active suicidal intent at this time. The overlap of depressive and anxiety symptoms suggests a comorbid presentation, which is common and warrants integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate risk of self-harm, and explore the duration and severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and ensure the patient has access to crisis resources if needed.  \n3. Initiate or consider referral for evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms impair functioning.  \n5. Encourage lifestyle modifications that support mental health, including regular physical activity, sleep hygiene, and social engagement when possible.  \n6.

Anxiety is also a significant component, evidenced by chronic worry, hypervigilance, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and headaches. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by reduced sleep duration with non-restorative sleep, contributing to fatigue and impaired functioning.\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports occasional passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent, indicating a potential risk factor for self-harm, warranting ongoing assessment and safety planning. There are no indications of psychotic symptoms; the patient denies auditory or thought broadcasting phenomena.\n\nPatterns noted include overlapping depressive and anxiety symptoms, with increased irritability, emotional numbness, and feelings of detachment from self and others. The patient's social withdrawal and decreased enjoyment of relationships further compound clinical concerns. Substance use appears minimal, with no current alcohol misuse or tobacco use, and no recent misuse of medications.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include persistent hopelessness, passive suicidal thoughts, significant anxiety with panic episodes, social withdrawal, and physical complaints related to stress. These indicators suggest a need for comprehensive risk assessment, potential diagnostic evaluation for mood and anxiety disorders, and formulation of an integrated treatment plan emphasizing safety, symptom management, and functional improvement.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a lot about what you've been experiencing lately, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a very difficult time. You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> more often, as well as experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>worrying constantly</sym> about many aspects of your life. Your sleep has been disturbed, with <sym>less sleep but still feeling tired</sym>, and you\u2019ve noticed difficulties with concentration and memory. You also expressed feelings of <sym>detachment from yourself and others</sym>, and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms have impacted your daily life, and your willingness to talk openly about them is a positive step toward getting support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Disorder (possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits several core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and difficulties with concentration and memory. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>physical tension</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient reports ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms consistent with <med>Anxiety Disorder, possibly GAD</med>. The occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicate a need for safety assessment but do not suggest active suicidal intent at this time. The overlap of depressive and anxiety symptoms suggests a comorbid presentation, which is common and warrants integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate risk of self-harm, and explore the duration and severity of symptoms.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and ensure the patient has access to crisis resources if needed.  \n3. Initiate or consider referral for evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in collaboration with a psychiatrist, especially if symptoms impair functioning.  \n5. Encourage lifestyle modifications that support mental health, including regular physical activity, sleep hygiene, and social engagement when possible.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response, adjusting the plan as needed.",
