Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

The assessment involves 23 questions about your experiences over the past two weeks, and I will ask each one in turn. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014just be honest and open. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also mention increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with a constant feeling of worry about various aspects of your life. Sleep has been a significant issue, with difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative rest, which seem to contribute to your overall fatigue. Additionally, you've noted symptoms like <sym>disconnection from yourself or your surroundings</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and intrusive <sym>repetitive negative thoughts</sym>. While you have occasional thoughts of self-harm, you clarify that there's no active intent or plan. The overall picture suggests a complex emotional state involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative features, leading to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about your identity and future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, recurrent, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, especially social withdrawal, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. Cognitive complaints, such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling disconnected</sym> and <sym>watching oneself from afar</sym>, suggest additional <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> that may be associated with severe emotional distress. The sleep disturbances further exacerbate the mood and cognitive issues. Although there are no current psychotic symptoms, the dissociative experiences warrant careful consideration. The passive nature of suicidal thoughts without active intent reduces immediate risk but indicates the need for ongoing safety monitoring. Overall, the symptoms align with a moderate recurrent depressive episode with significant anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment for <med>comorbid anxiety and dissociative disorders</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan and provide psychoeducation about recognizing warning signs of active suicidality.  \n3.

There are notable symptoms of irritability, irritability, and emotional dysregulation. Anxiety-related features include persistent worry, restlessness, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with reports of insomnia, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns include memory difficulties and disorientation. Intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts and transient dissociative experiences (feeling disconnected or watching oneself from afar) are also reported. The patient admits to occasional passive thoughts of self-harm but denies active ideation or intent.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\n- Elevated mood disturbance with depressive and anxious symptomatology.\n- Symptoms of irritability and emotional reactivity are prominent.\n- Sleep difficulties and fatigue are recurrent themes.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection suggest anhedonia and emotional numbing.\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociative experiences indicate possible underlying distress or dissociative symptoms.\n- No current evidence of psychosis or substance misuse is present.\n- The patient reports no recent risky behaviors, substance use, or medication misuse.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive symptoms with comorbid anxiety features.\n- Sleep disturbance impacting daily functioning.\n- Dissociative experiences warrant further assessment.\n- Passive suicidal ideation, although without active plans or intent.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of isolation.\n- Cognitive complaints suggest possible cognitive or neuropsychiatric implications.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts necessitate ongoing monitoring.\n- Dissociative symptoms and emotional dysregulation may increase risk for worsening mental health.\n- No active self-harm behavior or intent reported; however, the presence of dark thoughts indicates vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with depressive and anxiety symptoms characterized by low mood, anhedonia, irritability, pervasive worry, sleep disturbances, and dissociative sensations. There are indications of social withdrawal and cognitive difficulties, alongside passive suicidal ideation. These findings suggest a complex mood and anxiety presentation that warrants comprehensive diagnostic assessment, safety planning, and tailored intervention strategies.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly describes a major depressive disorder with anxious and dissociative features, which are characteristic of a mood disorder rather than an adjustment disorder. The symptoms include pervasive depressed mood, hopelessness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and dissociative experiences, indicating a more severe and recurrent clinical condition. Adjustment disorder typically involves a more transient, less severe reaction to stressors, which is not reflected in this comprehensive symptom profile. Therefore, the diagnosis does not align with the expected profile of adjustment disorder.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging emotional and cognitive symptoms recently. You describe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, along with a sense of being stuck or overwhelmed by your circumstances. You also mention increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with a constant feeling of worry about various aspects of your life. Sleep has been a significant issue, with difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative rest, which seem to contribute to your overall fatigue. Additionally, you've noted symptoms like <sym>disconnection from yourself or your surroundings</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and intrusive <sym>repetitive negative thoughts</sym>. While you have occasional thoughts of self-harm, you clarify that there's no active intent or plan. The overall picture suggests a complex emotional state involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative features, leading to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about your identity and future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, recurrent, with anxious distress and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of persistent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, especially social withdrawal, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. Cognitive complaints, such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and dissociative experiences like <sym>feeling disconnected</sym> and <sym>watching oneself from afar</sym>, suggest additional <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> that may be associated with severe emotional distress. The sleep disturbances further exacerbate the mood and cognitive issues. Although there are no current psychotic symptoms, the dissociative experiences warrant careful consideration. The passive nature of suicidal thoughts without active intent reduces immediate risk but indicates the need for ongoing safety monitoring. Overall, the symptoms align with a moderate recurrent depressive episode with significant anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment for <med>comorbid anxiety and dissociative disorders</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan and provide psychoeducation about recognizing warning signs of active suicidality.  \n3. Consider starting <med>antidepressant medication</med> (such as an SSRI or SNRI), tailored to the patient's profile, in conjunction with psychotherapy.  \n4. Refer for <med>psychotherapy</med>\u2014cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)\u2014to address mood, anxiety, cognitive distortions, and dissociative symptoms.  \n5. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacological support.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
