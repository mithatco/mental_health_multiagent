Notable mood disturbances include chronic feelings of despair, irritability, and disconnection from relationships, along with reports of difficulty with sleep\u2014characterized by initial and maintenance insomnia\u2014and cognitive concerns such as memory difficulties and feelings of detachment or derealization. The patient also reports pervasive anxiety, with symptoms of excessive worry, restlessness, and physical manifestations such as muscle tension and unexplained somatic complaints (e.g., stomach discomfort). Intrusive, recurrent negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggest features of obsessive-compulsive tendencies. \n\nThere are concerning indications of active suicidal ideation, evidenced by dark thoughts and wishes to disappear, which require immediate assessment and intervention. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or disordered perceptual experiences is noted. The patient\u2019s avoidance of social situations and diminished pleasure from relationships further support a significant impact on functioning.\n\n**Patterns and Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive symptomatology with an emphasis on anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue\n- Elevated anxiety levels with specific avoidance behaviors and somatic symptoms\n- Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors indicating possible comorbid OCD features\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including dissociation and memory issues\n- Active suicidal ideation necessitating urgent safety assessment\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal thoughts and wishes to disappear\n- Significant hopelessness and feelings of being overwhelmed\n- Functional impairment related to mood and anxiety symptoms\n- Possible dissociative experiences\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, with active suicidal ideation and obsessive-compulsive features.

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing and complex set of experiences, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, difficulty <sym>sleeping</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. You also describe feeling <sym>distant</sym> from your relationships, experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> that is overwhelming at times, and having thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>. These symptoms have significantly impacted your mood, thoughts, and daily functioning, and it\u2019s understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed by everything you're experiencing. Your honesty and willingness to share these feelings are important steps toward getting the support you need.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress and Active Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and <sym>dissociation</sym> further supports this diagnosis. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>\u2014including excessive worry, avoidance, and physical sensations like racing heart\u2014indicates <med>Anxious Distress</med> component. The active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> raise concern about immediate safety, emphasizing the severity of the depression. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse was noted, and the symptoms align with a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, warranting urgent intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct an immediate <quote>safety assessment</quote> to evaluate the risk of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>suicide</sym> and establish safety precautions.\n2. Refer for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for <med>medication</med> such as antidepressants, and consider <med>psychotherapy</med> options like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.\n3. Develop a safety plan with the patient, including crisis resources, coping strategies, and support networks.\n4. Monitor symptoms closely, especially the active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and consider hospitalization if there is imminent risk.\n5. Address <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> through appropriate therapeutic interventions and possibly pharmacotherapy.\n6. Explore additional assessments for <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> to inform treatment planning.",
