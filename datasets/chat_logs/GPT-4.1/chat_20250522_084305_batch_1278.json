Your <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> have increased, and you\u2019re having difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, waking frequently and feeling exhausted. You also describe <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms like <sym>heart pounding</sym> and <sym>sweating</sym>, leading you to avoid situations that trigger these episodes.

You\u2019ve expressed <sym>self-harm ideation</sym> and engage in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope with your distress. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomach aches are also noted, and you feel that your concerns are sometimes dismissed by others. Overall, your presentation indicates significant emotional distress, anxiety, and mood difficulties, compounded by cognitive and dissociative symptoms, as well as maladaptive coping strategies.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder (likely Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms (possibly depersonalization/derealization disorder)</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder (alcohol and tobacco)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> over the past two weeks suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with somatic symptoms, ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> point toward <med>Panic Disorder</med> and possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, including <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>, supports a dissociative component, which can occur with severe anxiety or trauma-related conditions. The report of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> as maladaptive coping strategies increases the concern for safety and indicates <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. These overlapping symptoms suggest a complex clinical picture with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, dissociative features, and substance misuse, requiring integrated assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk for self-harm, and explore any trauma history.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> and substance use, possibly involving crisis resources and close monitoring.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, anxiety, and substance use, and consider trauma-informed therapy if relevant.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy to manage <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med>, potentially involving a psychiatrist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support, while encouraging gradual re-engagement with social activities.  \n6.

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of numbness, persistent hopelessness, irritability, and heightened anxiety with frequent panic episodes characterized by somatic symptoms such as palpitations and sweating. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with reduced sleep duration, fragmentation, and resultant fatigue. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory impairment and disorientation in familiar environments, coupled with intrusive, ruminative thoughts related to panic and health anxieties. Dissociative experiences, such as depersonalization and derealization, are reported, alongside feelings of identity confusion and social withdrawal. The patient admits to self-harm ideation and reports substance use\u2014alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits and regular tobacco use\u2014as maladaptive coping mechanisms. There are also physical complaints, including headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort, which the patient perceives as dismissed by others.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a high degree of comorbidity involving mood dysregulation, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation, and substance use. The patient's symptom profile suggests a complex presentation with features consistent with depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative features. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use are significant risk factors requiring urgent clinical attention. \n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits severe affective symptoms, pervasive anxiety with panic attacks, dissociative experiences, cognitive impairments, and self-harm risk, compounded by maladaptive coping strategies involving substance use. These findings necessitate a comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a complex and distressing set of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You feel <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> most of the time, with persistent <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>overwhelmed</sym> feelings. Your <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> have increased, and you\u2019re having difficulty with <sym>sleep</sym>, waking frequently and feeling exhausted. You also describe <sym>panic attacks</sym> with physical symptoms like <sym>heart pounding</sym> and <sym>sweating</sym>, leading you to avoid situations that trigger these episodes. Cognitive issues such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <sym>dissociated</sym> from yourself or your surroundings are present, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed <sym>self-harm ideation</sym> and engage in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope with your distress. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomach aches are also noted, and you feel that your concerns are sometimes dismissed by others. Overall, your presentation indicates significant emotional distress, anxiety, and mood difficulties, compounded by cognitive and dissociative symptoms, as well as maladaptive coping strategies.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder (likely Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms (possibly depersonalization/derealization disorder)</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder (alcohol and tobacco)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> over the past two weeks suggest a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with somatic symptoms, ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, and feeling <sym>on edge</sym> point toward <med>Panic Disorder</med> and possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, including <sym>depersonalization</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>, supports a dissociative component, which can occur with severe anxiety or trauma-related conditions. The report of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> as maladaptive coping strategies increases the concern for safety and indicates <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. These overlapping symptoms suggest a complex clinical picture with comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, dissociative features, and substance misuse, requiring integrated assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk for self-harm, and explore any trauma history.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> and substance use, possibly involving crisis resources and close monitoring.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, anxiety, and substance use, and consider trauma-informed therapy if relevant.  \n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy to manage <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med>, potentially involving a psychiatrist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of social support, while encouraging gradual re-engagement with social activities.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
