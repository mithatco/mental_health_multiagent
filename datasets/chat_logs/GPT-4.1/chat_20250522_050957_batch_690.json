      "content": "You have shared a profound sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, along with difficulties in <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>concentration</sym>, and <sym>memory</sym>. Your feelings of <quote>being lost about yourself and what you should be doing</quote> and the tendency to <quote>withdraw from others and isolate</quote> highlight significant social and emotional struggles. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> further emphasize the severity of your current condition. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and your openness is a vital step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> given the persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The early morning awakenings, cognitive impairments, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints support this diagnosis. The presence of underlying worry and occasional feelings of dread suggest <sym>anxious features</sym>. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> also indicates the need for careful monitoring. While no psychotic symptoms are reported, the dissociative experiences and significant functional impairment reinforce the severity of the depressive episode. Differential diagnoses such as <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> or secondary mood symptoms related to medical conditions should be considered, but the overall presentation most closely fits a severe major depressive episode with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including safety planning and suicidality risk evaluation.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, considering agents effective for severe depression with anxious features.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Evaluate for potential medical causes of somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances, coordinating with a primary care provider if needed.  \n5. Monitor closely for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, with the possibility of involving crisis intervention services if necessary.",

There is notable psychomotor retardation evidenced by early morning awakenings, fatigue, and cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation. The patient reports significant social withdrawal and anhedonia, indicating possible social isolation and diminished engagement in previously enjoyed activities.\n\nAnxious symptomatology is also evident, characterized by underlying worry, occasional feelings of dread, and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. Somatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle aches, which may correlate with psychosomatic manifestations of distress.\n\nThe patient reports passive suicidal ideation without active plans or intent, which warrants close monitoring. There are no indications of hallucinations, delusions, or psychotic features. The absence of substance misuse or psychiatric history is noted, with no current use of illicit substances or medications outside prescribed parameters.\n\nPatterns suggest a mood disorder with significant affective and cognitive components, compounded by sleep disturbances, fatigue, and social withdrawal. The presence of dissociative experiences (feeling outside of oneself) and feelings of identity loss merit further assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, possibly with anxious features, and risk assessment for suicidality. The social withdrawal and somatic complaints may require integrated intervention strategies.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts and marked functional impairment. While no active self-harm behavior is reported, the severity of symptoms and ideation necessitate vigilant clinical evaluation and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive and anxious symptomatology with somatic complaints, cognitive disturbances, and social withdrawal, indicating the need for comprehensive diagnostic clarification and tailored intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a profound sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>, along with difficulties in <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>concentration</sym>, and <sym>memory</sym>. Your feelings of <quote>being lost about yourself and what you should be doing</quote> and the tendency to <quote>withdraw from others and isolate</quote> highlight significant social and emotional struggles. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle aches</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> further emphasize the severity of your current condition. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and your openness is a vital step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> given the persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The early morning awakenings, cognitive impairments, social withdrawal, and somatic complaints support this diagnosis. The presence of underlying worry and occasional feelings of dread suggest <sym>anxious features</sym>. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> also indicates the need for careful monitoring. While no psychotic symptoms are reported, the dissociative experiences and significant functional impairment reinforce the severity of the depressive episode. Differential diagnoses such as <med>Persistent Depressive Disorder</med> or secondary mood symptoms related to medical conditions should be considered, but the overall presentation most closely fits a severe major depressive episode with anxious features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including safety planning and suicidality risk evaluation.  \n2. Initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, considering agents effective for severe depression with anxious features.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns and develop coping strategies.  \n4. Evaluate for potential medical causes of somatic symptoms and sleep disturbances, coordinating with a primary care provider if needed.  \n5. Monitor closely for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, with the possibility of involving crisis intervention services if necessary.",
