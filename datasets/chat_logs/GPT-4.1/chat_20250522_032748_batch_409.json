Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get a broad understanding of your current mental health across different areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and our goal is to create a safe space where you can be open about what you're experiencing. The assessment consists of 23 questions about various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can respond honestly and comfortably. Are you ready for us to begin?"

You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with persistent worries and feeling on edge. Your sleep has been disrupted, waking early and feeling exhausted during the day, and you've observed some <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and feelings of dissociation, such as feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings. You mentioned occasional <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym> but no active plans or intent, and you tend to withdraw from others, avoiding social situations. Physical symptoms like back pain, headaches, and stomach discomfort are also present. Overall, these symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Dissociative Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>early morning awakenings</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, symptoms of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, including <sym>feeling detached from oneself or surroundings</sym>, point to <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> that may be secondary to or overlapping with depressive and anxiety processes. There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or medical conditions that fully explain these symptoms, making this a provisional combined diagnosis based on current presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for any medical comorbidities.  \n2. Consider starting an evidence-based <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help manage negative thoughts, worry, and dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation, given the passive death thoughts, and establish safety planning if necessary.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral techniques and, if appropriate, pharmacological support.  \n6. Explore additional supportive interventions, such as psychoeducation, social support, and possibly physical health evaluation for somatic complaints.",

There is evidence of depressive symptomatology characterized by low motivation, fatigue, and cognitive impairment (noted as memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments). The patient reports early morning awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep, contributing to daytime exhaustion. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are also prominent, including pervasive worry, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social withdrawal. Somatic complaints such as headaches, back pain, and gastrointestinal discomfort are reported, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress or comorbid physical health issues.\n\nPsychotic-like features are absent; however, the patient endorses dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self or environment) and passive ideation related to death without active suicidal intent. There are no indications of hallucinations, delusional thinking, or substance misuse. The patient demonstrates social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships, alongside feelings of being lost and uncertain of personal identity and life goals.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, possibly with comorbid anxiety features, and dissociative symptoms. The presence of passive death thoughts warrants careful monitoring for suicidal ideation, even in the absence of active plans. The patient's sleep disturbance and cognitive complaints further complicate the clinical picture and should be addressed.\n\nOverall, the responses suggest a complex presentation with mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, necessitating comprehensive assessment and potential intervention targeting mood stabilization, anxiety management, and psychosocial support.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical sensations over the past couple of weeks. You feel <sym>hopeless</sym> and have lost interest in activities that used to bring you happiness, describing a sense of numbness and sadness. You've also noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with persistent worries and feeling on edge. Your sleep has been disrupted, waking early and feeling exhausted during the day, and you've observed some <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and feelings of dissociation, such as feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings. You mentioned occasional <sym>passive thoughts about death</sym> but no active plans or intent, and you tend to withdraw from others, avoiding social situations. Physical symptoms like back pain, headaches, and stomach discomfort are also present. Overall, these symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Dissociative Features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over two weeks aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>early morning awakenings</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> further support this diagnosis. Additionally, symptoms of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, including <sym>feeling detached from oneself or surroundings</sym>, point to <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med> that may be secondary to or overlapping with depressive and anxiety processes. There are no indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or medical conditions that fully explain these symptoms, making this a provisional combined diagnosis based on current presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for any medical comorbidities.  \n2. Consider starting an evidence-based <med>antidepressant</med> medication, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help manage negative thoughts, worry, and dissociative experiences.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation, given the passive death thoughts, and establish safety planning if necessary.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral techniques and, if appropriate, pharmacological support.  \n6. Explore additional supportive interventions, such as psychoeducation, social support, and possibly physical health evaluation for somatic complaints.",
