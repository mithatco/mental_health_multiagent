You describe persistent <sym>depressed feelings</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a sense of numbness and indifference toward activities you once enjoyed. You also mention increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, feeling on edge, and difficulty sleeping, with very little rest and ongoing restlessness. Your worries are intense, and you often feel <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>fearful</sym> about having panic attacks or other problems, which leads you to avoid many situations. You\u2019ve experienced <sym>somatic complaints</sym> like headaches and stomach aches, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, as well as confusion about your identity and what you want in life. You have also reported <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and some <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, though you do not have any hallucinations or paranoia. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic complaints, with some concerns about safety that warrant careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms (Depersonalization/Derealization)</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>detachment from self and surroundings</sym>, along with confusion about identity, suggest dissociative features, which can occur in the context of mood and anxiety disorders, especially when stress is high. The somatic symptoms\u2014headaches, stomach aches, tension\u2014may be manifestations of psychological distress or somatic symptom overlap, but given their connection to emotional states and the lack of evidence for primary medical illness, they are likely part of the broader clinical picture. The <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, though not accompanied by active intent, indicate some risk that needs monitoring. Overall, the constellation of symptoms aligns most closely with a mood disorder with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and dissociation.  \n3. Consider pharmacological treatment with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) to address depressive and anxious symptoms, pending medical evaluation.  \n4. Explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms are prominent, and assess for history of trauma.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, safety, and treatment response.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including pervasive anhedonia, feelings of depression and hopelessness, and persistent irritability characterized by increased anger and agitation. These features suggest a depressive syndrome, potentially with mixed affective features. The patient reports substantial anxiety symptoms, including pervasive worry, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors related to panic and agoraphobia, which may suggest comorbid panic disorder or an anxiety spectrum disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches, stomach aches, and feelings of bodily tension, which could represent somatic manifestations of psychological distress or somatization. The presence of dissociative experiences\u2014feelings of detachment from self and surroundings\u2014and confusion about identity and purpose further indicate possible dissociative features or identities of depersonalization/derealization.\n\nThere are notable risk factors, including dark thoughts about self-harm, though no explicit intent or plan has been expressed. The patient denies hallucinations or paranoid ideation, and reports minimal substance use, with no recent alcohol overuse or tobacco use.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Enduring depressive symptoms with anhedonia and hopelessness.\n- High levels of anxiety, panic-related avoidance, and sleep disturbance.\n- Dissociative symptoms and identity confusion.\n- Somatic complaints correlating with psychological distress.\n- Presence of dark, intrusive thoughts related to self-harm risk.\n\n**Warning Signs and Risk Factors:**\n- Thoughts of self-harm, albeit without active intent, necessitate close monitoring.\n- Chronic sleep disruption and heightened anxiety levels may exacerbate mood symptoms.\n- Dissociative experiences warrant assessment for trauma history or dissociative disorders.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive features, comorbid anxiety and panic symptoms, dissociative experiences, and somatic complaints. The presence of passive self-harm ideation indicates a need for ongoing risk assessment and safety planning. Comprehensive evaluation of mood, anxiety, dissociative phenomena, and trauma history is recommended to inform targeted interventions.",

The clinical features described do not primarily align with a panic profile, which typically involves discrete episodes of intense fear with physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and chest pain, rather than persistent generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared with me that you are experiencing a range of difficult feelings and symptoms over the past two weeks. You describe persistent <sym>depressed feelings</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a sense of numbness and indifference toward activities you once enjoyed. You also mention increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym>, feeling on edge, and difficulty sleeping, with very little rest and ongoing restlessness. Your worries are intense, and you often feel <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>fearful</sym> about having panic attacks or other problems, which leads you to avoid many situations. You\u2019ve experienced <sym>somatic complaints</sym> like headaches and stomach aches, and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, as well as confusion about your identity and what you want in life. You have also reported <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and some <sym>dark thoughts about self-harm</sym>, though you do not have any hallucinations or paranoia. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and somatic complaints, with some concerns about safety that warrant careful attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms (Depersonalization/Derealization)</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym>, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>detachment from self and surroundings</sym>, along with confusion about identity, suggest dissociative features, which can occur in the context of mood and anxiety disorders, especially when stress is high. The somatic symptoms\u2014headaches, stomach aches, tension\u2014may be manifestations of psychological distress or somatic symptom overlap, but given their connection to emotional states and the lack of evidence for primary medical illness, they are likely part of the broader clinical picture. The <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, though not accompanied by active intent, indicate some risk that needs monitoring. Overall, the constellation of symptoms aligns most closely with a mood disorder with anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> and establish a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and dissociation.  \n3. Consider pharmacological treatment with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs) to address depressive and anxious symptoms, pending medical evaluation.  \n4. Explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms are prominent, and assess for history of trauma.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, safety, and treatment response.",
