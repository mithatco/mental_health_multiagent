This is a questionnaire designed to get an overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. It covers different areas like mood, anxiety, psychosis, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space where you can honestly discuss your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I'll ask about how you've been feeling and functioning over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you feeling restless and tired, and you also experience feelings of disconnection from yourself and your surroundings.

Cognitive impairments and sleep disturbances are also evident, contributing to overall functional impairment. The presence of fleeting suicidal ideation underscores the need for careful risk assessment and safety planning. The symptomatology suggests a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine diagnosis, differential considerations, and an appropriate treatment strategy.",

      "expected": "schizophrenia",
      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging and distressing experience. It sounds like you're struggling with a range of difficult feelings and symptoms, including <sym>persistent hopelessness and loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>. You've mentioned hearing <sym>voices and experiencing paranoid thoughts that others can read your mind or broadcast your thoughts</sym>, which can be frightening and confusing. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you feeling restless and tired, and you also experience feelings of disconnection from yourself and your surroundings. The intrusive and disturbing thoughts, along with occasional fleeting thoughts of self-harm, indicate that you're going through a lot right now. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and your honesty in sharing these experiences is important for guiding appropriate care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia with comorbid major depressive symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>auditory hallucinations (hearing voices)</sym>, paranoid beliefs such as <quote>believing thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read their mind</quote>, and <sym>derealization and depersonalization</sym>, which suggest <med>psychotic features</med>. Additionally, the patient exhibits <sym>persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep disturbances</sym>, consistent with <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The combination of psychotic experiences with mood symptoms strongly indicates a diagnosis of <med>schizophrenia</med> with depressive features. The avoidance behaviors and anxiety symptoms further complicate the clinical picture, but the core psychotic and mood symptoms are central to this assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, including assessment for <med>psychotic disorders</med> and <med>mood disorders</med>.  \n2. Initiate antipsychotic medication to address hallucinations and paranoid delusions, and consider antidepressant therapy if depressive symptoms are severe.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of <med>psychotic symptoms</med> and <med>depressive symptoms</med> to the patient and family.  \n4. Offer psychotherapy tailored to psychosis and mood symptoms, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, to help manage symptoms and improve functioning.  \n5. Address sleep issues with sleep hygiene strategies and, if necessary, pharmacological support.  \n6. Ensure safety by developing a crisis plan, especially given the presence of fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.  \n7. Consider evaluation for possible trauma or dissociative symptoms that may require additional treatment focus.",
