I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool used to get a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment includes 23 questions across different areas such as mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. I will ask you each question, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a complex and distressing set of experiences that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges. You described feeling <sym>depressed</sym> with a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, along with pervasive <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, which may be impulsive or driven by a need to cope. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>worried</sym>, and experiencing <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Sleep disturbances, including irregular sleep patterns, seem to contribute to your overall distress. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Additionally, there are concerns about <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational drugs\u2014as maladaptive coping strategies. Thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> have occurred, although no actions have been taken, which indicates an important safety concern. Your description points to a multifaceted clinical picture involving mood, anxiety, substance use, and identity-related symptoms, all of which warrant careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low motivation</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and impulsive behaviors suggests mood dysregulation. Anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, are also prominent, indicating significant comorbid anxiety features. Sleep irregularities and cognitive concerns, such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, further support a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum. The reported <sym>substance use</sym> (alcohol, cigarettes, recreational drugs) appears to be a maladaptive attempt to manage distress, which can exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The patient\u2019s <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight a risk that requires close monitoring. Overall, the symptom cluster aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with significant anxiety features and substance use issues, necessitating integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and collateral information gathering to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, including safety planning for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a multidimensional treatment plan that may include <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) and <sym>psychotherapy</sym> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and substance use behaviors.  \n3. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through targeted interventions, including motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services if needed.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or consultation with a sleep specialist if disturbances persist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping skills, and safety measures, especially regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> risk.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to evaluate treatment response, adjust medications, and ensure safety and stabilization.",

Prominent features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of depression, hopelessness, and low motivation, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. The report of increased irritability, irritability-related aggressive outbursts, and engagement in impulsive, risky behaviors (e.g., reckless driving) raise concern for potential mood dysregulation or impulse control issues.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are notably prominent, with reports of persistent worry, being on edge, avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, and episodic panic-like sensations, indicating possible generalized anxiety or panic components. Sleep disturbances are evident, with irregular sleep patterns and nocturnal awakenings contributing to overall functional impairment.\n\nCognitive complaints include recent memory difficulties and a sense of identity confusion or existential distress, which may warrant further exploration. Somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle pains are likely stress-related but merit assessment for somatic symptom severity.\n\nSubstance use behaviors are notable, with regular cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption (notably binge drinking), and recreational drug use, potentially serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient's acknowledgment of dark thoughts, passive suicidal ideation, and use of substances to manage distress highlight elevated risk factors for self-harm and necessitate careful safety assessment.\n\nPatterns indicate a high level of emotional distress, mood lability, and behavioral impulsivity, with comorbid anxiety and substance use issues. The presence of dissociative experiences (feeling detached) and identity uncertainty further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nKey risk factors include suicidal ideation, substance misuse, impulsivity, and possible mood instability. These warrant immediate attention to safety and a comprehensive diagnostic formulation.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, with substance use and risk behaviors that heighten clinical concern. Close monitoring, detailed assessment, and integrated intervention planning are recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing set of experiences that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges. You described feeling <sym>depressed</sym> with a lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, along with pervasive <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability</sym> and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, which may be impulsive or driven by a need to cope. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>worried</sym>, and experiencing <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>. Sleep disturbances, including irregular sleep patterns, seem to contribute to your overall distress. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> and a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Additionally, there are concerns about <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and recreational drugs\u2014as maladaptive coping strategies. Thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> have occurred, although no actions have been taken, which indicates an important safety concern. Your description points to a multifaceted clinical picture involving mood, anxiety, substance use, and identity-related symptoms, all of which warrant careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (Likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low motivation</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym> and impulsive behaviors suggests mood dysregulation. Anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, are also prominent, indicating significant comorbid anxiety features. Sleep irregularities and cognitive concerns, such as <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, further support a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum. The reported <sym>substance use</sym> (alcohol, cigarettes, recreational drugs) appears to be a maladaptive attempt to manage distress, which can exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The patient\u2019s <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight a risk that requires close monitoring. Overall, the symptom cluster aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with significant anxiety features and substance use issues, necessitating integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and collateral information gathering to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, including safety planning for <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a multidimensional treatment plan that may include <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) and <sym>psychotherapy</sym> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address mood, anxiety, and substance use behaviors.  \n3. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through targeted interventions, including motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services if needed.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene education or consultation with a sleep specialist if disturbances persist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, coping skills, and safety measures, especially regarding <sym>self-harm</sym> risk.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to evaluate treatment response, adjust medications, and ensure safety and stabilization.",
