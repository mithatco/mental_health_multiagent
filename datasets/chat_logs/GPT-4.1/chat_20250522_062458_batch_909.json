Please know that anything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Conduct a thorough clinical interview to clarify symptom duration, severity, and functional impairment, and to assess suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and establish regular monitoring.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.  \n6. Evaluate for any underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to symptoms, such as sleep disturbances or cognitive issues.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of numbness or indifference, alongside persistent depressive affect characterized by hopelessness and low mood over the past two weeks. There is evidence of irritability and increased energy levels, including reduced sleep duration and subjective restlessness, suggestive of possible hypomanic or mixed features. The patient reports heightened anxiety, particularly in social contexts, with avoidance behaviors, somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches linked to stress, and hypervigilance regarding social judgment. Intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment or derealization are present, alongside difficulties with sleep quality and memory, which may reflect underlying anxiety or mood-related disturbances.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with notable social withdrawal and avoidance. The absence of psychotic symptoms, problematic substance use, or disinhibited risk-taking behaviors is noted. The patient admits to passive suicidal ideation without intent or plan, which warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\nClinically, these responses suggest significant depressive symptoms with possible features of an anxiety disorder, potentially compounded by dissociative experiences. The patient's self-reported sleep disturbances, cognitive concerns, and social avoidance are relevant for diagnostic considerations and treatment planning. Risk factors include passive suicidal thoughts and significant distress related to social anxiety and emotional dysregulation. Overall, the presentation warrants a comprehensive mental health evaluation, with attention to mood stabilization, anxiety management, and safety assessment.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that recently you\u2019ve been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical sensations. You described feeling <sym>numb or indifferent</sym> toward activities you once enjoyed, along with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym>, including <sym>reduced sleep</sym> hours but feeling full of energy. Anxiety has been significant for you, especially around social situations, leading you to <sym>avoid</sym> many gatherings. You\u2019ve experienced <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches linked to stress, and intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> that trouble you. You also described episodes of <sym>derealization or feeling detached</sym> and difficulties with <sym>sleep quality</sym> and <sym>memory</sym>. While you\u2019ve had some passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, you clarified that you would not act on them. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex picture of mood disturbance, anxiety, and cognitive challenges, which seem to significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of pervasive <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of heightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>social avoidance</sym> and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym>, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The symptoms of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> may indicate dissociative experiences or heightened stress responses but do not currently point to psychotic features. The patient\u2019s reports of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> necessitate safety monitoring. The overall presentation does not fully meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or other specific psychotic or trauma-related disorders but indicates a complex mood and anxiety profile requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview to clarify symptom duration, severity, and functional impairment, and to assess suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and establish regular monitoring.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.  \n5. Explore stress management and relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.  \n6. Evaluate for any underlying medical or neurological conditions contributing to symptoms, such as sleep disturbances or cognitive issues.",
