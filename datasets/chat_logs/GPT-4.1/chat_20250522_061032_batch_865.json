This assessment helps us understand various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing across different areas. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. We'll go through 23 questions that cover different aspects of mental health, and I will ask you to respond honestly about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks.

Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess suicidality, and explore possible underlying or comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or counselor for ongoing psychotherapy.  \n4.

Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies, and evaluate for possible medical causes of physical symptoms if they persist.  \n6.

Key features include persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and pervasive irritability. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep, contributing to ongoing fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient reports physical symptoms (headaches, back pain) with no apparent medical etiology and expresses feelings of emotional and social withdrawal, including isolation, detachment, and a sense of identity confusion. Anxiety manifests as constant worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors. Though no active suicidal plans are disclosed, thoughts of death or self-harm are present, warranting careful assessment of suicide risk. There are no indications of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse. The pattern suggests a mood disorder with prominent depressive and anxious components, potentially comorbid with cognitive or dissociative features.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**\n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and psychomotor disturbances\n- Anxiety features, including generalized worry, irritability, and avoidance\n- Cognitive impairment, notably memory issues and disorientation\n- Sleep disruption with early awakening and non-restorative rest\n- Feelings of depersonalization or dissociation\n- Passive death ideation without active suicidal intent\n\n**Risk factors/warning signs:**\n- Persistent thoughts about death\n- Feelings of hopelessness and isolation\n- Sleep disturbances and cognitive decline\n- No current evidence of plan or intent, yet proximity to risk warrants monitoring\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by severe depressive and anxious symptomatology, cognitive disturbances, and social withdrawal. These signs suggest the need for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of mood disorder severity, suicidality, and possible cognitive impairment. Close monitoring and supportive interventions are recommended to address current distress and prevent escalation of risk.",

      "predicted": "You are going through a very difficult time, experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you previously enjoyed, and ongoing <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious symptoms</sym>. You\u2019ve described feeling <sym>exhausted</sym>, having trouble <sym>sleeping</sym> properly, especially waking up very early, and noticing difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from yourself and others. Your physical symptoms, like headaches and back pain, seem to add to your distress, and your thoughts about <sym>death</sym> or not wanting to be here show that you're feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re facing a complex mix of emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges that are impacting your daily functioning and sense of self.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with anxious features and cognitive impairment</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a prolonged <sym>depressed mood</sym> with <sym>anhedonia</sym>, pervasive <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Sleep disturbances are evident through early awakening and non-restorative sleep, contributing to fatigue and cognitive issues such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation. The presence of <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain with no medical cause, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, suggests a severe depressive episode with possible dissociative features. The patient\u2019s <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including constant worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance, further support a diagnosis of depression with anxious features. Thoughts of <sym>death</sym> indicate a risk that requires careful monitoring, although no active plans or intent are reported. The combination of mood, cognitive, physical, and anxiety symptoms points toward a major depressive episode with comorbid anxiety and cognitive disturbances, possibly exacerbated by dissociative experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess suicidality, and explore possible underlying or comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate a treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.  \n3. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or counselor for ongoing psychotherapy.  \n4. Monitor for any worsening of symptoms or emergence of active suicidal thoughts, ensuring safety planning as needed.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies, and evaluate for possible medical causes of physical symptoms if they persist.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety to support understanding and coping strategies.",
