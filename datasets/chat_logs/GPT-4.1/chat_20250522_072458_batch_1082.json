Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get a broad picture of your mental health across different areas, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. It's a confidential space, and your honest responses are important for understanding your experiences and planning any support or treatment you might need. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn. You can answer openly and naturally, and if anything feels uncomfortable, just let me know. Are you ready to get started?"

The presence of <sym>mood disturbances</sym>, including <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>sleep problems</sym> and <sym>cognitive issues</sym>, point to a serious underlying mental health concern. Your disclosure of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> further highlight the importance of urgent attention and support. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, combined with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or dissociative symptoms, and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis is based on persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>auditory hallucinations (hearing voices)</sym>, and <sym>paranoia</sym> suggest possible <med>psychotic features</med> associated with severe depression or mood disorder.

The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> pattern suggest coping mechanisms and physiological impacts of these conditions. The suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts are concerning and indicate a high risk that requires immediate attention. Overall, this feels like a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, psychotic-like experiences, dissociation, and substance use, which often co-occur and require integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis plan, including suicide risk management.  \n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for comprehensive evaluation, possible medication management (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics), and stabilization.  \n3. Initiate psychotherapy focusing on mood stabilization, trauma processing (such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy), and coping skills.  \n4. Address substance use through integrated treatment programs, including counseling and support groups.  \n5. Regular monitoring of symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, psychotic features, and substance use, with ongoing risk assessment.  \n6. Encourage engagement with social support systems and consider case management to assist with social and functional recovery.",

There is evidence of depressive symptomatology with reports of anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal, and affective flattening. The patient also exhibits symptoms consistent with anxiety disorders, including heightened worry, restlessness, sleep disturbances, and avoidance behaviors, particularly social avoidance. Notably, reports of panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of dissociation (depersonalization/derealization) suggest comorbid anxiety and dissociative features.\n\nThe patient endorses psychotic-like experiences, such as auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid ideation (feeling misunderstood and not taken seriously), which may warrant further assessment for psychotic processes or severe mood disorder with psychotic features. There are also indications of impulsivity and risky behaviors, including increased goal-directed activity, impulsive project initiation, and substance use\u2014specifically alcohol and tobacco, with a pattern of increased consumption and self-medication.\n\nSleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulty maintaining sleep and non-restorative sleep contributing to overall functional impairment. Cognitive concerns include forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating, aligning with neurovegetative symptoms. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors, such as repetitive mental acts, are reported, suggesting possible obsessive features.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include current suicidal ideation with active thoughts of self-harm, recent substance misuse, and behavioral impulsivity. The patient's self-reported feelings of disconnection, identity questioning, and social withdrawal further indicate significant distress and potential risk for deterioration without intervention.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture is characterized by a complex presentation of mood disorder with prominent anxiety, psychotic-like experiences, substance use, and dissociative symptoms, with notable risk factors for self-harm and functional impairment. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and safety assessment are indicated to clarify diagnosis and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing set of symptoms that indicate you are experiencing significant emotional and psychological challenges. It\u2019s understandable that feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> are weighing heavily on you, and your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociation</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> suggest a high level of distress. The presence of <sym>mood disturbances</sym>, including <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>sleep problems</sym> and <sym>cognitive issues</sym>, point to a serious underlying mental health concern. Your disclosure of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> further highlight the importance of urgent attention and support. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot, and help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, possibly Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, combined with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or dissociative symptoms, and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis is based on persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and <sym>feelings of emptiness</sym>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>auditory hallucinations (hearing voices)</sym>, and <sym>paranoia</sym> suggest possible <med>psychotic features</med> associated with severe depression or mood disorder. Symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and <sym>hyperarousal</sym>, support a comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possibly trauma-related features, such as dissociation and identity questioning, which may indicate underlying <med>PTSD or dissociative symptoms</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> pattern suggest coping mechanisms and physiological impacts of these conditions. The suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts are concerning and indicate a high risk that requires immediate attention. Overall, this feels like a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, psychotic-like experiences, dissociation, and substance use, which often co-occur and require integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis plan, including suicide risk management.  \n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for comprehensive evaluation, possible medication management (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics), and stabilization.  \n3. Initiate psychotherapy focusing on mood stabilization, trauma processing (such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy), and coping skills.  \n4. Address substance use through integrated treatment programs, including counseling and support groups.  \n5. Regular monitoring of symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, psychotic features, and substance use, with ongoing risk assessment.  \n6. Encourage engagement with social support systems and consider case management to assist with social and functional recovery.",
