This questionnaire is designed to give us a broad overview of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering various areas like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time, and your honest answers will help guide any further support or treatment you might need. Are you ready for us to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal. You\u2019ve also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including constant worry, irritability, panic attacks, and avoidance of certain situations, which suggest a high level of distress. Additionally, you\u2019ve reported <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and feelings of dissociation, like feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Your use of substances, including alcohol and unprescribed medications, appears to be a maladaptive way to cope with your emotional pain. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, even if not acted upon, indicates a serious concern that needs immediate attention. Overall, it seems you are struggling with multiple overlapping issues that significantly impair your well-being and functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med>, <med>Panic Attacks</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The concurrent symptoms of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest a significant <sym>anxiety component</sym>, meeting criteria for <med>Anxious Features</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings, along with identity confusion, point toward <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> that may be part of the depressive or anxiety spectrum or indicative of a dissociative component. The presence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and compulsive behaviors may reflect obsessive-compulsive features or related disturbances. The reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants urgent intervention. Furthermore, ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, cigarette smoking, and unprescribed medication use\u2014likely exacerbates mental health symptoms and complicates the clinical picture. The overall presentation suggests a complex, multifaceted disorder requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment, including immediate safety planning and intervention for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, including assessment of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.  \n3. Develop a coordinated treatment plan incorporating psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy), pharmacotherapy as appropriate, and interventions targeting <sym>substance use</sym>.  \n4. Refer for medical evaluation to rule out or address any physical health issues contributing to symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and somatic complaints.  \n5. Provide ongoing monitoring of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and dissociative symptoms, with safety plans in place.  \n6. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and support services to reduce harmful consumption and improve overall mental health.",

Anxiety-related symptoms are prominent, including generalized worry, irritability, sleep disturbances, and panic attacks, suggesting comorbid anxiety pathology. The patient reports intrusive negative thoughts, compulsive behaviors such as checking or cleaning, and dissociative experiences, which may point to obsessive-compulsive or related features. Cognitive concerns include forgetfulness and disorientation, raising questions about possible cognitive impairment or dissociative episodes. The presence of suicidal ideation, specifically dark thoughts about self-harm, constitutes a notable risk factor requiring urgent attention.\n\nSubstance use is notable, with reported alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, ongoing cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed use of medications, including painkillers and other drugs, which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient's reports of feeling disconnected from self and environment, alongside identity confusion, further suggest dissociative symptoms or depersonalization phenomena.\n\nPatterns indicate a complex presentation involving mood dysregulation, anxiety, dissociative experiences, and substance misuse. These symptoms collectively elevate clinical concern for mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, possible dissociative features, and substance use disorder, with an immediate need to assess suicide risk and establish safety. Further comprehensive assessment is warranted to clarify diagnoses, evaluate cognitive functioning, and develop an integrated treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal. You\u2019ve also described pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including constant worry, irritability, panic attacks, and avoidance of certain situations, which suggest a high level of distress. Additionally, you\u2019ve reported <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and feelings of dissociation, like feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Your use of substances, including alcohol and unprescribed medications, appears to be a maladaptive way to cope with your emotional pain. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, even if not acted upon, indicates a serious concern that needs immediate attention. Overall, it seems you are struggling with multiple overlapping issues that significantly impair your well-being and functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med>, <med>Panic Attacks</med>, <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The concurrent symptoms of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest a significant <sym>anxiety component</sym>, meeting criteria for <med>Anxious Features</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings, along with identity confusion, point toward <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> that may be part of the depressive or anxiety spectrum or indicative of a dissociative component. The presence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and compulsive behaviors may reflect obsessive-compulsive features or related disturbances. The reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants urgent intervention. Furthermore, ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, cigarette smoking, and unprescribed medication use\u2014likely exacerbates mental health symptoms and complicates the clinical picture. The overall presentation suggests a complex, multifaceted disorder requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment, including immediate safety planning and intervention for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, including assessment of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.  \n3. Develop a coordinated treatment plan incorporating psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-informed therapy), pharmacotherapy as appropriate, and interventions targeting <sym>substance use</sym>.  \n4. Refer for medical evaluation to rule out or address any physical health issues contributing to symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and somatic complaints.  \n5. Provide ongoing monitoring of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and dissociative symptoms, with safety plans in place.  \n6. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and support services to reduce harmful consumption and improve overall mental health.",
