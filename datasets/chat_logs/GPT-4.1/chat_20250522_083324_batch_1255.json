Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different areas. Its purpose is to help us get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. I want to assure you that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. We will go through 23 questions together, one by one. Are you ready to begin?"

Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including possible hospitalization if risk remains high.\n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n4. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs) to address mood, anxiety, and obsessive features.\n5. Refer for medical evaluation of somatic complaints and sleep issues.\n6. Engage in regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.\n7. Incorporate supportive interventions such as psychoeducation, coping strategies, and social support enhancement.",

There are prominent mood disturbances characterized by feelings of depression and irritability, alongside reports of intrusive thoughts related to past mistakes. Anxiety symptoms are evidenced by pervasive worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social settings. Sleep disturbance is notable, with initial and fragmented sleep contributing to potential sleep dysregulation. Cognitive concerns include occasional memory lapses and disorientation, which may warrant further assessment.\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, possibly somatized manifestations of psychological distress. Repetitive intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors suggest the presence of obsessive features. Dissociative experiences, including feelings of detachment and unreality, are also reported. There are indications of identity disturbance and emotional numbing, with reduced engagement in relationships and diminished enjoyment of previously pleasurable activities. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, including alcohol consumption, increased smoking, and self-medication with prescription medications and marijuana.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include expressed suicidal ideation with dark thoughts of self-harm and feelings of despair, alongside substance misuse, which heightens the potential for harm. The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal further compound clinical concern.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with a complex presentation characterized by depressive symptoms, anxiety, obsessive features, dissociative phenomena, sleep disturbances, and substance use, alongside active suicidal ideation. These findings suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning to address the multifaceted nature of their mental health needs.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a distressing array of symptoms and experiences that suggest you are going through a very challenging time. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re feeling <sym>depressed</sym>, with a persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You\u2019ve also mentioned <sym>feelings of anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>. Sleep difficulties, such as waking early and feeling restless, have been affecting your rest, and you\u2019ve experienced <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, and some <sym>cognitive lapses</sym>. Your report of <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> indicates significant distress and risk. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed given these symptoms, and it\u2019s important to recognize that help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits classic symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>worthlessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and ritualistic behaviors suggests obsessive-compulsive tendencies, while pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, dissociative experiences, and substance use further complicate the clinical picture, indicating a severe level of distress that requires comprehensive treatment. The <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are particularly concerning and necessitate immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for <sym>suicidality</sym> and <sym>substance misuse</sym>.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including possible hospitalization if risk remains high.\n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n4. Consider pharmacotherapy with <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs) to address mood, anxiety, and obsessive features.\n5. Refer for medical evaluation of somatic complaints and sleep issues.\n6. Engage in regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.\n7. Incorporate supportive interventions such as psychoeducation, coping strategies, and social support enhancement.",
