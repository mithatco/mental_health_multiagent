This questionnaire covers various areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to be honest.

Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any risk factors, including active suicidal ideation.  \n2. Develop a tailored treatment plan incorporating evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and social avoidance.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, after careful assessment, especially if symptoms interfere significantly with daily functioning.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",

Core features include persistent anhedonia and depressed mood over the past two weeks, accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and low energy despite decreased sleep duration. The patient reports substantial irritability, social withdrawal, and avoidance behaviors consistent with social anxiety. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including pervasive worry, hypervigilance, panic attacks, and avoidance of social situations, suggesting comorbid generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder. Sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and fatigue during the day are evident, alongside cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and concentration issues. Intrusive thoughts related to judgment and embarrassment reinforce the presence of obsessive-compulsive features or ruminative patterns.\n\nDissociative symptoms are milder but present, with episodes of depersonalization or derealization noted. The patient also reports questioning self-identity and experiencing feelings of disconnection, which warrants further exploration for dissociative phenomena. Risk factors include passive SI thoughts without active intent or plan, and no current evidence of psychosis or substance misuse. The patient denies substance use or medication misuse, reducing immediate concerns regarding intoxication or withdrawal.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture suggests a complex presentation involving major depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety, social avoidance, and mild dissociative experiences. These findings necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic formulation and targeted intervention plan to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, with close monitoring for any escalation in SI or other risk factors.",

      "predicted": "You are going through a challenging time with a range of distressing feelings and experiences. You describe persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. Despite sleeping less, you still feel restless and have difficulty sleeping, which contributes to feelings of exhaustion during the day. You also experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, especially in social situations, leading to avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you have noticed some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about being judged, as well as episodes of feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself or your surroundings. These symptoms seem interconnected and are impacting your overall functioning and well-being. I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you, and your openness helps us understand what you're experiencing so we can find the best way to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely social anxiety disorder) and mild <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbance, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially social anxiety symptoms such as <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance of social situations, suggest a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> indicate mild <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety disorders. There are no indications of psychosis or substance misuse, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without intent do not currently suggest active risk but warrant monitoring. The constellation of symptoms points toward a complex presentation involving mood dysregulation, anxiety, and dissociative experiences, necessitating a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any risk factors, including active suicidal ideation.  \n2. Develop a tailored treatment plan incorporating evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and social avoidance.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, after careful assessment, especially if symptoms interfere significantly with daily functioning.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",
