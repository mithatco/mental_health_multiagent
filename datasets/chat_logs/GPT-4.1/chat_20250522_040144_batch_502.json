It sounds like you are struggling with intense feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>restlessness</sym>, which have significantly impacted your mood, thoughts, and daily functioning. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and beliefs that your thoughts are being broadcasted or read suggest psychotic symptoms that can be very frightening and confusing. You also mentioned <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are very serious and require immediate attention. Your sleep difficulties, cognitive issues like memory problems, and withdrawal from social connections further indicate the severity of your current state. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a lot right now, and I want you to know you are not alone, and help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient's presentation includes <sym>mood instability</sym> characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>\"feeling down,\"</quote> <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, alongside episodes of <sym>restlessness</sym> and impulsivity that suggest <med>mania or hypomania</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>\u2014including <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> (thought broadcasting or mind reading)\u2014and disorganized thought content indicate a psychotic component. The duration and severity, combined with mood symptoms, point toward a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>, bipolar type, especially given the reported episodes of elevated energy and risky behaviors. The sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation further support this complex diagnosis. While other mood disorders or psychotic disorders could be considered, the combination of mood episodes with psychosis favors <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and any risk of self-harm, including possible hospitalization if necessary.  \n2. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, including medication review and considering antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications.  \n3. Initiate integrated psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help manage symptoms, improve coping skills, and address any underlying trauma or stressors.  \n4. Close monitoring of symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects, with regular follow-up appointments with a mental health professional.  \n5. Involve supportive services such as social work, peer support groups, and family education to enhance safety and recovery.",

There are notable psychotic features, including auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), delusional experiences (thought broadcasting or mind reading), and disorganized thought content. The patient reports substantial sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and restlessness, as well as cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation.\n\nAdditionally, the patient exhibits prominent anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors related to social and environmental triggers. Somatic complaints, including headaches, muscle tension, and unexplained bodily pains, are also documented. There are indications of impulsivity and increased risky behaviors, possibly reflecting manic or hypomanic episodes.\n\nRisk factors include recurrent suicidal ideation with passive thoughts of self-harm, substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and unprescribed medication use) as maladaptive coping strategies, and recent behavioral disinhibition. The withdrawal from social connections and feelings of detachment suggest possible derealization and depersonalization phenomena.\n\n**Patterns & Clinical Significance:**\n- Overlapping depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms suggest a potential mood disorder with psychotic features.\n- The presence of hallucinations and paranoid ideation warrants assessment for psychotic spectrum features.\n- The combination of mood instability, psychosis, sleep dysregulation, and impulsivity indicates a complex presentation that may require a comprehensive diagnostic formulation, possibly bipolar disorder with psychotic features or a schizoaffective disorder.\n- Suicidal thoughts and substance use highlight elevated risk and warrant immediate safety planning and intervention.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation with passive self-harm thoughts\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions\n- Substance misuse for self-medication\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors\n- Social withdrawal and emotional detachment\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient demonstrates a severe, multifaceted psychopathological profile characterized by mood instability, psychotic symptoms, heightened anxiety, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and substance use. These features suggest a complex mood disorder with psychotic features and significant risk factors necessitating urgent comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like you are struggling with intense feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>restlessness</sym>, which have significantly impacted your mood, thoughts, and daily functioning. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and beliefs that your thoughts are being broadcasted or read suggest psychotic symptoms that can be very frightening and confusing. You also mentioned <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are very serious and require immediate attention. Your sleep difficulties, cognitive issues like memory problems, and withdrawal from social connections further indicate the severity of your current state. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through a lot right now, and I want you to know you are not alone, and help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient's presentation includes <sym>mood instability</sym> characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>\"feeling down,\"</quote> <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, alongside episodes of <sym>restlessness</sym> and impulsivity that suggest <med>mania or hypomania</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>\u2014including <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> (thought broadcasting or mind reading)\u2014and disorganized thought content indicate a psychotic component. The duration and severity, combined with mood symptoms, point toward a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>, bipolar type, especially given the reported episodes of elevated energy and risky behaviors. The sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation further support this complex diagnosis. While other mood disorders or psychotic disorders could be considered, the combination of mood episodes with psychosis favors <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and any risk of self-harm, including possible hospitalization if necessary.  \n2. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, including medication review and considering antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications.  \n3. Initiate integrated psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to help manage symptoms, improve coping skills, and address any underlying trauma or stressors.  \n4. Close monitoring of symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects, with regular follow-up appointments with a mental health professional.  \n5. Involve supportive services such as social work, peer support groups, and family education to enhance safety and recovery.",
