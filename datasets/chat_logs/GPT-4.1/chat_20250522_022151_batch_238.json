Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to help us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering various domains, and I will ask each one in turn. Please answer honestly and openly, and let me know if you need any clarification. Are you ready to begin?"

Sleep problems like waking during the night and feeling restless are impacting your energy and focus. You\u2019ve noted <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about past mistakes, feelings of <sym>detachment or depersonalization</sym>, and a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and engaging in <sym>substance use</sym> as ways to cope with your feelings. These symptoms suggest a significant emotional burden affecting your mood, cognition, and behavior, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and features of dissociation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's self-reported symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as worry, panic, and avoidance, support an additional component of <sym>anxious distress</sym>. The reports of <sym>detachment or dissociation</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, suggest dissociative features that can sometimes co-occur with mood disorders. The patient's <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and recent substance use increase concern for risk and maladaptive coping. Overall, this constellation indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety and dissociative features, requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including risk for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use, and consider immediate intervention if risk escalates.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting mood and anxiety symptoms, and explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and develop coping strategies to manage symptoms.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor treatment response and adjust interventions as needed.",

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"), persistent feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and irritability-related interpersonal difficulties. The patient reports moderate anxiety, characterized by worry about the future, social discomfort, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, suggesting an anxiety disorder component. Sleep disturbances, notably insomnia with early awakenings and restlessness, alongside cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness and disorientation, are evident and may reflect underlying mood or neurocognitive issues.\n\nThe patient also endorses intrusive, ruminative thoughts about past mistakes, feelings of emotional detachment or depersonalization, and a sense of identity confusion, which could point toward dissociative or mood disturbances. Additionally, reports of self-harm ideation (\"dark thoughts\" about not waking up) and substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, and misuse of medications) constitute significant risk factors for self-harm and indicate maladaptive coping strategies.\n\nPatterns observed include pervasive mood symptoms with depressive features, heightened anxiety and avoidance behaviors, cognitive impairments, and maladaptive behavioral responses such as substance use. The presentation suggests possible major depressive disorder with anxious distress, and potentially comorbid dissociative features or other mood/anxiety spectrum disorders.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include elevated risk for self-harm, substance misuse, and functional impairment across social and occupational domains. The patient\u2019s subjective experiences of emotional numbness, identity confusion, and dissociation warrant further assessment for underlying mood or dissociative disorders, as well as evaluation of risk factors for suicidality.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation marked by depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive disturbances, dissociative experiences, and self-harm ideation, compounded by maladaptive coping mechanisms involving substance use. Comprehensive assessment and targeted intervention are recommended to address these multifaceted concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of ongoing emotional distress, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>irritability</sym>. You also experience significant <sym>anxiety</sym> that affects your daily life, such as <sym>worry about the future</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, along with avoidance behaviors. Sleep problems like waking during the night and feeling restless are impacting your energy and focus. You\u2019ve noted <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about past mistakes, feelings of <sym>detachment or depersonalization</sym>, and a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and engaging in <sym>substance use</sym> as ways to cope with your feelings. These symptoms suggest a significant emotional burden affecting your mood, cognition, and behavior, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your path forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress and features of dissociation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's self-reported symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as worry, panic, and avoidance, support an additional component of <sym>anxious distress</sym>. The reports of <sym>detachment or dissociation</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, suggest dissociative features that can sometimes co-occur with mood disorders. The patient's <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and recent substance use increase concern for risk and maladaptive coping. Overall, this constellation indicates a mood disorder with significant anxiety and dissociative features, requiring comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, including risk for self-harm.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use, and consider immediate intervention if risk escalates.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting mood and anxiety symptoms, and explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders and develop coping strategies to manage symptoms.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor treatment response and adjust interventions as needed.",
