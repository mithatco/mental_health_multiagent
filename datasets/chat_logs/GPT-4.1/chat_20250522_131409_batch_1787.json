This combination of symptoms suggests a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, dissociative features, and substance use, all of which are impacting your overall well-being and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder), <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (including alcohol, nicotine, and substances).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

The substance use, including recent alcohol overconsumption, tobacco, and misuse of prescription and recreational drugs, complicates the clinical picture and may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, increasing risk for worsening mental health and safety concerns. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk of <sym>self-harm</sym>, and evaluate substance use severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan, including immediate intervention if suicidal thoughts intensify.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety, along with trauma-focused interventions if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), after careful assessment and collaboration.  \n5. Refer for substance use treatment and support, including counseling or detoxification if needed.  \n6. Monitor sleep patterns and address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.  \n7.

There are notable symptoms of anxiety, such as persistent worry, heightened irritability, restlessness, and panic episodes, alongside avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. The patient reports sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, accompanied by fatigue and irritability. Cognitive concerns are evident, including forgetfulness and disorientation, suggesting possible cognitive or dissociative experiences.\n\nIntrusive and distressing thoughts, including disturbing images and self-harm ideation, are prominent, indicating elevated suicide risk. The patient also reports feelings of detachment or dissociation, which may reflect dissociative symptoms. Physical complaints such as unexplained headaches and body aches are present but their clinical significance remains to be further evaluated.\n\nSubstance use appears problematic, with recent alcohol overconsumption, habitual cigarette smoking, tobacco use during stress, and recent misuse of prescription painkillers and recreational drugs. These behaviors may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms and increase clinical risk.\n\nPatterns of concern include mood disturbance, anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences, cognitive difficulties, and substance misuse. The presence of suicidal ideation, panic episodes, and substance use constitute notable risk factors requiring immediate assessment and intervention.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, significant anxiety, dissociative features, sleep disturbance, cognitive concerns, and substance misuse, with associated risk factors for self-harm and impaired functioning. Further comprehensive evaluation is warranted to determine diagnosis, safety, and appropriate treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and complex experience. You\u2019re clearly struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and a sense of being <quote>lost</quote>. Alongside these mood symptoms, you\u2019re experiencing significant <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014worry, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of situations that trigger your fears. You\u2019ve also reported <sym>trouble sleeping</sym>, feelings of <sym>detachment or dissociation</sym>, and some cognitive difficulties like <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. Your responses indicate ongoing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, some of which are <sym>disturbing</sym> and have led to thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>. Substance use appears to be a way you\u2019re coping, with recent alcohol overuse, tobacco use, and misuse of prescription medication and recreational drugs. This combination of symptoms suggests a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, dissociative features, and substance use, all of which are impacting your overall well-being and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder), <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (including alcohol, nicotine, and substances).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggests a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>\u2014such as feeling <sym>detached from oneself</sym>\u2014indicate dissociative symptoms that can coexist with mood and anxiety disorders. The substance use, including recent alcohol overconsumption, tobacco, and misuse of prescription and recreational drugs, complicates the clinical picture and may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, increasing risk for worsening mental health and safety concerns. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess risk of <sym>self-harm</sym>, and evaluate substance use severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan, including immediate intervention if suicidal thoughts intensify.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety, along with trauma-focused interventions if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), after careful assessment and collaboration.  \n5. Refer for substance use treatment and support, including counseling or detoxification if needed.  \n6. Monitor sleep patterns and address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.  \n7. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and ensure ongoing supportive follow-up.",
