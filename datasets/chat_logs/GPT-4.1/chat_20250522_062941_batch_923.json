Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. We will go through 23 questions covering various symptoms and feelings. I'll ask one question at a time, and you can answer as openly as you feel comfortable. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019ve described experiencing <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which can be frightening and isolating. Your sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties like <sym>memory problems</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> \u2014 feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings \u2014 all point toward significant emotional and psychological challenges. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym>, and <sym>impulsivity</sym> suggest a high level of distress and risk that needs careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features, likely severe depression with psychotic symptoms and substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoia</sym>, and thought broadcasting indicate <sym>psychotic features</sym>. The significant sleep disruption, cognitive impairments, dissociative feelings, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's ongoing substance use \u2014 alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications \u2014 may be exacerbating or maintaining the severity of symptoms. The clinical picture suggests a severe, co-occurring presentation of depression with psychotic features and substance use disorder, increasing the urgency for comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess suicide risk, and explore trauma history.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including close monitoring and possibly hospitalization if risk escalates.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant combined with an antipsychotic medication to target mood and psychotic symptoms.\n4. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, cognition, and substance use.\n5. Implement integrated treatment for substance use disorder, including motivational interviewing and support groups.\n6. Collaborate with medical providers to evaluate and manage sleep disturbances and cognitive issues.\n7. Establish regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

There are prominent symptoms of irritability, heightened anxiety, and paranoid ideation, with reports of auditory hallucinations and thought broadcasting, indicating possible psychotic features. Sleep disturbance is significant, evidenced by insomnia and non-restorative sleep, coupled with cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and disorientation. The patient reports dissociative symptoms, including depersonalization and derealization, as well as feelings of emotional numbness and social withdrawal, suggesting possible affective and dissociative pathology.\n\nPattern analysis reveals concurrent mood, anxiety, psychotic, and dissociative symptoms, with substance use behaviors\u2014including alcohol and nicotine consumption and non-prescribed medication use\u2014serving as potential maladaptive coping mechanisms. There are notable risk factors for self-harm, including prior thoughts of self-injury and substance misuse, indicating heightened clinical concern for suicidality.\n\nOverall, the symptomatology reflects a severe, multi-dimensional psychopathological profile requiring comprehensive assessment. The presence of psychotic phenomena, mood dysregulation, dissociation, and substance use warrants careful differential diagnosis and urgent clinical attention to safety, with consideration for mood disorder with psychotic features, comorbid substance use disorder, and dissociative or trauma-related conditions.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing and complex picture of your mental health, including persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with <sym>depressive mood</sym> that makes it difficult for you to find joy or motivation. You\u2019ve described experiencing <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>paranoid thoughts</sym>, which can be frightening and isolating. Your sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties like <sym>memory problems</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> \u2014 feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings \u2014 all point toward significant emotional and psychological challenges. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym>, and <sym>impulsivity</sym> suggest a high level of distress and risk that needs careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood disorder with psychotic features, likely severe depression with psychotic symptoms and substance use disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoia</sym>, and thought broadcasting indicate <sym>psychotic features</sym>. The significant sleep disruption, cognitive impairments, dissociative feelings, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's ongoing substance use \u2014 alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications \u2014 may be exacerbating or maintaining the severity of symptoms. The clinical picture suggests a severe, co-occurring presentation of depression with psychotic features and substance use disorder, increasing the urgency for comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess suicide risk, and explore trauma history.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including close monitoring and possibly hospitalization if risk escalates.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant combined with an antipsychotic medication to target mood and psychotic symptoms.\n4. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, cognition, and substance use.\n5. Implement integrated treatment for substance use disorder, including motivational interviewing and support groups.\n6. Collaborate with medical providers to evaluate and manage sleep disturbances and cognitive issues.\n7. Establish regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
