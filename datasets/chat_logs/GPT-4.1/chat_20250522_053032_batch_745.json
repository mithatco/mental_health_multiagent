      "content": "You have shared a wide range of distressing experiences that reflect significant emotional and perceptual difficulties. You mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also described heightened <sym>anxiety</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, including physical sensations like difficulty breathing and feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, you reported experiencing <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>\u2014hearing voices that others do not hear\u2014and paranoid thoughts, such as feeling watched or followed. You expressed feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>disconnection from yourself</sym>, along with <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Sleep problems, memory issues, and physical tension are also part of your experience, and you've indicated recent <sym>substance use</sym> as a way of coping. It\u2019s clear you are going through a very challenging time, and your openness is important as it helps in understanding your needs.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>psychotic features</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoid ideation</sym>, and feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> suggest a psychotic component, which can occur in severe depression with psychotic features. The episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, along with symptoms such as feeling on edge, physiological arousal, and avoidance behaviors, support a concurrent diagnosis of <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient's recent <sym>substance use</sym> may be a maladaptive attempt to self-manage distress but can also exacerbate symptoms. Overall, the combination of mood, psychotic, anxiety, and substance use features points toward a complex presentation that requires integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess risk for harm, and explore trauma history if present.<br>\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, including close monitoring and support systems.<br>\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, and evaluate the need for antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms persist.<br>\n4. Refer for psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms.<br>\n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized substance use treatment if appropriate.<br>\n6. Monitor sleep and implement strategies for improving sleep hygiene, possibly including medication management.<br>\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to assess symptom progression, medication adherence, and safety.",

The symptomatic profile suggests a high level of emotional distress with potential risk for self-harm. The presence of auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and derealization warrants comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including assessment for mood disorder with psychotic features, psychosis spectrum disorders, or trauma-related pathology. The patient's substance use and recent self-injurious thoughts highlight the need for immediate safety planning and integrated treatment addressing mood, psychosis, substance use, and possible underlying trauma.",

You mentioned feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You also described heightened <sym>anxiety</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, including physical sensations like difficulty breathing and feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, you reported experiencing <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>\u2014hearing voices that others do not hear\u2014and paranoid thoughts, such as feeling watched or followed. You expressed feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>disconnection from yourself</sym>, along with <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. Sleep problems, memory issues, and physical tension are also part of your experience, and you've indicated recent <sym>substance use</sym> as a way of coping. It\u2019s clear you are going through a very challenging time, and your openness is important as it helps in understanding your needs.\n\n**Diagnosis:**<br>\n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>psychotic features</med> and <med>panic disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**<br>\nThe patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>paranoid ideation</sym>, and feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> suggest a psychotic component, which can occur in severe depression with psychotic features. The episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, along with symptoms such as feeling on edge, physiological arousal, and avoidance behaviors, support a concurrent diagnosis of <med>panic disorder</med>. The patient's recent <sym>substance use</sym> may be a maladaptive attempt to self-manage distress but can also exacerbate symptoms. Overall, the combination of mood, psychotic, anxiety, and substance use features points toward a complex presentation that requires integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**<br>\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess risk for harm, and explore trauma history if present.<br>\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, including close monitoring and support systems.<br>\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, and evaluate the need for antipsychotic medication if psychotic symptoms persist.<br>\n4. Refer for psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms.<br>\n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized substance use treatment if appropriate.<br>\n6. Monitor sleep and implement strategies for improving sleep hygiene, possibly including medication management.<br>\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to assess symptom progression, medication adherence, and safety.",
