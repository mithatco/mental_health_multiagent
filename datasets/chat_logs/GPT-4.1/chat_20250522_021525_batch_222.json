      "content": "The patient presents with a complex array of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress and psychological challenges. They report persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and impulsivity. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. They also describe episodes of <sym>perceptual disturbances</sym> such as hearing <sym>voices</sym> and feeling that <sym>thoughts are being broadcasted</sym>. Cognitive concerns include <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient admits to <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, suggesting dissociative experiences. Substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and misuse of painkillers, appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism. They also express feelings of <sym>disconnection from themselves</sym> and <sym>loss of purpose</sym>. The overall picture indicates a high level of emotional and psychological strain that warrants careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder with hypomanic and depressive features), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Symptoms, Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Tobacco, Cannabis, and Non-prescribed Painkillers), and possible Psychotic or Psychotic-like Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent depression</sym> with <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> point toward a mood disorder, potentially within the bipolar spectrum given the reports of <sym>increased energy</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym> despite sleep disturbances. The <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, and dissociative episodes suggests psychotic or psychotic-like features, which can occur in mood episodes or as part of a dissociative disorder spectrum. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive behaviors, along with self-reported <sym>distress</sym>, support a diagnosis of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>. The use of substances, including alcohol, marijuana, and misuse of prescription medication, indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the mental health symptoms. Overall, the presentation is complex and points toward a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, dissociative, psychotic-like, and substance use features, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use, to clarify diagnosis and severity.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including immediate risk assessment and monitoring.\n3. Initiate evidence-based psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), tailored to mood stabilization, anxiety management, and dissociative symptoms.\n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antianxiety medications, or antipsychotics, based on comprehensive assessment and diagnosis.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use</med> and its impact on mental health, and offer support for substance reduction or abstinence.\n6. Engage the patient in ongoing monitoring of symptoms, risk factors, and functional impairments, with regular follow-up appointments.\n7. Collaborate with other healthcare providers, including medical professionals, to evaluate and manage any physical health concerns, such as unexplained aches or pains.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with pervasive symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including persistent anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure\"), feelings of depression, hopelessness, and low affect. Elevated irritability and impulsivity are noted, alongside reports of increased energy despite reduced sleep, suggestive of possible hypomanic or mixed features. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by chronic worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and physical sensations such as rapid heartbeat and breathlessness. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory impairment and disorientation in familiar settings, raising questions about possible neurocognitive involvement. Somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and pains, are reported, alongside feelings of dissociation and depersonalization, which may reflect dissociative symptoms or heightened emotional distress.\n\nThe patient admits to recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, consistent with obsessive-compulsive features. Additionally, there are reports of identity disturbance, social withdrawal, and anhedonia, indicating social and interpersonal detachment. Substance use is notable, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits, regular tobacco use, and recent non-prescribed use of painkillers and marijuana, which could exacerbate mood and cognitive symptoms and pose additional health risks.\n\n**Pattern and Clinical Significance:**\n- Symptom overlap of mood dysregulation, anxiety, dissociative experiences, and impulsivity suggests a complex presentation with features of mood disorder (potential bipolar spectrum), anxiety disorder, and dissociative phenomena.\n- The presence of suicidal ideation (though no mention of intent or planning) warrants careful assessment of risk.\n- Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism, potentially complicating clinical management.\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances, including hallucination-like experiences and thought broadcasting, raise concern for psychotic features or severe dissociative states.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Reports of passive suicidal thoughts in the absence of active plans.\n- Usage of substances (marijuana, non-prescribed painkillers) to self-medicate, which may impair judgment and increase risk.\n- Dissociative episodes and perceptual disturbances may signal underlying psychosis or trauma-related pathology.\n- Impulsivity and recent risky behaviors could elevate risk for harm to self or others.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a complex clinical picture characterized by major depressive symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, dissociative experiences, cognitive disturbances, and substance misuse. The constellation of symptoms suggests a potential mood disorder with psychotic and dissociative features, compounded by substance use as a maladaptive coping strategy. Immediate safety assessment regarding suicidality and substance use, alongside comprehensive diagnostic clarification, is indicated to inform targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex array of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress and psychological challenges. They report persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and impulsivity. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. They also describe episodes of <sym>perceptual disturbances</sym> such as hearing <sym>voices</sym> and feeling that <sym>thoughts are being broadcasted</sym>. Cognitive concerns include <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient admits to <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>ritualistic behaviors</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, suggesting dissociative experiences. Substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and misuse of painkillers, appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism. They also express feelings of <sym>disconnection from themselves</sym> and <sym>loss of purpose</sym>. The overall picture indicates a high level of emotional and psychological strain that warrants careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder with hypomanic and depressive features), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Symptoms, Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Tobacco, Cannabis, and Non-prescribed Painkillers), and possible Psychotic or Psychotic-like Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent depression</sym> with <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> point toward a mood disorder, potentially within the bipolar spectrum given the reports of <sym>increased energy</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym> despite sleep disturbances. The <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> align with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, <sym>thought broadcasting</sym>, and dissociative episodes suggests psychotic or psychotic-like features, which can occur in mood episodes or as part of a dissociative disorder spectrum. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive behaviors, along with self-reported <sym>distress</sym>, support a diagnosis of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>. The use of substances, including alcohol, marijuana, and misuse of prescription medication, indicates a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be contributing to or exacerbating the mental health symptoms. Overall, the presentation is complex and points toward a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, dissociative, psychotic-like, and substance use features, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive treatment approach.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use, to clarify diagnosis and severity.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including immediate risk assessment and monitoring.\n3. Initiate evidence-based psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), tailored to mood stabilization, anxiety management, and dissociative symptoms.\n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antianxiety medications, or antipsychotics, based on comprehensive assessment and diagnosis.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use</med> and its impact on mental health, and offer support for substance reduction or abstinence.\n6. Engage the patient in ongoing monitoring of symptoms, risk factors, and functional impairments, with regular follow-up appointments.\n7. Collaborate with other healthcare providers, including medical professionals, to evaluate and manage any physical health concerns, such as unexplained aches or pains.",
