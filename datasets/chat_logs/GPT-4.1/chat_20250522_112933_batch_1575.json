I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a tool used to get a broad overview of different symptoms you might be experiencing across various mental health domains. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time, and I invite you to answer honestly and openly. This will help us better understand your current mental health and guide any further support or treatment you might need. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

There is evidence of affective dysregulation characterized by irritability, heightened anxiety, and panic episodes, alongside sleep disturbances marked by reduced sleep duration and poor sleep quality. The report of psychotic-like experiences, such as auditory hallucinations (whispering voices) and paranoid ideation (belief that others can read thoughts), warrants further assessment for psychotic features. Intrusive, obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors suggest possible obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Additionally, the patient reports cognitive concerns, including memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments, which may reflect underlying neurocognitive or psychiatric processes. Feelings of dissociation and identity questioning could indicate dissociative symptoms or identity disturbance, often associated with trauma-related conditions.\n\nPattern analysis reveals concurrent mood, anxiety, psychotic, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, with notable functional impairment and social withdrawal. The absence of substance misuse or significant risk behaviors, such as substance use or high alcohol intake, is noted.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and dissociative symptoms. The presence of suicidal thoughts, panic episodes, auditory hallucinations, and paranoid experiences highlights the importance of ongoing risk assessment and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits complex symptomatology across mood, anxiety, psychotic, and obsessive-compulsive domains, with notable cognitive and dissociative features. Comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning are recommended to address these multifaceted clinical concerns.",

      "expected": "ocd",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing set of symptoms that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and perceptual challenges. You are experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, with ongoing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that include <sym>panic episodes</sym> and a constant sense that something bad may happen. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and <sym>poor sleep quality</sym>, which may be affecting your overall well-being. You mention hearing <sym>voices</sym> and feeling that others can <sym>read your thoughts</sym>, which are concerning perceptual experiences. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harming others, along with compulsive behaviors like <sym>repeated hand washing</sym> and checking. Additionally, you have difficulties with <sym>memory</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> or disconnection from yourself and your surroundings. The sense of <sym>loneliness</sym> and difficulty connecting with others further impacts your emotional health. Your experiences suggest a multifaceted presentation that warrants careful consideration for several possible diagnoses.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (voices) and paranoid thoughts suggest <med>psychotic features</med>. The chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors meet criteria for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsions, such as <sym>repeated hand washing</sym>, align with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and questions about identity point toward <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>. The combination of mood, psychotic, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms indicates a complex psychiatric presentation requiring integrated management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history and possible neurocognitive testing, to clarify diagnoses and rule out other medical causes.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, including risk assessment and possibly involving crisis intervention services if needed.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants with antipsychotic properties, under psychiatric supervision, tailored to address mood, psychosis, and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Refer for psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and OCD, and trauma-informed therapy to explore dissociative symptoms and identity concerns.  \n5. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral strategies or medication adjustments to improve sleep quality.  \n6. Encourage social support and connection, possibly involving family or support groups, to reduce feelings of isolation.",
