Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. It covers various areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more, to give us a broad picture of your well-being. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this space is safe for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment involves me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer each as openly as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

It\u2019s understandable that feeling <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym> has been overwhelming and has affected your motivation and enjoyment of activities you once valued. The presence of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is concerning and indicates distress that needs careful attention. Your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including persistent worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance of social situations, suggest heightened anxiety symptoms that are impacting your daily life. Additionally, you experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and waking feeling exhausted, along with <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected, which may be related to your mood and anxiety. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> further complicate your experience, indicating significant emotional distress. You report minimal substance use and no current hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, but your overall symptoms point toward a need for comprehensive assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified (possibly generalized anxiety disorder)</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> further support this diagnosis. The presence of persistent worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance of social situations suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>. The intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment are consistent with dissociative symptoms, which can frequently co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders, especially under significant emotional distress. The absence of psychotic features or manic episodes makes <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> less likely. Given the complexity of symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of depression with anxiety and dissociative features is appropriate, pending further assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and explore history of trauma or dissociation. 2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) focused on mood, anxiety, and dissociation. 3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med>, especially if symptoms interfere significantly with functioning or pose safety concerns. 4. Monitor for emergent symptoms, including increased suicidal thoughts or psychosis, and provide safety planning as needed. 5. Refer to a mental health specialist if symptoms persist or worsen, particularly to address dissociative experiences and anxiety management.",

Sleep disturbances are reported as hypersomnia with non-restorative sleep, alongside significant cognitive impairments characterized by concentration difficulties and forgetfulness. Intrusive, distressing thoughts are noted, alongside passive suicidal ideation without current plans, indicating a potential risk factor requiring monitoring. \n\nAdditionally, the patient reports heightened anxiety symptoms, including persistent worry, restlessness, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded situations, suggestive of generalized anxiety features or social anxiety. Somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort are present, potentially related to psychological distress. Experiences of dissociation, such as feelings of detachment and derealization, are documented, which may signal dissociative symptoms or heightened distress.\n\nThe patient denies hallucinations, paranoid ideation, or compulsive behaviors, and reports minimal substance use, with no recent alcohol misuse or tobacco use. No evidence of current substance misuse or impulsivity is observed.\n\nRisk factors of clinical concern include passive suicidal thoughts, significant mood symptoms, and dissociative experiences. The pattern of social withdrawal and anhedonia, combined with sleep and cognitive disturbances, warrants further assessment for depressive and anxiety spectrum disorders.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture indicates a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, somatic, and dissociative symptoms, necessitating comprehensive diagnostic clarification and tailored intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your emotional and physical experiences over the past couple of weeks. It\u2019s understandable that feeling <sym>numb</sym> and <sym>depressed</sym> has been overwhelming and has affected your motivation and enjoyment of activities you once valued. The presence of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is concerning and indicates distress that needs careful attention. Your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, including persistent worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance of social situations, suggest heightened anxiety symptoms that are impacting your daily life. Additionally, you experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as <sym>difficulty falling asleep</sym> and waking feeling exhausted, along with <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like forgetfulness and feeling disconnected, which may be related to your mood and anxiety. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> further complicate your experience, indicating significant emotional distress. You report minimal substance use and no current hallucinations or paranoid thoughts, but your overall symptoms point toward a need for comprehensive assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified (possibly generalized anxiety disorder)</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> further support this diagnosis. The presence of persistent worry, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and avoidance of social situations suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>. The intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment are consistent with dissociative symptoms, which can frequently co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders, especially under significant emotional distress. The absence of psychotic features or manic episodes makes <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> less likely. Given the complexity of symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of depression with anxiety and dissociative features is appropriate, pending further assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** 1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and explore history of trauma or dissociation. 2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) focused on mood, anxiety, and dissociation. 3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressant medication</med>, especially if symptoms interfere significantly with functioning or pose safety concerns. 4. Monitor for emergent symptoms, including increased suicidal thoughts or psychosis, and provide safety planning as needed. 5. Refer to a mental health specialist if symptoms persist or worsen, particularly to address dissociative experiences and anxiety management.",
