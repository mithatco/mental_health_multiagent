Today, I'll be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time. You can answer honestly and openly, and if you're unsure about anything, just let me know. Are you ready to begin?"

You also notice <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and <sym>stomachaches</sym> related to your worries.

The symptom pattern aligns with an anxiety disorder with comorbid mood features, possibly exacerbated by ongoing social isolation and avoidance behaviors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on exposure techniques and cognitive restructuring to address social fears and avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Address sleep issues with sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, sleep-focused interventions or medication.  \n4. Monitor for worsening suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Explore supportive therapy or group therapy options to improve social skills and reduce feelings of isolation.",

The responses indicate persistent feelings of depression, low interest in activities, and anhedonia, suggestive of comorbid depressive features. The patient reports heightened anxiety, including anticipatory panic symptoms, restlessness, sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, and intrusive negative thoughts about social situations. There are also reports of emotional numbing or dissociation, as well as feelings of confusion regarding personal identity and interpersonal relationships, which may indicate underlying affective or dissociative processes.\n\nPattern analysis reveals chronic social avoidance and heightened social fears, with associated physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches linked to anxiety. The presence of fleeting self-harm thoughts warrants careful monitoring but no current intent or planning is evident. The patient's substance use appears minimal, with no significant use of alcohol or tobacco, and no evidence of substance misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include social anxiety disorder, comorbid depression, sleep disturbance, and possible dissociative symptoms. The patient displays risk factors for worsening mental health, such as ongoing social avoidance, feelings of hopelessness, and transient self-harm thoughts. No immediate risk of harm or substance misuse is identified at this time.\n\nOverall, the clinical profile underscores significant social anxiety with associated mood and sleep disturbances, requiring comprehensive assessment and targeted interventions to address these interconnected issues.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience persistent feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>fear of social judgment</sym> that lead you to avoid social situations, such as parties and meetings. You often feel <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, especially when thinking about your ability to manage social interactions. You also notice <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>, and <sym>stomachaches</sym> related to your worries. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and waking up feeling anxious, are common, and intrusive negative thoughts about social scenarios frequently enter your mind. You sometimes experience fleeting <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, though you do not intend to act on them. Overall, your responses indicate significant distress related to social fears, mood symptoms, and sleep disturbances, which profoundly impact your daily life and emotional well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> and associated sleep disturbance.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's core symptoms of <sym>intense fear and avoidance of social situations</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>panic-like feelings</sym> and <sym>restlessness</sym> strongly suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The pervasive feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> point toward a concurrent <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The sleep difficulties, characterized by trouble initiating sleep and feeling anxious upon waking, further support this diagnosis. The transient <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> are important to monitor but do not appear to be indicative of active suicidal intent at this time. The symptom pattern aligns with an anxiety disorder with comorbid mood features, possibly exacerbated by ongoing social isolation and avoidance behaviors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on exposure techniques and cognitive restructuring to address social fears and avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.  \n3. Address sleep issues with sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, sleep-focused interventions or medication.  \n4. Monitor for worsening suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Explore supportive therapy or group therapy options to improve social skills and reduce feelings of isolation.",
