We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health, including mood, anxiety, and other symptoms, to better tailor any support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest and open. The assessment involves 23 questions about your experiences over the past two weeks. I will ask each question one at a time, and you can answer in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019re feeling <sym>depressed</sym> with persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>disconnection from activities you once enjoyed</sym>. You\u2019ve also described feeling <sym>anxious, worried, and on edge</sym>, with occasional <sym>panic episodes</sym> that can be overwhelming. Your thoughts include <sym>intrusive concerns about contamination and harm</sym>, accompanied by <sym>compulsive rituals like hand-washing and checking</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve noticed <sym>dissociative feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, along with sleep difficulties, memory issues, and some physical aches that may be related to stress. You\u2019ve also expressed <sym>distress over self-harm thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>isolation from loved ones</sym>. Managing these symptoms is understandably challenging, and your awareness of these issues is an important first step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (possibly OCD or related disorder), with dissociative experiences and sleep disturbance.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of symptoms such as feeling <sym>on edge, worried, and experiencing panic attacks</sym> suggests significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive rituals like repeated hand-washing and checking, indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>, which may meet criteria for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> or related disorder. The dissociative feelings of detachment from self and surroundings fit with dissociative experiences that can accompany severe anxiety or mood symptoms. The reported <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are a warning sign that requires urgent attention. Sleep problems and cognitive issues further impair functioning, reinforcing the severity of the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment, especially regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotropic medication</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n3. Recommend <sym>psychotherapy</sym>, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.\n4. Explore interventions for <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and improve grounding techniques.\n5. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education, and consider a sleep assessment if problems persist.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> and related symptoms, and develop coping strategies.\n7. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting plans as needed.",

There is an active risk factor related to suicidal ideation. The pattern of symptoms suggests a need for comprehensive evaluation to determine diagnoses such as Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and possible dissociative features. Immediate safety assessment and development of a tailored treatment plan, potentially including psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, are indicated.",

You\u2019re feeling <sym>depressed</sym> with persistent <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>disconnection from activities you once enjoyed</sym>. You\u2019ve also described feeling <sym>anxious, worried, and on edge</sym>, with occasional <sym>panic episodes</sym> that can be overwhelming. Your thoughts include <sym>intrusive concerns about contamination and harm</sym>, accompanied by <sym>compulsive rituals like hand-washing and checking</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve noticed <sym>dissociative feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings</sym>, along with sleep difficulties, memory issues, and some physical aches that may be related to stress. You\u2019ve also expressed <sym>distress over self-harm thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>isolation from loved ones</sym>. Managing these symptoms is understandably challenging, and your awareness of these issues is an important first step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> (possibly OCD or related disorder), with dissociative experiences and sleep disturbance.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of symptoms such as feeling <sym>on edge, worried, and experiencing panic attacks</sym> suggests significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive rituals like repeated hand-washing and checking, indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>, which may meet criteria for <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> or related disorder. The dissociative feelings of detachment from self and surroundings fit with dissociative experiences that can accompany severe anxiety or mood symptoms. The reported <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are a warning sign that requires urgent attention. Sleep problems and cognitive issues further impair functioning, reinforcing the severity of the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment, especially regarding <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n2. Initiate or adjust <med>psychotropic medication</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, in collaboration with a psychiatrist.\n3. Recommend <sym>psychotherapy</sym>, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.\n4. Explore interventions for <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and improve grounding techniques.\n5. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education, and consider a sleep assessment if problems persist.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> and related symptoms, and develop coping strategies.\n7. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting plans as needed.",
