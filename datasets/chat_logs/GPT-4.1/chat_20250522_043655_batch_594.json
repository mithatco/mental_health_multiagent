Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms you may be experiencing. This assessment is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you to share honestly. We will go through 23 questions together, one at a time. There are no right or wrong answers; I just want to understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

It\u2019s evident that you\u2019ve been struggling with persistent <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. At the same time, you describe episodes of <sym>mood elevation</sym> characterized by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. You also experience <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as excessive worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and social avoidance. Additionally, you report <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including irregular sleep patterns, and some somatic complaints like headaches and muscle aches. While you have thoughts of <sym>death</sym>, you do not express suicidal intent, but these thoughts are concerning and warrant ongoing attention. Your withdrawal from relationships and feelings of dissociation further highlight the emotional strain you are under. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history indicates episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> alongside <sym>periods of elevated or irritable mood</sym>, increased <sym>energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and risky behaviors, which are characteristic of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (worry, feeling on edge), and sleep disturbances during both low and high states supports a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder with mixed features, where symptoms of depression and mania/hypomania co-occur or fluctuate rapidly. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature of the mood symptoms further align with a bipolar diagnosis rather than a primary mood disorder like major depressive disorder. The somatic complaints and anxiety symptoms may be secondary to mood dysregulation but do not meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The thoughts of <sym>death</sym> are passive and do not indicate active suicidal intent, but they should be monitored.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history of mood episodes, family history, and any previous diagnoses or treatments.\n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including medications such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, under psychiatric supervision.\n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help you understand your mood patterns and triggers.\n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to develop coping skills and manage symptoms.\n5. Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, especially given the passive death thoughts, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n6. Address anxiety symptoms with appropriate therapeutic interventions or pharmacotherapy, if indicated.\n7. Encourage regular sleep routines and stress management techniques to stabilize mood and improve overall well-being.\n8. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and make adjustments as necessary.",

The reported hypoactive and hyperactive states suggest significant mood instability, potentially consistent with bipolar spectrum features. The patient also reports notable anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry, feelings of being on edge, and social avoidance, alongside somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle aches, which may have psychosomatic components.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are minimal, with no evidence of psychotic phenomena, but there are reports of dissociative feelings and brief passive death thoughts without active suicidal intent. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with variability in sleep duration impacting overall rest quality. There is also evidence of cognitive concerns, such as forgetfulness and disorientation during depressive episodes.\n\nBehaviorally, the patient exhibits social withdrawal, self-reported impulsivity during high phases, and alcohol use aligned with mood states. No tobacco or medication misuse is noted.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive death ideation, impulsive and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes, and alcohol use potentially serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. While active suicidal intent appears absent, the presence of death thoughts warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates significant mood symptoms with episodic mood elevation and depression, coupled with anxiety and somatic complaints, indicating a complex mood disorder possibly involving bipolar features. Further assessment, including a detailed clinical interview and collateral information, is recommended to refine diagnosis and inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your emotional and physical experiences over the past two weeks. It\u2019s evident that you\u2019ve been struggling with persistent <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. At the same time, you describe episodes of <sym>mood elevation</sym> characterized by <sym>increased energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>. You also experience <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> such as excessive worry, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and social avoidance. Additionally, you report <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including irregular sleep patterns, and some somatic complaints like headaches and muscle aches. While you have thoughts of <sym>death</sym>, you do not express suicidal intent, but these thoughts are concerning and warrant ongoing attention. Your withdrawal from relationships and feelings of dissociation further highlight the emotional strain you are under. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate severity, with mixed features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history indicates episodes of <sym>depressed mood</sym> alongside <sym>periods of elevated or irritable mood</sym>, increased <sym>energy</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and risky behaviors, which are characteristic of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (worry, feeling on edge), and sleep disturbances during both low and high states supports a diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder with mixed features, where symptoms of depression and mania/hypomania co-occur or fluctuate rapidly. The absence of psychotic features and the episodic nature of the mood symptoms further align with a bipolar diagnosis rather than a primary mood disorder like major depressive disorder. The somatic complaints and anxiety symptoms may be secondary to mood dysregulation but do not meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The thoughts of <sym>death</sym> are passive and do not indicate active suicidal intent, but they should be monitored.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history of mood episodes, family history, and any previous diagnoses or treatments.\n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including medications such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, under psychiatric supervision.\n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> to help you understand your mood patterns and triggers.\n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to develop coping skills and manage symptoms.\n5. Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors, especially given the passive death thoughts, and develop a safety plan if needed.\n6. Address anxiety symptoms with appropriate therapeutic interventions or pharmacotherapy, if indicated.\n7. Encourage regular sleep routines and stress management techniques to stabilize mood and improve overall well-being.\n8. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and make adjustments as necessary.",
