Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to get an overall picture of your mental health over the past two weeks and will include questions about different areas like mood, anxiety, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves me asking you 23 different questions, one at a time. You can answer honestly and openly, and if you have any questions about the process, feel free to ask. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>difficulty staying asleep and feeling exhausted during the day</sym>. You've also been feeling <sym>more irritable and easily annoyed</sym>. Anxiety has been a significant concern, as you've reported <sym>frequent feelings of worry about panic attacks, avoiding certain situations, and feeling on edge</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and muscle tension</sym> are present, and intrusive <sym>thoughts about losing control or having panic episodes</sym> have been recurrent. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself at times</sym> and feeling <sym>lost about your identity and future</sym>. Social withdrawal and distancing from friends and family are also impacting your well-being. You\u2019ve acknowledged <quote>thoughts about self-harm</quote>, which is important to monitor carefully. Overall, your experience reflects a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and dissociative feelings, which are significantly affecting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, physical manifestations of anxiety such as muscle tension and headaches, avoidance behaviors, and panic attacks</sym> aligns with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>disconnection, feelings of detachment, and a sense of being outside of oneself</sym> suggest dissociative experiences often seen with high anxiety and mood disturbances. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further support this clinical picture. Given the combination of mood, anxiety, somatic, and dissociative symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>GAD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> is appropriate. This assessment remains provisional pending further evaluation and risk assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation and risk of self-harm</sym> and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacologic treatment, considering antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) and possibly medications targeting anxiety and panic symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <sym>depressive symptoms, anxiety, panic attacks, and dissociative experiences</sym>.  \n4. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider a sleep assessment to address ongoing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, including coping strategies and stress management techniques.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",

Concurrently, there are notable signs of generalized anxiety disorder and panic symptoms, evidenced by excessive worry about panic attacks, avoidance behaviors in response to fears of losing control, and physical manifestations such as muscle tension, headaches, and sleep disturbances. The patient reports hypnagogic and sleep fragmentation issues, with difficulty maintaining restorative sleep. Intrusive thoughts related to panic episodes and feelings of dissociation (\"feeling detached\" and \"outside of myself\") further complicate the clinical picture, suggesting possible comorbid anxiety and dissociative experiences.\n\nPatterns observed include a consistent presence of mood disturbance coupled with heightened anxiety and panic symptoms, alongside somatic complaints without medical etiology. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished engagement with relationships suggest significant functional impairment. The mention of thoughts of self-harm, although not active ideation, indicates elevated risk that warrants monitoring.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative symptoms. The patient's reports of feeling lost and disconnected may also warrant exploration of underlying identity or existential concerns. Risk factors include current hopelessness, passive suicidal thoughts, and avoidance behaviors, which necessitate careful assessment and safety planning.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood disorder features, high levels of anxiety and panic, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences, with associated functional impairment and potential risk factors requiring ongoing evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical symptoms. You've described persistent <sym>feelings of hopelessness and sadness</sym>, along with a sense of <sym>numbness and lack of interest in activities</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>difficulty staying asleep and feeling exhausted during the day</sym>. You've also been feeling <sym>more irritable and easily annoyed</sym>. Anxiety has been a significant concern, as you've reported <sym>frequent feelings of worry about panic attacks, avoiding certain situations, and feeling on edge</sym>. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and muscle tension</sym> are present, and intrusive <sym>thoughts about losing control or having panic episodes</sym> have been recurrent. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself at times</sym> and feeling <sym>lost about your identity and future</sym>. Social withdrawal and distancing from friends and family are also impacting your well-being. You\u2019ve acknowledged <quote>thoughts about self-harm</quote>, which is important to monitor carefully. Overall, your experience reflects a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and dissociative feelings, which are significantly affecting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, physical manifestations of anxiety such as muscle tension and headaches, avoidance behaviors, and panic attacks</sym> aligns with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>disconnection, feelings of detachment, and a sense of being outside of oneself</sym> suggest dissociative experiences often seen with high anxiety and mood disturbances. The sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further support this clinical picture. Given the combination of mood, anxiety, somatic, and dissociative symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>GAD</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> is appropriate. This assessment remains provisional pending further evaluation and risk assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation and risk of self-harm</sym> and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacologic treatment, considering antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) and possibly medications targeting anxiety and panic symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <sym>depressive symptoms, anxiety, panic attacks, and dissociative experiences</sym>.  \n4. Explore sleep hygiene strategies and consider a sleep assessment to address ongoing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, including coping strategies and stress management techniques.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.",
