I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different domains. This is a confidential process, and our goal is to create a safe space where you can share honestly, and I can better understand your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering mood, anxiety, social concerns, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I would appreciate your honest responses. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and overthinking, are also affecting you, and you sometimes feel <sym>detached</sym> or <sym>dissociated</sym>, especially when overwhelmed. Your feelings of disconnection, uncertainty about your identity, and difficulty forming close relationships contribute to your sense of isolation. Despite these challenges, you do not report thoughts of self-harm or substance misuse, which is reassuring.

The reported <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and sleep problems indicate comorbid <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The experiences of <sym>detachment</sym> and feeling outside oneself are characteristic of <med>dissociative experiences</med>, often associated with heightened anxiety. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation suggests that the core issues are rooted in anxiety and mood disturbances rather than psychosis or somatic symptom disorder. The overall presentation points toward a primary diagnosis of social anxiety with secondary mood and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety, focusing on exposure, cognitive restructuring, and social skills training.\n2. Consider a comprehensive assessment for <med>major depressive disorder</med> and evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, consider a referral to a sleep specialist.\n4. Explore techniques for managing <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and anxiety, such as mindfulness or grounding exercises.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression to foster understanding and reduce stigma.\n6.

The reported persistent low interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and pervasive anxiety\u2014including feelings of being on edge and experiencing panic-like episodes\u2014suggest comorbid features of depressive and anxious symptomatology. Sleep disturbances, notably difficulty initiating sleep and ruminative overthinking, are also evident, potentially contributing to overall functional impairment. The presence of dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached or outside oneself, indicates transient dissociative symptoms associated with heightened anxiety or stress responses.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal a consistent focus on social fears, avoidance behaviors, and negative ruminations, with minimal indications of psychotic or substance use issues. No immediate suicidal or self-harm risk factors are evident, as the patient denies suicidal thoughts; however, the chronicity of hopelessness and social withdrawal warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include social anxiety disorder, comorbid dysthymic or depressive features, and dissociative symptoms. The patient's subjective experiences of disconnection, social avoidance, and anxious arousal are relevant to diagnosis and treatment planning. No current substance misuse or risk behaviors are identified, but the pervasive distress and functional impairment suggest a need for comprehensive intervention.\n\nIn summary, the patient presents with significant social anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, and dissociative experiences, all of which merit further clinical assessment and targeted therapeutic strategies.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience significant <sym>social anxiety</sym>, which leads you to avoid social situations due to fears of judgment and discomfort. You mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> at times, particularly related to your social struggles, and have noted increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social contexts. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and overthinking, are also affecting you, and you sometimes feel <sym>detached</sym> or <sym>dissociated</sym>, especially when overwhelmed. Your feelings of disconnection, uncertainty about your identity, and difficulty forming close relationships contribute to your sense of isolation. Despite these challenges, you do not report thoughts of self-harm or substance misuse, which is reassuring. Overall, your experiences reflect a complex interplay of social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and dissociative feelings, all of which are impacting your emotional well-being and functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (Social Phobia) with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and transient <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's consistent avoidance of social situations, pervasive fears of judgment, and difficulties with social relationships strongly suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and sleep problems indicate comorbid <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The experiences of <sym>detachment</sym> and feeling outside oneself are characteristic of <med>dissociative experiences</med>, often associated with heightened anxiety. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation suggests that the core issues are rooted in anxiety and mood disturbances rather than psychosis or somatic symptom disorder. The overall presentation points toward a primary diagnosis of social anxiety with secondary mood and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting social anxiety, focusing on exposure, cognitive restructuring, and social skills training.\n2. Consider a comprehensive assessment for <med>major depressive disorder</med> and evaluate the potential benefit of pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, consider a referral to a sleep specialist.\n4. Explore techniques for managing <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and anxiety, such as mindfulness or grounding exercises.\n5. Provide psychoeducation about social anxiety and depression to foster understanding and reduce stigma.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor progress, adjust treatment plans, and assess for any emerging concerns.",
