This assessment is designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering mood, anxiety, sleep, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one step-by-step.

The symptoms are persistent, impairing functioning, and reflect a mood disorder with significant anxiety components, consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Features</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, especially regarding suicidal ideation.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) and psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).\n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication, while monitoring for improvement.\n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or counselor for trauma-informed therapy focusing on depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n5. Regularly monitor mood, anxiety levels, and suicidal thoughts, adjusting treatment as needed to ensure safety and symptom reduction.",

Key features include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, hypersomnia (noted as early awakening and inability to return to sleep), cognitive impairment (evidenced by memory difficulties and disorientation), and feelings of detachment or dissociation. The patient reports persistent negative ruminative thoughts about self and the future, alongside feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by excessive worry, physical sensations of panic (heart racing, shortness of breath), and avoidance behaviors. There are somatic complaints including headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort, with the perception that these symptoms are not adequately validated by healthcare providers. \n\nPatterns suggest a chronic mood disturbance with elements of anxiety, somatic preoccupations, and dissociative experiences. The patient's social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities further support a depressive syndrome. Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation without current plans, recent social isolation, and self-reported feelings of being lost or disconnected from identity and purpose. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse is noted, although the presence of panic attacks and dissociative phenomena warrants further assessment.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation is consistent with moderate to severe depression compounded by anxiety and somatic complaints, with potential dissociative features. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation, further evaluation of mood and anxiety severity, and exploration of dissociative experiences are recommended for comprehensive clinical management.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex array of symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress and mental health challenges. They report persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, with a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>worthlessness</sym>. Sleep disturbances, including early awakening and difficulty returning to sleep, contribute to fatigue and cognitive difficulties, such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation. The patient also describes feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>\u2014like being outside their own experience\u2014and reports <sym>persistent negative thoughts</sym> about themselves and the future. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>muscle aches</sym>, and stomach pain are present, along with feelings that their symptoms are not always believed or understood by healthcare providers. The social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities further indicate a profound depressive state, with some passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> without active intent. Overall, these symptoms suggest a severe mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and somatic complaints, requiring careful clinical attention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which meets criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> supports a severe classification. Anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>excessive worry</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, are prominent and indicate <med>Anxious Distress</med> features, which can complicate the clinical picture but are often seen in severe depression. Dissociative experiences and somatic complaints further suggest complex symptomatology, but without evidence of psychosis or substance misuse. The symptoms are persistent, impairing functioning, and reflect a mood disorder with significant anxiety components, consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Features</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, especially regarding suicidal ideation.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) and psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy).\n3. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication, while monitoring for improvement.\n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a psychologist or counselor for trauma-informed therapy focusing on depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n5. Regularly monitor mood, anxiety levels, and suicidal thoughts, adjusting treatment as needed to ensure safety and symptom reduction.",
