Anxiety symptoms such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>worrying</sym> excessively, experiencing <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and avoiding certain situations are also prominent. Additionally, you mentioned <sym>somatic complaints</sym> including unexplained aches and tension, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and identity confusion. You have experienced <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive episodes and occasional substance use, including alcohol and cigarettes, often as coping mechanisms. Your experiences of feeling dismissed by healthcare providers and feeling disconnected from loved ones highlight some challenges in seeking support.

The suicidal thoughts during depressive states further support a mood disorder diagnosis. The combination of mood instability, anxiety features, and somatic complaints suggests a complex presentation requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and explore history of mood episodes, anxiety, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including <med>mood stabilizers</med> (e.g., lithium, valproate) and consider <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and, if necessary, referral to substance use treatment programs.  \n4. Monitor for suicidality regularly, especially during depressive episodes, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Explore management of somatic complaints through collaboration with medical providers and consider stress reduction techniques or somatic therapies as adjuncts.",

During hypomanic states, the patient reports decreased sleep, heightened goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors, including impulsive purchasing and project initiation.\n\nAnxiety features are notable, with reports of pervasive worry, feeling on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors in response to heightened anxiety. Somatic complaints, such as unexplained aches and tension-related pains, are also present, coupled with concerns about being dismissed by healthcare providers, indicating possible validation issues.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances include transient dissociative experiences (feeling detached or outside oneself) and intrusive thoughts, with no evidence of hallucinations or delusional thinking. The patient reports occasional suicidal ideation during depressive episodes but denies active intent or plans.\n\nSubstance use behaviors include alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion and cigarette smoking, often used as coping mechanisms for stress and mood symptoms. There is also a history of non-prescribed medication use, with self-administration of prescription drugs beyond prescribed limits.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include recurrent suicidal ideation, impulsivity during hypomanic episodes, substance misuse, and feelings of disconnection or identity confusion. The patient's presentation suggests a mood disorder with features consistent with bipolar spectrum pathology, compounded by comorbid anxiety and somatic concerns.\n\nOverall, the symptomatology warrants comprehensive mood disorder assessment, vigilant monitoring for suicidality, and evaluation of substance use impact. The patient's history of self-harm thoughts, impulsivity, and substance misuse underscores the need for a safety-focused, integrated treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health, characterized by significant mood swings, including episodes of <sym>depression</sym> with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, loss of interest, and intrusive negative thoughts. You also described periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym> and <sym>high energy</sym>, during which you experience decreased <med>sleep</med>, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors like impulsive spending and starting multiple projects. Anxiety symptoms such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>worrying</sym> excessively, experiencing <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and avoiding certain situations are also prominent. Additionally, you mentioned <sym>somatic complaints</sym> including unexplained aches and tension, along with feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and identity confusion. You have experienced <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> during depressive episodes and occasional substance use, including alcohol and cigarettes, often as coping mechanisms. Your experiences of feeling dismissed by healthcare providers and feeling disconnected from loved ones highlight some challenges in seeking support. Overall, your symptoms suggest a mood disorder with episodic bipolar features, combined with anxiety and somatic concerns, requiring careful assessment and management.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Simplified Somatic Symptom Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's history of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and thoughts of self-harm, combined with episodic <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> such as decreased <med>sleep</med>, increased energy, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, aligns with <med>Bipolar II Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicates significant <med>Anxiety Symptoms</med>. The reports of <sym>unexplained aches</sym> and feeling <sym>detached</sym> may reflect somatic manifestations often seen in mood and anxiety disorders but do not meet criteria for primary <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The suicidal thoughts during depressive states further support a mood disorder diagnosis. The combination of mood instability, anxiety features, and somatic complaints suggests a complex presentation requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and explore history of mood episodes, anxiety, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate mood stabilization treatment, potentially including <med>mood stabilizers</med> (e.g., lithium, valproate) and consider <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Address substance use by providing psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and, if necessary, referral to substance use treatment programs.  \n4. Monitor for suicidality regularly, especially during depressive episodes, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Explore management of somatic complaints through collaboration with medical providers and consider stress reduction techniques or somatic therapies as adjuncts.",
