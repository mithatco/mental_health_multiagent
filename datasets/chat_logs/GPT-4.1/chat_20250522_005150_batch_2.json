Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. I will ask you 23 questions, one at a time, and you can answer honestly in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You also experience ongoing <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and a tendency to <sym>avoid situations</sym> that increase your anxiety. Sleep difficulties, such as waking up frequently and feeling restless, are contributing to your overall distress, and you\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is very concerning. Your reports of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication\u2014further complicate your situation. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, and it\u2019s important that you know you\u2019re not alone and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with anxious distress; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; and Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol and Nicotine dependence), with active suicidal ideation. Additionally, features of dissociation are present, which may suggest dissociative symptoms or a dissociative component related to your distress.**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low energy</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates high risk, requiring immediate attention. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues (memory problems), and dissociative experiences suggest a complex presentation with possible dissociative features. The ongoing substance use of alcohol and cigarettes, along with self-medication, raises concerns about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which can exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The combination of these symptoms and risks warrants a comprehensive, integrated approach to treatment and safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with immediate safety planning if needed.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and develop an individualized treatment plan, including consideration of medication management for depression and anxiety.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>coping skills</sym>.  \n4. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through specialized addiction services or integrated treatment programs.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and the impact of <sym>substance use</sym> on mental health.  \n6. Consider a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",

There are also indications of significant anxiety features, evidenced by chronic worry (\"worry about everything,\" \"feeling tense\"), panic episodes (\"waves of panic,\" \"lose control\"), avoidance behaviors (\"staying home to avoid anxiety\"), and sleep disturbances (difficulty sleeping, restless nights). The patient reports cognitive concerns such as memory impairment (\"forget things more often\") and derealization or depersonalization (\"feeling disconnected,\" \"watching myself from outside\"), which may suggest dissociative symptoms or high distress levels.\n\nThe patient acknowledges experiencing intrusive negative thoughts and urges related to self-harm (\"thoughts about ending it all\"), raising notable suicide risk concerns. Substance use appears problematic, with regular alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, daily cigarette use, and self-managed use of medications without medical oversight, which increases risk for substance dependence and overdose.\n\nPatterns indicate a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety features, substantial functional impairment, and potential dissociative symptoms. The report of suicidal ideation and substance misuse emphasizes the need for immediate safety assessment and a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Potential clinical areas of significance include:**\n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and low energy\n- Anxiety severity and panic symptoms\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment\n- Dissociative experiences\n- Substance use disorder risk\n- Suicidal ideation and self-harm risk\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**\n- Suicidal thoughts, including passive ideation of ending life\n- Substance misuse for self-medication\n- Emotional lability and irritability\n- Dissociative symptoms\n- Self-medication with non-prescribed medications\n- Chronic sleep disturbance\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient's presentation is characterized by severe depressive symptoms, significant anxiety, dissociative experiences, and substance misuse, compounded by active suicidal ideation. These findings warrant urgent clinical intervention, comprehensive safety assessment, and integrated mental health and substance use treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and complex experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a significant amount of emotional pain and distress. You\u2019ve described persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with intense <sym>depression</sym>. You also experience ongoing <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and a tendency to <sym>avoid situations</sym> that increase your anxiety. Sleep difficulties, such as waking up frequently and feeling restless, are contributing to your overall distress, and you\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is very concerning. Your reports of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication\u2014further complicate your situation. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, and it\u2019s important that you know you\u2019re not alone and that help is available.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe, with anxious distress; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; and Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol and Nicotine dependence), with active suicidal ideation. Additionally, features of dissociation are present, which may suggest dissociative symptoms or a dissociative component related to your distress.**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>low energy</sym> consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and feelings of being on edge align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates high risk, requiring immediate attention. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues (memory problems), and dissociative experiences suggest a complex presentation with possible dissociative features. The ongoing substance use of alcohol and cigarettes, along with self-medication, raises concerns about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which can exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The combination of these symptoms and risks warrants a comprehensive, integrated approach to treatment and safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment, including a risk evaluation for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym>, with immediate safety planning if needed.  \n2. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and develop an individualized treatment plan, including consideration of medication management for depression and anxiety.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>coping skills</sym>.  \n4. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through specialized addiction services or integrated treatment programs.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and the impact of <sym>substance use</sym> on mental health.  \n6. Consider a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety.",
