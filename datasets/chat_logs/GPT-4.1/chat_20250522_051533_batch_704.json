Alongside these, you experience significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <quote>feeling nervous or on edge</quote>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <quote>avoiding social situations</quote> due to fear of embarrassment. You also mentioned sleep difficulties, like <quote>trouble sleeping and waking up tired</quote>, along with cognitive concerns such as <quote>forgetfulness and feeling lost even in familiar places</quote>. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, like <quote>feeling disconnected from yourself or your surroundings</quote>. Your experiences of loneliness and social withdrawal, combined with intrusive thoughts, suggest you are going through a challenging period that impacts many areas of your life. It is understandable to feel overwhelmed, and seeking support is a positive step toward understanding and managing these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by the presence of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and sleep disturbances over the past two weeks, as well as reports of feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. The significant anxiety symptoms, including <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and persistent worry, point toward a comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as <quote>feeling disconnected from self and surroundings</quote>, further suggest dissociative features that can occur with severe anxiety or mood disorders. The combination of mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative symptoms indicates a complex presentation that warrants a comprehensive approach. No evidence of psychosis or active suicidal ideation was identified at this time, but ongoing assessment is essential.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any other comorbid conditions.\n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and social fears.\n3. Explore pharmacological options, including antidepressants, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Develop a safety plan and establish regular monitoring for mood stability, especially given the severity of symptoms.\n5. Incorporate psychoeducation about sleep hygiene and strategies to manage intrusive thoughts and dissociative feelings.\n6. Encourage engagement in gradual social activities to reduce avoidance behaviors, supported by social skills training if indicated.\n7. Consider referral to a specialist in trauma or dissociative disorders if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient reports experiencing pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, indicative of depressive symptomatology. They also endorse significant anxiety features, including persistent nervousness, social avoidance, and panic attacks specifically related to social situations, suggesting social anxiety disorder components. Additionally, there is evidence of heightened irritability and mood lability, which may point toward mood dysregulation. Sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining restful sleep, coupled with fatigue, are present. Cognitive concerns are noted through reports of forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments, raising considerations for attentional or memory impairments. The patient describes dissociative experiences such as feeling detached from self and surroundings, which could be indicative of dissociative symptoms or heightened anxiety states.\n\nPattern analysis reveals co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal. Intrusive negative thoughts about past embarrassments and social fears are prominent, aligning with ruminative and obsessive tendencies. Importantly, there are no indications of psychotic symptoms or active suicidal ideation at this time.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and dissociative experiences. The presence of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors warrants further exploration of anxiety-related diagnoses. The cognitive and sleep disturbances merit assessment for possible underlying or comorbid conditions.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include reports of feeling overwhelmed, dissociative experiences, and social avoidance, which could impair functioning. Although no current suicidal ideation is reported, ongoing monitoring is advised given the severity of mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\nOverall, the symptom profile suggests a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features requiring comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing experience characterized by persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in activities</quote>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <quote>feeling pretty down quite a bit</quote>. Alongside these, you experience significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <quote>feeling nervous or on edge</quote>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <quote>avoiding social situations</quote> due to fear of embarrassment. You also mentioned sleep difficulties, like <quote>trouble sleeping and waking up tired</quote>, along with cognitive concerns such as <quote>forgetfulness and feeling lost even in familiar places</quote>. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, like <quote>feeling disconnected from yourself or your surroundings</quote>. Your experiences of loneliness and social withdrawal, combined with intrusive thoughts, suggest you are going through a challenging period that impacts many areas of your life. It is understandable to feel overwhelmed, and seeking support is a positive step toward understanding and managing these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is supported by the presence of pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and sleep disturbances over the past two weeks, as well as reports of feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. The significant anxiety symptoms, including <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and persistent worry, point toward a comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, such as <quote>feeling disconnected from self and surroundings</quote>, further suggest dissociative features that can occur with severe anxiety or mood disorders. The combination of mood, anxiety, sleep, and dissociative symptoms indicates a complex presentation that warrants a comprehensive approach. No evidence of psychosis or active suicidal ideation was identified at this time, but ongoing assessment is essential.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any other comorbid conditions.\n2. Consider evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and social fears.\n3. Explore pharmacological options, including antidepressants, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.\n4. Develop a safety plan and establish regular monitoring for mood stability, especially given the severity of symptoms.\n5. Incorporate psychoeducation about sleep hygiene and strategies to manage intrusive thoughts and dissociative feelings.\n6. Encourage engagement in gradual social activities to reduce avoidance behaviors, supported by social skills training if indicated.\n7. Consider referral to a specialist in trauma or dissociative disorders if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.",
