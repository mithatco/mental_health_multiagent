Key concerns include anhedonia (lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities), persistent feelings of hopelessness and low mood, and difficulties with sleep characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep. There is evidence of psychomotor agitation or irritability, especially in response to internal stressors, alongside cognitive symptoms such as concentration difficulties and memory lapses.\n\nAnxiety-related symptoms are notable, including pervasive worry, social anxiety with avoidance behaviors, and panic-like episodes. The patient reports physical manifestations associated with anxiety, such as headaches and stomachaches. There is also a sense of dissociation or depersonalization during periods of heightened distress, and ruminative thinking centered around social concerns and self-worth.\n\nBehavioral patterns indicate social withdrawal and avoidance, rather than engagement in risk-taking or impulsivity. Substance use history is negative for alcohol misuse or illicit drugs. No current suicidal ideation or intent is reported, and there are no indications of psychotic symptoms.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood disorder features (likely depression), generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and dissociative experiences. The patient's sleep disturbances, combined with mood and anxiety symptoms, suggest a complex affective and anxiety presentation that warrants further assessment. Risk factors are minimal but include significant functional impairment, social withdrawal, and distress related to social situations.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with notable cognitive and somatic complaints, and avoidance behaviors. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation to guide targeted intervention.",

You've mentioned feeling <sym>disconnected from yourself or your surroundings</sym> during stressful periods and have had <sym>recurrent negative thoughts</sym> about yourself and social situations. While you don't have thoughts of hurting yourself or hearing voices, your symptoms have caused significant distress and social withdrawal, impacting your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the pervasive <sym>anxiety, worry, social avoidance, panic episodes, and physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The absence of psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse points toward a mood and anxiety disorder spectrum rather than a primary psychotic or substance use disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnosis and evaluate severity.\n2. Consider initiating psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood and anxiety management.\n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, based on symptom severity and patient preference.\n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and possibly medical evaluation for sleep issues.\n5. Monitor symptoms regularly and adjust treatment plans accordingly, involving multidisciplinary care if needed.",
