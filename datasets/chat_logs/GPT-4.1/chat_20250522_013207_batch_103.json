You also report frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worries</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that can come unexpectedly. You\u2019ve mentioned hearing <sym>voices</sym> that comment on your actions and worry about your thoughts being broadcasted, which suggests <med>psychotic phenomena</med>. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and feeling unrested, seem severe and are affecting your memory and concentration. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings of being outside yourself and confusion about your identity, along with <sym>intrusive</sym> thoughts and routines that you feel compelled to perform. You\u2019ve also indicated thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and some use of substances and medications, which could increase your risk and require careful attention. Overall, your experiences reflect a high level of psychological distress involving mood, psychotic, dissociative, and anxiety symptoms, and these need comprehensive evaluation and support to ensure your safety and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> that have persisted over the past two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (Q13) and paranoid thoughts (Q14) suggests psychotic features accompanying the mood disorder. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> (Q19, Q20), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q15), and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q17), which further support a diagnosis involving severe mood and psychotic symptoms. The combination of suicidal ideation (Q12) and substance use (Q22, Q23, Q24) underscores the need for urgent intervention and safety planning. While some symptoms could overlap with other disorders, the core features align most closely with a major depressive episode with psychotic features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the risk of harm to self or others.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and ensure close monitoring, possibly including hospitalization if safety is at immediate risk.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants combined with antipsychotic medication, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and psychotic experiences.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems if appropriate.  \n6. Address sleep issues with targeted interventions, including sleep hygiene education or medication if necessary.  \n7. Coordinate with medical providers to evaluate and manage physical health concerns and substance use.",

Key concerns include pervasive depressive symptoms characterized by anhedonia (Q2), feelings of hopelessness (Q3), and emotional numbness or detachment (Q19, Q20). Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggestive of comorbid anxiety pathology. The patient also reports perceptual disturbances, including auditory hallucinations (Q13) and paranoid ideation regarding thought broadcasting (Q14), raising concerns about psychotic features.\n\nSleep disturbance appears severe and chronic, with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, non-restorative sleep, and associated cognitive impairments such as memory lapses (Q16). The presence of recurrent intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like routines (Q17, Q18) may indicate obsessive-compulsive features or related disinhibitory phenomena. Dissociative experiences, including depersonalization or derealization (Q19), are also noted.\n\nSelf-harm ideation (Q12) and substance use behaviors\u2014tobacco use (Q23), alcohol consumption (Q22), and non-prescribed medication or drug use (Q24)\u2014serve as potential risk factors for worsening mental health and require careful assessment of safety.\n\n**Pattern Recognition and Clinical Significance:**\n\n- Mood symptoms consistent with depression, including anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue.\n- Anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry, panic episodes, and avoidance.\n- Psychotic features, notably auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity doubts.\n- Sleep disruption and cognitive difficulties.\n- Self-injurious thoughts and substance use behaviors.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n\n- Presence of suicidal ideation (Q12), signifying acute risk.\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation, indicating possible psychosis.\n- Substance use and non-prescribed medication intake, which may exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and pose safety concerns.\n- Feelings of disconnection and identity confusion, which could impair functioning and safety.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThis individual exhibits complex psychopathology involving mood disturbance, prominent anxiety, psychotic phenomena, dissociation, and significant sleep and cognitive impairments. The combination of suicidal thoughts, perceptual disturbances, and substance use necessitates urgent comprehensive assessment and potentially immediate safety planning. Further diagnostic clarification and interdisciplinary intervention are recommended to address these multifaceted symptoms.",

While it includes psychotic features, it does not specify or strongly align with the core features of schizophrenia, such as persistent delusions, disorganized speech or behavior, and negative symptoms. The profile of schizophrenia typically involves a broader and more persistent pattern of psychosis without the predominant mood symptoms seen here. Therefore, the diagnosis does not explicitly match the expected profile of schizophrenia.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing set of symptoms that indicate significant emotional and perceptual difficulties. You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, which have made activities that once brought you joy feel empty or unimportant. You also report frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worries</sym>, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that can come unexpectedly. You\u2019ve mentioned hearing <sym>voices</sym> that comment on your actions and worry about your thoughts being broadcasted, which suggests <med>psychotic phenomena</med>. Sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep and feeling unrested, seem severe and are affecting your memory and concentration. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings of being outside yourself and confusion about your identity, along with <sym>intrusive</sym> thoughts and routines that you feel compelled to perform. You\u2019ve also indicated thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> and some use of substances and medications, which could increase your risk and require careful attention. Overall, your experiences reflect a high level of psychological distress involving mood, psychotic, dissociative, and anxiety symptoms, and these need comprehensive evaluation and support to ensure your safety and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q3), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q2), and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> that have persisted over the past two weeks, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (Q13) and paranoid thoughts (Q14) suggests psychotic features accompanying the mood disorder. Additionally, the patient reports <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> (Q19, Q20), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q15), and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q17), which further support a diagnosis involving severe mood and psychotic symptoms. The combination of suicidal ideation (Q12) and substance use (Q22, Q23, Q24) underscores the need for urgent intervention and safety planning. While some symptoms could overlap with other disorders, the core features align most closely with a major depressive episode with psychotic features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Arrange for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the risk of harm to self or others.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts and ensure close monitoring, possibly including hospitalization if safety is at immediate risk.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacological treatment, such as antidepressants combined with antipsychotic medication, under psychiatric supervision.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive symptoms, anxiety, and psychotic experiences.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, substance use, and coping strategies, and consider involving family or support systems if appropriate.  \n6. Address sleep issues with targeted interventions, including sleep hygiene education or medication if necessary.  \n7. Coordinate with medical providers to evaluate and manage physical health concerns and substance use.",
