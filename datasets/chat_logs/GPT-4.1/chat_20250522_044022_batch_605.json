You described persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty managing everyday interactions. You also mentioned pervasive <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, accompanied by avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings. Your sleep has been disrupted, with reduced sleep hours and restless nights, leading to fatigue and concentration difficulties. Additionally, you reported <sym>bodily tension</sym> and unexplained <sym>headaches</sym>, along with intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, and compulsive behaviors such as checking and handwashing. You expressed feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, occasional <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and social withdrawal. Notably, you shared <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about not waking up or disappearing, though you have no current plans or intentions to harm yourself. Overall, these symptoms reflect a complex picture of emotional distress, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive features, and dissociative experiences, which appear to be causing considerable distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with anxious distress and features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, combined with sleep disturbances and concentration issues, align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and worry suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, perhaps Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with compulsive checking and washing behaviors, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, possibly indicating dissociative features. While some symptoms overlap with somatic complaints, the primary features appear more consistent with mood, anxiety, and OCD-related disorders rather than somatic symptom disorder. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants monitoring, but no active intent is reported at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as antidepressant medication (e.g., SSRI) combined with psychotherapy, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns related to passive suicidal thoughts; develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.  \n5. Consider referral to a specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.",

They describe significant anxiety symptoms, including pervasive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments. Sleep disturbances characterized by decreased sleep duration and fragmented sleep are evident, alongside reports of fatigue and concentration difficulties. Somatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle tension, with subjective experiences of bodily tension and somatic preoccupations. Intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, compulsive checking and handwashing behaviors, and dissociative experiences suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features. The patient also reports feelings of emotional detachment, identity confusion, and social withdrawal, indicating potential affective and social functioning impairments. No current substance use or psychotic phenomena are reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with evidence of panic attacks and avoidance.\n- Intrusive, distressing obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity-related concerns.\n- Somatic complaints linked to tension and anxiety.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia suggest significant functional impairment.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Presence of passive suicidal ideation (\"wishing I didn't wake up\" or \"disappear\") without active plans, indicating moderate suicide risk.\n- Panic attacks and feelings of hopelessness warrant close monitoring.\n- Intrusive thoughts with compulsive behaviors may suggest underlying OCD features.\n- No current substance use or intent to harm self noted.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis client exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, heightened anxiety with panic features, obsessive-compulsive phenomena, and dissociative experiences. The symptom profile indicates significant emotional distress and functional impairment, with passive suicidal ideation as a potential risk factor. A comprehensive assessment, including further evaluation of mood, anxiety, OCD symptoms, and safety planning, is recommended to inform treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that have significantly affected your well-being. You described persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty managing everyday interactions. You also mentioned pervasive <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, accompanied by avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings. Your sleep has been disrupted, with reduced sleep hours and restless nights, leading to fatigue and concentration difficulties. Additionally, you reported <sym>bodily tension</sym> and unexplained <sym>headaches</sym>, along with intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, and compulsive behaviors such as checking and handwashing. You expressed feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings, occasional <sym>identity confusion</sym>, and social withdrawal. Notably, you shared <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about not waking up or disappearing, though you have no current plans or intentions to harm yourself. Overall, these symptoms reflect a complex picture of emotional distress, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive features, and dissociative experiences, which appear to be causing considerable distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with anxious distress and features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, combined with sleep disturbances and concentration issues, align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and worry suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder, perhaps Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with compulsive checking and washing behaviors, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, possibly indicating dissociative features. While some symptoms overlap with somatic complaints, the primary features appear more consistent with mood, anxiety, and OCD-related disorders rather than somatic symptom disorder. The passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants monitoring, but no active intent is reported at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess suicide risk.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as antidepressant medication (e.g., SSRI) combined with psychotherapy, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms.  \n3. Monitor for safety concerns related to passive suicidal thoughts; develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication as appropriate.  \n5. Consider referral to a specialist if dissociative symptoms persist or worsen.",
