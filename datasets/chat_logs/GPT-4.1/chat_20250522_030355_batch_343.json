Additionally, the patient reports significant anxiety symptoms, including generalized worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggestive of comorbid anxiety pathology. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors related to contamination fears and checking rituals are described in detail (Q17, Q18), indicating presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.\n\nAffective symptoms are compounded by episodes of dissociation or feelings of derealization (Q19), and a sense of emotional disconnection or existential uncertainty (Q20). Social withdrawal and strained interpersonal relationships are noted (Q21). No evidence of psychotic features, self-harm ideation, or substance misuse is detected based on the responses.\n\nPatterns observed include overlapping depressive and anxiety symptoms, with compulsive behaviors serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient's symptom profile suggests significant functional impairment, particularly in sleep, cognition, and social domains.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder features. No immediate risk factors such as suicidality or self-harm are evident from the responses, though ongoing distress warrants close monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood disturbance, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, cognitive impairment, and social withdrawal, necessitating comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning.",
