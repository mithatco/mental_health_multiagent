The presence of sleep disturbances further supports the mood and anxiety diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation:** Conduct a full psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnoses, evaluate safety regarding thoughts of self-harm, and explore history of symptoms.  \n2. **Safety Planning:** Develop a plan to ensure safety given the reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, including crisis resources and close monitoring.  \n3. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based therapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.  \n4. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider a psychiatric consultation for potential pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n5. **Address Sleep and Somatic Symptoms:** Incorporate sleep hygiene strategies and explore physical symptoms to rule out medical causes.  \n6. **Support and Psychoeducation:** Provide information about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and support groups if appropriate.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia and social withdrawal, as evidenced by diminished interest in activities and avoidance of social interactions. The patient reports pervasive feelings of depression, hopelessness, and low mood over the past two weeks. Additionally, there is notable anxiety, particularly social anxiety, with frequent feelings of nervousness, fear of social scrutiny, and avoidance of social situations. Physical manifestations such as headaches and stomach aches are present, likely related to stress or anxiety. Sleep disturbances, characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, are reported, contributing to daytime fatigue.\n\nThe patient also exhibits episodes of irritability and emotional lability, with occasional thoughts of self-harm, especially during episodes of overwhelm and hopelessness. There are no reported psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, or perceptual disturbances. The patient denies substance use or compulsive behaviors but admits to feelings of dissociation and identity uncertainty when overwhelmed.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorder.\n- Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal point toward social anxiety features.\n- Sleep disturbance and somatic complaints are consistent with mood and anxiety symptomatology.\n- Presence of passive SI warrants careful monitoring, given the feelings of hopelessness.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation without current plan or intent.\n- Anxiety symptoms, especially panic and avoidance, which may impair functioning.\n- Dissociative experiences and identity questioning, which could indicate underlying emotional dysregulation.\n- No current substance misuse or psychotic features identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient demonstrates a complex presentation characterized by persistent depressive symptoms, significant social anxiety, and related somatic complaints. The co-occurrence of hopelessness and passive SI warrants ongoing risk assessment and safety planning. The clinical profile suggests the need for a comprehensive treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, sleep, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of challenging feelings and experiences over the past two weeks. It sounds like you're struggling with persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym>, <sym>nervous</sym>, and <sym>fearful</sym> in social situations, which leads you to avoid social gatherings. Physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> seem to be connected to your stress and anxiety, and sleep problems are affecting your daily functioning. You're also experiencing some <sym>dissociation</sym> and questions about your <quote>identity</quote>. You\u2019ve acknowledged occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is concerning and requires careful attention. Overall, it appears you're dealing with a complex mix of mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms impacting your well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, primarily Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Anxiety Disorder (likely Social Anxiety Disorder)</med>  \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> over at least two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, especially related to social situations, including <sym>panic</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and <sym>nervousness</sym>, suggest a comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Physical complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> may be somatic manifestations of these mood and anxiety symptoms. The current presentation does not include psychotic features or symptoms indicating a primary psychotic disorder. The patient's reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> and identity questions may be related to emotional distress and anxiety, but do not currently suggest a dissociative disorder. The presence of sleep disturbances further supports the mood and anxiety diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation:** Conduct a full psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnoses, evaluate safety regarding thoughts of self-harm, and explore history of symptoms.  \n2. **Safety Planning:** Develop a plan to ensure safety given the reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, including crisis resources and close monitoring.  \n3. **Psychotherapy:** Initiate evidence-based therapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting both depression and social anxiety symptoms.  \n4. **Medication Evaluation:** Consider a psychiatric consultation for potential pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or do not improve with therapy alone.  \n5. **Address Sleep and Somatic Symptoms:** Incorporate sleep hygiene strategies and explore physical symptoms to rule out medical causes.  \n6. **Support and Psychoeducation:** Provide information about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and support groups if appropriate.",
