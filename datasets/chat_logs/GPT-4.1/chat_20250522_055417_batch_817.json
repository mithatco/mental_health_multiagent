Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health by asking about different symptoms you've experienced over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas such as mood, anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and more. I will ask you each question one by one, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Your worries and <sym>anxiety</sym>, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, seem to be overwhelming at times, and these feelings are accompanied by sleep disturbances, such as difficulty sleeping and feeling unrested. You also described intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, along with <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> like repetitive washing and checking, which suggest obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative</sym> phenomena, such as feeling disconnected from yourself or your surroundings, and some somatic complaints like headaches and muscle tension. You\u2019ve also expressed feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>relationship difficulties</sym>. Importantly, you\u2019ve had some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, though you have not acted on them. Your openness in sharing these experiences demonstrates your willingness to seek help, and I want to acknowledge that these symptoms can be very challenging to cope with.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>, and <med>Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and worry aligns with <med>Anxious Features</med>. The presence of intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with repetitive <sym>behaviors</sym> such as washing and checking, suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. Experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym>, as well as feelings of emotional <sym>dissociation</sym>, indicate <med>Dissociative Features</med>. Overall, these symptoms co-occur and significantly impair functioning, fitting a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical conditions, especially considering somatic complaints.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), tailored to address depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), focusing on mood management, anxiety reduction, and exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Monitor for safety given the presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Explore additional interventions for dissociative symptoms if they persist or worsen, potentially involving trauma-informed therapy.  \n6. Consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances continue to impact daily functioning.",

Key symptoms include anhedonia (diminished interest in activities), pervasive feelings of hopelessness, depressed mood, irritability, and increased anxiety and worry, including episodes of panic. Sleep disturbances are evident, with reduced sleep duration coupled with non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns are noted, including forgetfulness and difficulties with concentration. Intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors such as repetitive washing and checking, suggest obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Experiences of depersonalization or derealization, along with feelings of emotional detachment and identity confusion, point toward dissociative phenomena. There is also a report of somatic complaints, notably headaches and muscle tension, which may be stress-related.\n\nPatterns observed include persistent mood disturbance, heightened anxiety and agitation, intrusive and compulsive symptoms, as well as dissociative experiences. The patient reports a history of passive suicidal ideation without active planning, indicating potential risk for self-harm.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and dissociative symptoms. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants careful risk assessment. No substance use or self-harm behaviors are currently reported, reducing immediate risk in those domains.\n\nOverall, the presentation suggests a multifaceted mood and anxiety disorder with prominent obsessive-compulsive and dissociative features, necessitating comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing range of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym> (loss of interest), and <sym>depressed mood</sym>. Your worries and <sym>anxiety</sym>, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, seem to be overwhelming at times, and these feelings are accompanied by sleep disturbances, such as difficulty sleeping and feeling unrested. You also described intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> related to contamination and harm, along with <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> like repetitive washing and checking, which suggest obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative</sym> phenomena, such as feeling disconnected from yourself or your surroundings, and some somatic complaints like headaches and muscle tension. You\u2019ve also expressed feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> and <sym>relationship difficulties</sym>. Importantly, you\u2019ve had some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, though you have not acted on them. Your openness in sharing these experiences demonstrates your willingness to seek help, and I want to acknowledge that these symptoms can be very challenging to cope with.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>, and <med>Dissociative Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient presents with a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of increased <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and worry aligns with <med>Anxious Features</med>. The presence of intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with repetitive <sym>behaviors</sym> such as washing and checking, suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med>. Experiences of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>depersonalization</sym>, as well as feelings of emotional <sym>dissociation</sym>, indicate <med>Dissociative Features</med>. Overall, these symptoms co-occur and significantly impair functioning, fitting a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying medical conditions, especially considering somatic complaints.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), tailored to address depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Engage in psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), focusing on mood management, anxiety reduction, and exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Monitor for safety given the presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, and develop a safety plan.  \n5. Explore additional interventions for dissociative symptoms if they persist or worsen, potentially involving trauma-informed therapy.  \n6. Consider referral to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances continue to impact daily functioning.",
