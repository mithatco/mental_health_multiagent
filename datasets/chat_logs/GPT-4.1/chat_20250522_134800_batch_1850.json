We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms over the past two weeks. The purpose of this assessment is to better understand your current mental health state, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and other areas that might be affecting you. Please rest assured that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. I will ask you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, and you can respond honestly based on your experiences. Are you ready to begin?"

The additional symptoms of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and decreased need for sleep with increased energy point toward a mixed mood state with possible <med>manic or hypomanic features</med>.

Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate risk factors, including suicidality and substance use.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and crisis resources.\n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and consider pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Address substance use through counseling, motivational interviewing, or referral to specialized addiction treatment if appropriate.\n5. Monitor mood, anxiety, and safety regularly, adjusting treatment as needed, and consider involving a multidisciplinary team if dissociative or obsessive-compulsive symptoms persist.\n6. Explore social and support systems to reduce feelings of disconnection and enhance engagement.",

There is evidence of increased irritability, impulsivity, and psychomotor agitation, manifested by heightened energy levels despite reduced sleep and engagement in risky or impulsive behaviors. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, characterized by persistent worry, feelings of being on edge, and episodic panic attacks, alongside avoidance behaviors related to social and situational triggers.\n\nSomatic complaints, such as unexplained aches, pains, and tension, are reported, accompanied by sleep disturbances involving frequent awakenings and non-restorative sleep. Cognitive concerns include episodic memory issues and intrusive thoughts, some compulsive in nature, suggestive of obsessive-compulsive phenomena. Experiences of dissociation and identity disturbance indicate potential underlying features of dissociative symptoms or identity-related distress.\n\nThe patient exhibits notably low interpersonal connectedness, with reports of emotional distancing from loved ones and a sense of being lost or unsure of personal identity. Substance use behaviors are significant, including regular cigarette smoking, elevated alcohol intake, and non-prescribed use of medications, which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include suicidal ideation, impulsivity, substance misuse, and panic episodes\u2014each warranting urgent clinical attention. The presence of anhedonia, depressed mood, and suicidality suggests a possible major depressive episode, potentially with comorbid anxiety features. The impulsive and risky behaviors, along with substance use, further complicate the clinical picture.\n\nOverall, this patient demonstrates complex affective, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms with notable risk factors for self-harm and impaired functioning. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment and safety planning are recommended to evaluate mood disorder severity, identify underlying diagnoses, and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to experience these feelings and symptoms. You are going through a lot right now, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks. Alongside these, you\u2019ve described increased <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, as well as significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. You\u2019re also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>. Additionally, there are notable concerns about <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>. It\u2019s understandable that this combination of symptoms is overwhelming and impacting your daily functioning and emotional well-being. Please know that your experiences are valid, and help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Impulsivity</med>, and <med>Substance Use</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The additional symptoms of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and decreased need for sleep with increased energy point toward a mixed mood state with possible <med>manic or hypomanic features</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, such as persistent worry, feelings of being on edge, and episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> may reflect obsessive-compulsive or dissociative features, complicating the clinical picture. The report of ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates significant risk factors requiring urgent attention. Overall, the constellation of mood disturbance, anxiety, impulsivity, dissociative symptoms, and substance use suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder with comorbid features, warranting comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate risk factors, including suicidality and substance use.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and crisis resources.\n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and consider pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Address substance use through counseling, motivational interviewing, or referral to specialized addiction treatment if appropriate.\n5. Monitor mood, anxiety, and safety regularly, adjusting treatment as needed, and consider involving a multidisciplinary team if dissociative or obsessive-compulsive symptoms persist.\n6. Explore social and support systems to reduce feelings of disconnection and enhance engagement.",
