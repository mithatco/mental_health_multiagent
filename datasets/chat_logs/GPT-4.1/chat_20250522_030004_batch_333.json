It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with heightened <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym> that affect how you relate to yourself and others, as well as physical symptoms like muscle tension, headaches, and sleep difficulties. You\u2019ve also expressed feelings of <sym>being misunderstood</sym> and some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and highlight the importance of careful monitoring and support. Your efforts to manage your anxiety by avoiding certain situations and withdrawing from relationships show how distressing these symptoms have become, yet your awareness and honesty are important steps toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with episodic <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and difficulties with concentration support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Concurrently, the patient describes pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, with frequent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and rapid heartbeat, consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences during panic episodes and social withdrawal are also notable but appear secondary to the primary mood and anxiety diagnoses. The history of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants ongoing safety assessment. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs) combined with evidence-based psychotherapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Conduct regular safety assessments focusing on <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if risk escalates.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and engage actively in treatment.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a mental health counselor for ongoing psychotherapy.  \n5. Explore additional support options, such as social skills training or group therapy, especially to address social withdrawal and disconnection.",

They describe heightened irritability and increased anxiety, particularly in public settings, with ongoing worry and physical manifestations such as muscle tension and headaches. The patient also reports experiencing panic attacks, including symptoms of intense fear, palpitations, and a sensation of losing control. Sleep disturbances are evident, with difficulty maintaining restful sleep and early awakenings. Cognitive concerns include episodic forgetfulness and disorientation during periods of heightened anxiety. Additionally, feelings of dissociation or depersonalization are noted during panic episodes. The patient reports social withdrawal to avoid triggering situations, and some thoughts of self-harm, though they deny current suicidal intent.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**  \nThe responses indicate co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with prominent panic attacks and avoidance behaviors. There is a consistent pattern of emotional distress, including depressive and anxious symptoms, with associated somatic complaints. The patient demonstrates insight into their condition, acknowledging the impact on daily functioning and relationships. Their avoidance of social situations and feelings of disconnection suggest social withdrawal and potential interpersonal difficulties.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**  \n- Major depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, hopelessness, and fatigue  \n- Severe anxiety with panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance  \n- Dissociative experiences during panic episodes  \n- Sleep disturbances impacting overall functioning  \n- Intrusive thoughts and ruminative worry  \n- Risk of self-harm thoughts, warranting ongoing assessment of suicidality\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**  \nThe presence of passive suicidal ideation, even without intent, necessitates careful monitoring. Panic attacks and avoidance behaviors may contribute to social isolation and functional impairment. Dissociative symptoms and feelings of disconnection could exacerbate distress or increase risk if unaddressed.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical picture characterized by major depressive symptoms, severe generalized and panic-related anxiety, dissociative experiences, and sleep disruption. These symptoms collectively impair social engagement and overall well-being. The acknowledgment of passive self-harm thoughts underscores the importance of vigilant risk assessment and formulation of a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, and safety concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a challenging and multifaceted picture of your current experience. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with heightened <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym> that affect how you relate to yourself and others, as well as physical symptoms like muscle tension, headaches, and sleep difficulties. You\u2019ve also expressed feelings of <sym>being misunderstood</sym> and some thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which are concerning and highlight the importance of careful monitoring and support. Your efforts to manage your anxiety by avoiding certain situations and withdrawing from relationships show how distressing these symptoms have become, yet your awareness and honesty are important steps toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with episodic <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and difficulties with concentration support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Concurrently, the patient describes pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, with frequent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, and physical symptoms such as muscle tension and rapid heartbeat, consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences during panic episodes and social withdrawal are also notable but appear secondary to the primary mood and anxiety diagnoses. The history of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants ongoing safety assessment. Overall, the presentation suggests a complex interplay of mood and anxiety symptoms, with significant functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan including pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs) combined with evidence-based psychotherapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Conduct regular safety assessments focusing on <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> risk, with immediate intervention if risk escalates.  \n3. Provide psychoeducation about <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med> to help the patient understand their experiences and engage actively in treatment.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a mental health counselor for ongoing psychotherapy.  \n5. Explore additional support options, such as social skills training or group therapy, especially to address social withdrawal and disconnection.",
