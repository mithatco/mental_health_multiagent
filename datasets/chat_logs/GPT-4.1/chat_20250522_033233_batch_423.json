This assessment helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you.

Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting social anxiety to help develop coping skills and reduce avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, to address symptoms of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.  \n3. Conduct a comprehensive assessment to rule out other possible comorbidities, including dissociative or trauma-related disorders.  \n4. Develop a sleep hygiene plan to improve sleep quality and address insomnia symptoms.  \n5. Encourage gradual exposure to social situations to reduce fear and avoidance, with support from a mental health professional.",

Notable symptoms include persistent feelings of depression and anhedonia, as well as irritability and sleep disturbances, suggesting comorbid depressive features. The patient reports frequent anxiety and panic attacks, particularly in social contexts, accompanied by physical manifestations such as headaches and stomachaches. Cognitive concerns include episodic forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments, potentially reflecting anxiety-related cognitive impairment or stress-related attentional deficits. Intrusive negative thoughts centered on self-embarrassment, coupled with feelings of detachment or dissociation during heightened anxiety episodes, are present. The patient denies suicidal ideation, self-harm, psychotic symptoms, substance use, or behavioral compulsions. Social withdrawal and a lack of close interpersonal relationships further underscore social isolation.\n\nPatterns observed include consistent social avoidance, heightened anxiety pre- and during social interactions, and somatic complaints associated with anxiety. The patient's responses suggest significant functional impairment related to social fears, mood disturbance, and sleep disruption.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass social anxiety disorder with agoraphobic tendencies, comorbid depressive symptoms, and possible dissociative experiences amid anxiety. No immediate risk factors such as suicidal ideation, self-harm, or substance misuse are identified. Ongoing assessment should focus on the severity of social anxiety, depressive symptoms, dissociative phenomena, and functional impairment to inform targeted intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience significant <sym>social anxiety</sym>, which leads to avoiding social situations and feeling intense <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> about social interactions. You also mentioned experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, with physical symptoms like a racing heart and feeling like you might lose control, especially when speaking in front of others. It\u2019s understandable that these experiences make you feel <sym>isolated</sym> and <sym>detached</sym> from others, and that they contribute to your feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You\u2019ve also noted difficulties with <sym>sleep</sym>, <sym>forgetfulness</sym>, and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, which seem to impact your overall well-being. Your insights into these patterns show that you are experiencing considerable distress and impairment in daily functioning, especially regarding social relationships and self-perception.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> (moderate severity)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate pervasive and intense fear of social situations, consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. This is evidenced by avoidance behaviors, physical symptoms such as <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and cognitive worries about <quote>saying something wrong or embarrassing myself</quote>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbance</sym> suggest comorbid <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The episodic <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> could relate to high anxiety levels or dissociative experiences associated with the distress. No evidence of psychosis or substance misuse is present, and the symptoms seem primarily driven by social fears and mood disturbance.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting social anxiety to help develop coping skills and reduce avoidance behaviors.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, to address symptoms of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.  \n3. Conduct a comprehensive assessment to rule out other possible comorbidities, including dissociative or trauma-related disorders.  \n4. Develop a sleep hygiene plan to improve sleep quality and address insomnia symptoms.  \n5. Encourage gradual exposure to social situations to reduce fear and avoidance, with support from a mental health professional.",
