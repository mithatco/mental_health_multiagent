Additionally, there are significant cognitive concerns, notably forgetfulness and concentration difficulties. Somatic complaints include frequent headaches and stomachaches, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by hypersomnia and unrefreshing sleep.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of excessive worry, restlessness, and episodes of panic characterized by physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. The patient exhibits behavioral avoidance of social situations, which may contribute to social withdrawal. Intrusive thoughts related to stressors suggest possible ruminative or obsessive features, though compulsive behaviors are not reported.\n\nThe patient acknowledges passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plans, alongside dark thoughts of escape. Substance use appears maladaptive, with episodes of increased alcohol consumption during periods of distress and occasional smoking for relief of anxiety.\n\nRisk factors include the presence of suicidal ideation, panic episodes, substance use, and social withdrawal. The symptom profile indicates significant mood and anxiety disturbances, with possible comorbidities affecting sleep, cognition, and somatic health.\n\n**Overall, the patient demonstrates a complex presentation characterized by depressive and anxiety symptoms, with potential risks for self-harm and substance misuse.

The patient's presentation aligns with a significant depressive and anxiety pathology rather than an adjustment disorder, which typically involves a more situational and less severe response to stress.

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, which has left you feeling numb and disconnected. You also mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and overwhelmed by <sym>dark thoughts</sym>, with episodes of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> that include physical sensations like a racing heart and difficulty breathing. Your sleep patterns have changed, with <sym>hypersomnia</sym> and unrefreshing sleep, and you've noticed difficulties with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. Additionally, you've described <sym>physical aches</sym> such as headaches and stomachaches, along with <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> from yourself and others, and a sense of <sym>being lost or unsure of who you are</sym>. You also shared concerns about <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and some <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope with these feelings. It\u2019s clear that you're going through a very challenging time, and your openness is a positive step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder, with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>physical complaints</sym> further support this diagnosis. The reports of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym> indicate significant <med>Anxiety symptoms</med> that often co-occur with depression. The <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and questioning of <sym>self-identity</sym> suggest possible <med>Derealization or Depersonalization</med> phenomena, which can be associated with severe mood or anxiety disorders. Suicidal ideation, though passive, warrants careful attention. The patient's substance use appears to be an attempt at self-medication. Overall, the symptoms suggest a complex mood and anxiety disorder with somatic and cognitive features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other medical or psychiatric conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>Antidepressant medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs) and consider <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or interpersonal therapy) to address mood, anxiety, and thought patterns.  \n3. Assess and monitor for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> regularly, ensuring safety planning and providing crisis resources as needed.  \n4. Address substance use behaviors through psychoeducation and consider referral to specialized addiction services if appropriate.  \n5. Explore additional support for managing <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, possibly including a medical evaluation to rule out underlying physical health issues.",
