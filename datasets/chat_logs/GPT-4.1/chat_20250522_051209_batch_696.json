Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a brief assessment that asks about different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It helps us get a clearer picture of your overall well-being and identify any areas that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others. I will ask each question one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Refer to a psychiatrist for medication management and a psychologist or therapist experienced in bipolar disorder for psychotherapy, such as CBT or psychoeducation.  \n4.

Address comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms with appropriate interventions, possibly including trauma-informed therapy if indicated.  \n6.

Key symptoms include pervasive anhedonia and low motivation, feelings of hopelessness, and episodic elevated mood states with increased energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, and engagement in risky behaviors. During depressive episodes, the patient reports hypersomnia, cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and focus issues, and social withdrawal. Conversely, manic episodes involve decreased sleep, heightened irritability, impulsivity, and a tendency to start multiple projects without completion.\n\nThe patient also reports episodes of anxiety, including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, as well as transient dissociative experiences such as feeling disconnected from oneself and one\u2019s environment. Intrusive thoughts and dark ruminations about death are present, though the patient denies active self-harm intentions or hallucinations. Physical complaints include unexplained aches and pains, which may correlate with somatic symptomatology linked to mood states.\n\nPattern analysis reveals mood instability with alternating depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms, along with anxiety and dissociative features. Substance use appears limited to episodic alcohol consumption, with no current tobacco or illicit drug use reported.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety features, risk of suicidal ideation, and dissociative symptoms. The presence of impulsivity, mood swings, and recent social withdrawal warrants ongoing risk assessment for self-harm or suicidal behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient exhibits significant mood instability characterized by depressive symptoms, manic/hypomanic episodes, and associated anxiety and dissociative experiences. The symptomatology suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder with notable comorbidities that require careful monitoring and comprehensive clinical evaluation to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a complex and nuanced experience with mood swings that include episodes of <sym>depression</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal. At the same time, you've described episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> with <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and engaging in risky behaviors, which suggests <med>mania/hypomania</med>. You\u2019ve also mentioned feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and moments of dissociation such as feeling <sym>disconnected</sym> from yourself or your surroundings. Physical symptoms like unexplained aches and pains further complicate your picture, and despite these struggles, you\u2019re actively aware of and reflecting on your emotional states. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re navigating a lot right now, and your openness is an important step toward understanding and managing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder (current or past episode of <sym>mania/hypomania</sym> with <sym>depressive episodes</sym>)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (low motivation, hopelessness, social withdrawal, hypersomnia, cognitive difficulties) alternating with episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> (reduced sleep, irritability, impulsivity, risky behaviors), which aligns with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>manic or hypomanic episodes</sym> characterized by <sym>inflated energy</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and <sym>mood elevation</sym> supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's experiences of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, are comorbid features often seen in mood disorders. The episodic nature and severity of mood swings distinguish this from <med>Borderline Personality Disorder</med> and other mood-related conditions. While some physical symptoms are noted, they appear secondary to mood episodes rather than indicative of primary somatic issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a detailed history of mood episodes, frequency, duration, and severity, to confirm the diagnosis.  \n2. Initiate a mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium, valproate) and consider adjunctive therapy for managing symptoms, tailored to mood episodes.  \n3. Refer to a psychiatrist for medication management and a psychologist or therapist experienced in bipolar disorder for psychotherapy, such as CBT or psychoeducation.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation or self-harm risk, especially given reports of <quote>dark thoughts about death</quote>.  \n5. Address comorbid anxiety and dissociative symptoms with appropriate interventions, possibly including trauma-informed therapy if indicated.  \n6. Encourage regular sleep routines and lifestyle modifications to stabilize mood fluctuations.",
