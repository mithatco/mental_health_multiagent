These episodes, along with ongoing <sym>worry</sym> about having another attack and <sym>avoidance</sym> of situations that might trigger panic, have led to considerable <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and difficulty engaging with others. You also report <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as frequent awakenings and feeling exhausted during the day, as well as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to your panic and safety concerns. Alongside these, you describe <sym>mood symptoms</sym> like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. Some feelings of dissociation occur during or after panic episodes, and you\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>lost</sym> and disconnected from your identity and relationships. There are also somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>chest tightness</sym>, though medical evaluation has not found physical causes. Notably, you have experienced some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which is important to address carefully. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of severe anxiety, panic disorder, and depressive features impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and Major Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with associated <sym>hyperventilation</sym>, <sym>heart racing</sym>, and fear of losing control, along with avoidance of situations that might trigger attacks, consistent with <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Agoraphobia</med>. The pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of being lost, support a comorbid <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The dissociative experiences during panic episodes further suggest heightened distress. The somatic complaints, although physically unexplained, align with anxiety-related somatic symptoms. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants close monitoring, but no active intent is indicated. The overall pattern indicates a severe anxiety disorder with depressive features, impairing functioning across multiple domains.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity and impact of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to target both panic and depressive symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address panic, avoidance behaviors, and depressive cognitions.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and possibly pharmacological support, if appropriate.  \n5. Provide Psychoeducation about anxiety, panic, and depression, along with coping strategies and relapse prevention.  \n6. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal ideation or behaviors, and develop a safety plan as needed.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal. The patient reports ongoing anxious arousal characterized by pervasive worry, panic attacks with associated somatic sensations (e.g., chest tightness, hyperventilation), and avoidance behaviors, particularly toward situations perceived as high-risk for panic episodes. Sleep disturbances are notable, with frequent nocturnal awakenings and non-restorative sleep contributing to daytime exhaustion. Intrusive thoughts related to panic and safety concerns are evident, alongside dissociative experiences during or following panic episodes. The patient expresses a sense of identity confusion and disconnection from surroundings, coupled with social isolation. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse is noted. The presence of passive suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\") warrants careful assessment of risk, although no active intent or plans are described.

      "expected": "panic",
      "predicted": "You are experiencing significant distress related to persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> characterized by symptoms like <sym>shortness of breath</sym>, <sym>racing heart</sym>, and feelings of losing control. These episodes, along with ongoing <sym>worry</sym> about having another attack and <sym>avoidance</sym> of situations that might trigger panic, have led to considerable <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and difficulty engaging with others. You also report <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> such as frequent awakenings and feeling exhausted during the day, as well as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to your panic and safety concerns. Alongside these, you describe <sym>mood symptoms</sym> like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. Some feelings of dissociation occur during or after panic episodes, and you\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>lost</sym> and disconnected from your identity and relationships. There are also somatic complaints like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>chest tightness</sym>, though medical evaluation has not found physical causes. Notably, you have experienced some <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm, which is important to address carefully. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex picture of severe anxiety, panic disorder, and depressive features impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and Major Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with associated <sym>hyperventilation</sym>, <sym>heart racing</sym>, and fear of losing control, along with avoidance of situations that might trigger attacks, consistent with <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Agoraphobia</med>. The pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of being lost, support a comorbid <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. The dissociative experiences during panic episodes further suggest heightened distress. The somatic complaints, although physically unexplained, align with anxiety-related somatic symptoms. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants close monitoring, but no active intent is indicated. The overall pattern indicates a severe anxiety disorder with depressive features, impairing functioning across multiple domains.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity and impact of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.  \n2. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to target both panic and depressive symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), to address panic, avoidance behaviors, and depressive cognitions.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and possibly pharmacological support, if appropriate.  \n5. Provide Psychoeducation about anxiety, panic, and depression, along with coping strategies and relapse prevention.  \n6. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal ideation or behaviors, and develop a safety plan as needed.",
