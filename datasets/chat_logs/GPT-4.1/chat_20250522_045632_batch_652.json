It sounds like you often go through cycles of feeling very low, with <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and then episodes where your energy increases, sleep decreases, and you engage in impulsive or risky behaviors. You mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym>, experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of dissociation, and sometimes feeling misunderstood or dismissed by others. These mood swings and related symptoms seem to significantly impact your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> (with features of <med>depressive episodes</med> and <med>hypomanic episodes</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and social withdrawal, alternating with periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and increased energy, suggest a pattern consistent with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>hypomanic episodes</sym>\u2014noted by <quote>feeling wired and full of energy</quote> and engaging in risky behaviors\u2014is key to this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms do not indicate full-blown mania, and the mood shifts appear to be episodic and cyclical, aligning with bipolar spectrum characteristics. Additionally, some symptoms such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and dissociation could be related to comorbid anxiety or mood-related features, but they do not override the primary mood disorder pattern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm bipolar diagnosis, including detailed mood history and symptom chronology.  \n2. Evaluate the severity and risk of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or self-harm, especially during depressive episodes.  \n3. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and substance use, as these can impact mood stability.  \n5. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and ongoing psychiatric care.",

Key symptoms include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal, indicating depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, reports of decreased sleep duration during hypomanic episodes, increased energy, impulsivity, risk-taking behaviors, and rapid speech suggest episodes of elevated mood or hypomania. The patient also reports anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and feelings of being overwhelmed, which may reflect comorbid anxiety features or mood disorder-related agitation.\n\nPattern analysis reveals cyclical mood fluctuations with periods of low mood and anhedonia interspersed with high-energy, impulsive episodes. There are also perceptual disturbances described as racing thoughts and intrusive thoughts, alongside feelings of dissociation or depersonalization. The patient indicates difficulty maintaining close relationships and social withdrawal during low states, alongside transient paranoid or intrusive ideations.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Bipolar disorder spectrum features (mood swings, sleep disturbance, impulsivity)\n- Comorbid anxiety symptoms (worry, feeling on edge)\n- Intrusive thoughts and dissociative experiences\n- Risk factors for self-harm or suicidal ideation, evidenced by mention of death thoughts during depressive episodes, although no active intent reported\n- Substance use patterns, with occasional alcohol and tobacco use, which may influence mood and behavior\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and thoughts about death\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes\n- Social withdrawal and emotional numbness during depressive phases\n- Intrusive and persistent negative or distressing thoughts\n\nOverall, the patient's responses suggest a mood disorder with bipolar features, necessitating comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and risk assessment. Further exploration of current suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and functional impairment is recommended to inform treatment planning.",

      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and fluctuating emotional experience. It sounds like you often go through cycles of feeling very low, with <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, and then episodes where your energy increases, sleep decreases, and you engage in impulsive or risky behaviors. You mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym>, experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of dissociation, and sometimes feeling misunderstood or dismissed by others. These mood swings and related symptoms seem to significantly impact your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I appreciate your openness in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> (with features of <med>depressive episodes</med> and <med>hypomanic episodes</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct mood episodes characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and social withdrawal, alternating with periods of <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and increased energy, suggest a pattern consistent with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>hypomanic episodes</sym>\u2014noted by <quote>feeling wired and full of energy</quote> and engaging in risky behaviors\u2014is key to this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms do not indicate full-blown mania, and the mood shifts appear to be episodic and cyclical, aligning with bipolar spectrum characteristics. Additionally, some symptoms such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and dissociation could be related to comorbid anxiety or mood-related features, but they do not override the primary mood disorder pattern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm bipolar diagnosis, including detailed mood history and symptom chronology.  \n2. Evaluate the severity and risk of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or self-harm, especially during depressive episodes.  \n3. Develop a treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and substance use, as these can impact mood stability.  \n5. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and ongoing psychiatric care.",
