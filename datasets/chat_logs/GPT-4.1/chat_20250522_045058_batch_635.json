Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms you may have experienced over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions together, one at a time. Are you ready to start?"

You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>sadness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your mood seems low, and you\u2019ve been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, especially in social situations, which you tend to avoid. Sleep difficulties, including waking during the night and feeling tired despite less sleep, are also impacting you. You\u2019ve noticed some <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and engage in <sym>checking behaviors</sym> that seem compulsive. Additionally, you experience occasional <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like feeling detached from yourself or the environment. While you have had <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to disappear, you do not have active plans to harm yourself. Your cognitive concerns, such as forgetfulness and feeling lost at times, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, further complicate your picture. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant mood and anxiety challenges, with some dissociative experiences and sleep issues that warrant careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, with features of social anxiety</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms (Provisional)>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially related to social situations, avoidance behaviors, and panic episodes, suggest a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> with social anxiety features. The report of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like feeling detached and observing oneself from outside, although intermittent, raises the possibility of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety conditions. The presence of intrusive thoughts and checking behaviors may indicate obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but further assessment would clarify this. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or active suicidal intent reduces immediate risk but underscores the need for ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms and to explore possible comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, and consider medication management if appropriate.  \n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and dissociative symptoms, with safety planning as needed.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist or specialist for further evaluation of dissociative experiences and to assess the need for medication.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and monitor sleep hygiene, with possible sleep assessment if sleep issues persist.",

Notably, they report persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and episodic sadness over the past two weeks, aligning with depressive symptomatology. Concurrently, the patient describes pervasive anxiety, including heightened feelings of nervousness, being on edge, and panic episodes, particularly in social contexts, suggesting significant social anxiety or social phobia features. They also report avoidance behaviors related to social situations, which may reinforce social withdrawal.\n\nAdditional features include sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep, as well as cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and occasional disorientation. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like checking behaviors suggest possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies, although these are not explicitly characterized as compulsions. Sensory phenomena such as feeling detached or observing oneself from outside the body are reported intermittently, raising consideration of dissociative experiences.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (\"wishing I could just disappear\") without active plans or intent, and the presence of dark thoughts, which warrant close monitoring. The absence of substance use, psychotic symptoms (e.g., auditory hallucinations or thought broadcasting), and recent substance or medication misuse are noted.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture indicates a complex presentation involving depressive symptoms, anxiety, social avoidance, sleep disturbance, cognitive concerns, and dissociative experiences. These findings suggest a need for comprehensive assessment to determine diagnosable conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and potentially Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum features, with attention to suicidality and dissociation as areas of clinical concern.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex mix of emotional and physical symptoms that have been affecting your daily life over the past two weeks. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>sadness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. Your mood seems low, and you\u2019ve been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, especially in social situations, which you tend to avoid. Sleep difficulties, including waking during the night and feeling tired despite less sleep, are also impacting you. You\u2019ve noticed some <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and engage in <sym>checking behaviors</sym> that seem compulsive. Additionally, you experience occasional <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like feeling detached from yourself or the environment. While you have had <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to disappear, you do not have active plans to harm yourself. Your cognitive concerns, such as forgetfulness and feeling lost at times, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, further complicate your picture. Overall, your symptoms reflect significant mood and anxiety challenges, with some dissociative experiences and sleep issues that warrant careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified, with features of social anxiety</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms (Provisional)>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially related to social situations, avoidance behaviors, and panic episodes, suggest a significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> with social anxiety features. The report of <sym>dissociative feelings</sym> like feeling detached and observing oneself from outside, although intermittent, raises the possibility of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can occur alongside mood and anxiety conditions. The presence of intrusive thoughts and checking behaviors may indicate obsessive-compulsive tendencies, but further assessment would clarify this. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or active suicidal intent reduces immediate risk but underscores the need for ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms and to explore possible comorbid conditions.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> for depression and anxiety, and consider medication management if appropriate.  \n3. Monitor for suicidal ideation and dissociative symptoms, with safety planning as needed.  \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist or specialist for further evaluation of dissociative experiences and to assess the need for medication.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and monitor sleep hygiene, with possible sleep assessment if sleep issues persist.",
