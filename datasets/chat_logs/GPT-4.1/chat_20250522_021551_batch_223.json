This assessment helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks.

These depressive symptoms are compounded by sleep disturbances characterized by early morning awakening and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), and cognitive complaints such as memory impairment and disorientation (Q16). The patient reports intrusive, negative thoughts and feelings of emotional detachment or derealization (Q17, Q19, Q20), alongside a sense of social withdrawal and diminished interpersonal engagement (Q9, Q21).\n\nAnxiety-related symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, physical sensations of fear, and avoidance behaviors (Q7, Q8, Q9). The patient also describes episodic experiences of transient fear or panic-like sensations (Q8). Notably, there are indications of somatic complaints, including unexplained headaches and back pain (Q10), which may be related to psychosomatic factors.\n\nThe patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without concrete plans (Q12), raising concern for ongoing risk. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as auditory or thought broadcasting experiences (Q13, Q14) is reported. Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol misuse or illicit drug use (Q22, Q23).\n\nPattern analysis reveals a pattern consistent with comorbid depression and anxiety, with elements suggestive of affective dysregulation, psychomotor slowing, cognitive impairment, and social withdrawal. The presence of passive SI warrants careful risk assessment. The patient\u2019s self-reported dissociative experiences and feelings of identity loss suggest potential dissociative symptoms or depersonalization phenomena.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible dissociative features. The suicidal ideation, albeit passive, necessitates close monitoring. Ongoing assessment of risk factors, including SI and functional impairment, is essential to inform treatment planning.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex constellation of symptoms that reflect significant <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxious</med> features. They report feelings of <sym>emptiness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased irritability and social withdrawal. Sleep disturbances, such as early awakening and poor sleep quality, are prominent, accompanied by cognitive concerns like memory difficulties and feelings of disconnection from themselves and their surroundings. The patient also shares passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and intrusive negative thoughts, which indicate ongoing emotional distress and potential risk factors. These symptoms seem to have persisted over the past two weeks, significantly impacting their daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate severity with co-occurring Generalized Anxiety Disorder and features of Dissociative Symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of chronic worry, physical symptoms of anxiety, and avoidance behaviors support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of feelings of derealization, depersonalization, and identity confusion suggest dissociative phenomena. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> are concerning and warrant close monitoring. No psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or thought broadcasting are reported, and substance use appears minimal. The pattern of symptoms indicates a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an SSRI, after evaluating for contraindications and patient preferences.  \n4. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for comprehensive medication management if pharmacotherapy is indicated.  \n5. Explore the potential benefits of trauma-focused therapy if dissociative symptoms or past trauma are identified.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety.  \n7. Encourage engagement in activities that may improve mood and social connection, when feasible.",
