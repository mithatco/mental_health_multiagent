They report pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, persistent <sym>feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. These are accompanied by notable <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as early awakening and difficulty maintaining restful sleep, which contribute to ongoing fatigue. The individual also describes episodes of <sym>anxiety and panic</sym>, including <sym>feeling on edge, experiencing intense panic attacks, and avoiding anxiety-provoking situations</sym>. They acknowledge <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>feelings of dissociation or depersonalization</sym>, and <sym>uncertainty about their identity and future</sym>. Substance use appears to be a concern, with regular smoking, episodic alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion, and recent use of prescription painkillers without medical guidance. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further underscores the urgency of comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, evidenced by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of hopelessness, and significant functional impairment. The reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, excessive worry, avoidance, and physical symptoms suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The substance use behaviors, including alcohol and non-prescribed medication use, indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative experiences, such as <sym>feeling detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, point to possible dissociative features, which are often seen in severe mood or trauma-related disorders. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> necessitates urgent attention. Overall, these symptoms form a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess suicide risk, and evaluate for underlying trauma or dissociative disorders.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Develop an integrated treatment plan including <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-focused therapy), <med>psychiatric medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents), and <sym>substance use treatment</sym> to address the current substance misuse.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medication adjustments to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of ongoing support.  \n6. Coordinate care with primary medical providers if somatic complaints persist or worsen.",

Cognitive concerns include episodic forgetfulness and disorientation, alongside experiences of dissociation and identity uncertainty, indicating potential dissociative symptoms or depersonalization. The patient also endorses intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive mental routines, suggestive of obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with early awakening and non-restorative sleep contributing to ongoing fatigue.\n\nSubstance use patterns include regular cigarette smoking, episodic alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion, and recent non-prescribed use of prescription painkillers, indicating substance use behaviors that may exacerbate mental health issues or pose additional risks.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Ideation of self-harm/thoughts of escape, suggesting active suicidal ideation.\n- Reports of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors, elevating anxiety severity.\n- Substance misuse, which may impair judgment and increase risk.\n- Feelings of emotional numbness, disconnection, and identity confusion, raising concerns about dissociative or psychotic features.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture reflects significant mood and anxiety symptomatology, compounded by substance use and dissociative experiences, warranting comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "The patient is experiencing a complex array of symptoms that significantly impact their emotional and physical well-being. They report pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, persistent <sym>feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. These are accompanied by notable <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, such as early awakening and difficulty maintaining restful sleep, which contribute to ongoing fatigue. The individual also describes episodes of <sym>anxiety and panic</sym>, including <sym>feeling on edge, experiencing intense panic attacks, and avoiding anxiety-provoking situations</sym>. They acknowledge <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, <sym>feelings of dissociation or depersonalization</sym>, and <sym>uncertainty about their identity and future</sym>. Substance use appears to be a concern, with regular smoking, episodic alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion, and recent use of prescription painkillers without medical guidance. The presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further underscores the urgency of comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, evidenced by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of hopelessness, and significant functional impairment. The reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, excessive worry, avoidance, and physical symptoms suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The substance use behaviors, including alcohol and non-prescribed medication use, indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms. The dissociative experiences, such as <sym>feeling detached from oneself</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, point to possible dissociative features, which are often seen in severe mood or trauma-related disorders. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> necessitates urgent attention. Overall, these symptoms form a complex clinical picture requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses, assess suicide risk, and evaluate for underlying trauma or dissociative disorders.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and consider hospitalization if risk is imminent.  \n3. Develop an integrated treatment plan including <med>psychotherapy</med> (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or trauma-focused therapy), <med>psychiatric medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents), and <sym>substance use treatment</sym> to address the current substance misuse.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral interventions or medication adjustments to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, coping strategies, and the importance of ongoing support.  \n6. Coordinate care with primary medical providers if somatic complaints persist or worsen.",
