There is a notable presence of irritability and increased irritability, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia and restlessness, which contribute to daytime fatigue. Anxiety features are prominent, with reports of pervasive worry, feeling on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in crowded or overwhelming environments, suggestive of agoraphobic or social anxiety tendencies. The patient also reports perceptual disturbances, including auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid ideation (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read their mind), indicating possible psychotic features. Intrusive and recurrent distressing thoughts, along with compulsive-like behaviors such as checking or counting, suggest obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Dissociative symptoms are evident, including feelings of detachment from self and environment, as well as identity confusion. Cognitive concerns include memory impairment and disorientation, which may be related to mood, anxiety, or other neurocognitive factors. The patient expresses social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection from others, aligning with social isolation and affective blunting.\n\nSubstance use is notable, with recent alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels on some days, and regular tobacco use, alongside self-directed intake of medications or substances without medical oversight, raising concerns about potential substance misuse and associated health risks. The patient admits to suicidal ideation, which constitutes a significant safety concern requiring immediate attention.\n\nPatterns indicate a high degree of emotional distress across multiple domains, with overlapping symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis, and dissociation. The presentation suggests a possible mood disorder with psychotic features, comorbid anxiety disorder, and substance use issues. The presence of suicidal thoughts constitutes a critical risk factor.\n\nOverall, this assessment underscores the necessity for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including risk assessment for self-harm, exploration of psychotic and dissociative symptoms, evaluation of substance use, and formulation of an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, psychosis, anxiety, and substance use components.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. It\u2019s clear that you are experiencing a wide range of difficult symptoms, including persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down most days</quote>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>emotional numbness</sym>. You also describe significant <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, with trouble falling and staying asleep, which leave you feeling <quote>tired during the day</quote>. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>worrying about things you can't explain</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, and experiencing <sym>panic episodes</sym>. There are perceptual disturbances like <quote>hearing voices</quote> and paranoid thoughts that others can <quote>read your mind</quote>. You also report <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>checking behaviors</sym>, and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>, such as <quote>feeling outside of yourself</quote>. Additionally, you mention <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>confusion about your identity and goals</sym>, along with <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication with substances, adds to the complexity of your situation. Your thoughts of <quote>hurting yourself</quote> highlight the seriousness of your current emotional state and the need for immediate attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Dissociative Symptoms, and Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol and Nicotine)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling down and hopeless</quote>, combined with <sym>emotional numbness</sym> and irritability. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and paranoid ideation suggests <med>psychotic features</med> associated with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of pervasive <sym>worry, feeling on edge, panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behavior points toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences, including <sym>feeling detached from self and surroundings</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym>, support a diagnosis that includes <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym>. The recent <sym>substance use</sym> with alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication complicates the clinical picture and warrants careful consideration of <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The active <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> indicates a high level of risk that requires urgent intervention. Overall, the constellation of mood, psychotic, anxiety, dissociative, and substance-related symptoms aligns with this multifaceted clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including risk assessment for <sym>self-harm</sym> and <sym>suicide</sym>.  \n2. Initiate safety planning and consider immediate clinical support if there's ongoing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.  \n3. Develop a coordinated treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant therapy</med>, <med>antipsychotic medication</med> if psychotic symptoms persist, and <med>psychotherapy</med> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed approaches.  \n4. Address <sym>substance use</sym> through counseling and support services, and consider referral to specialized addiction treatment if needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the nature of symptoms and involve supportive services to reduce social isolation.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and safety concerns.",
