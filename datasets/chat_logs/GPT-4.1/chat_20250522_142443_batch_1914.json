We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. I'll be asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and your honest answers will help guide any support or treatment you might need. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, including pervasive anhedonia, feelings of depression, hopelessness, and a sense of emotional detachment. They report persistent anxiety, worry about future stressors, and occasional panic-like sensations, alongside behavioral avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by irregular patterns, fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep. Cognitive concerns are evident, with noted difficulties in concentration and memory. Additionally, the patient experiences somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, likely stress-related.\n\nNotable patterns include concurrent depressive and anxious symptomatology, with episodes of irritability and emotional withdrawal. The presence of intrusive, distressing thoughts related to stressful events suggests possible ruminative or obsessive features. The patient also reports transient suicidal ideation without intent or plan, emphasizing a need for risk assessment.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety features, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and passive suicidal ideation. The expressed feelings of emotional numbness and dissociation (feeling detached from self and surroundings) may indicate dissociative experiences or other trauma-related phenomena.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include the reported fleeting suicidal thoughts under severe distress, emotional withdrawal, and heightened anxiety. While no active self-harm or substance misuse behaviors are identified, ongoing monitoring of suicidal ideation and emotional safety is warranted.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive and anxious symptomatology, sleep and cognitive disturbances, somatic complaints, and dissociative experiences. These findings suggest the need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to determine the presence of mood or anxiety disorders, dissociative features, and to evaluate suicide risk, informing appropriate treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a range of challenging symptoms that have significantly impacted your mood, thoughts, sleep, and overall sense of well-being. You're feeling <sym>depressed and hopeless</sym> at times, and you've mentioned <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed. Anxiety appears to be a prominent concern, with feelings of <sym>worry, nervousness, and occasional panic</sym>. You also describe difficulties with <sym>sleep patterns and concentration</sym>, along with somatic issues like <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym>. Additionally, you've shared feelings of <sym>emotional detachment and uncertainty about your identity and future</sym>. Despite these struggles, you're managing to keep going day by day, though it\u2019s clear that these symptoms are causing distress and impacting your quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder with anxious features and dissociative symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and impaired concentration</sym> aligns with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as excessive worry, agitation, and panic-like sensations, suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or features of anxious distress. The experiences of <sym>dissociation, feeling detached from oneself and surroundings</sym> point toward dissociative symptoms, which can sometimes accompany severe depression or anxiety. The sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, and fleeting <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further support the clinical picture. Overall, the symptom constellation indicates a major depressive episode with prominent anxious and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Seek a comprehensive clinical evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, particularly regarding suicidal ideation.\n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatment such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants with anxiolytic properties).\n3. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and establish regular monitoring of mood and safety.\n4. Explore strategies to improve sleep hygiene and manage <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n5. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and possibly a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist.\n6. Engage in supportive therapy to address feelings of <sym>detachment and identity concerns</sym>, and explore underlying stressors or trauma if relevant.",
