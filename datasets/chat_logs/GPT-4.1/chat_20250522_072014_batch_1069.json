Core concerns include persistent anhedonia (reported as feeling numb or indifferent), pervasive feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and social withdrawal evidenced by avoidance of social situations and difficulty forming close relationships. Elevated irritability and irritability-related mood dysregulation are noted, alongside sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and fragmented sleep pattern, contributing to subjective fatigue.\n\nCognitive symptoms include episodes of forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments, potentially linked to anxiety or mood disturbances. Recurrent ruminative thoughts concerning social embarrassment and self-evaluation suggest significant cognitive and emotional preoccupations. The patient reports episodic panic attacks, heightened social anxiety, and avoidance behaviors, consistent with social phobia or social anxiety disorder.\n\nAdditionally, there are indications of dissociative experiences\u2014feelings of derealization or depersonalization\u2014and occasional thoughts of self-harm when overwhelmed, which warrant careful monitoring for suicidality. No psychotic symptoms or substance misuse are reported, and there are no indications of psychosis or substance-related risks.\n\nPatterns of concern include comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms, social withdrawal, and sleep impairment, all of which significantly impair functioning. The patient's self-reported emotional distress, social avoidance, and passive suicidal ideation are notable and require further assessment for risk stratification.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation aligns with features characteristic of major depressive disorder with comorbid social anxiety disorder, accompanied by dissociative symptoms and sleep disturbance. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts necessitates ongoing risk evaluation. Further comprehensive assessment is recommended to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",

      "expected": "social_anxiety",
      "predicted": "The patient shares a complex picture of emotional distress and social difficulty. They experience persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and numbness</sym>, alongside increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Sleep disturbances, including <sym>fragmented sleep and reduced duration</sym>, contribute to ongoing fatigue. Cognitive concerns such as <sym>forgetfulness and disorientation</sym> and <sym>ruminative thoughts about social embarrassment</sym> further impact daily functioning. The patient reports episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, with occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. They do not endorse psychotic symptoms or substance misuse. Overall, their presentation indicates significant emotional and psychological distress affecting multiple areas of life, which warrants careful assessment and appropriate intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> with comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>social avoidance, fear of judgment, and physical symptoms in social situations</sym> suggest a comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>dissociative feelings such as derealization or depersonalization</sym> indicates dissociative features often seen with intense anxiety or mood episodes. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> further support this assessment. The absence of psychotic symptoms and substance misuse makes other diagnoses less likely at this stage.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnosis and evaluate risk, particularly regarding <sym>suicidality</sym>.\n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and social anxiety, and consider pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) if indicated.\n3. Address sleep difficulties with behavioral strategies or medical consultation.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies for managing anxiety and mood symptoms.\n5. Establish safety planning and regular follow-up to monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or worsening symptoms.",
