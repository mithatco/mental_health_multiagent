Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a standard questionnaire used to assess different areas of mental health, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. The purpose is to get a broad picture of how you're feeling and functioning, which can help guide any support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

Your experiences reflect significant distress and challenges in managing your mental health, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely generalized anxiety disorder) and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, characterized by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances, ongoing for at least two weeks.

The reported <sym>substance use</sym> (alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs) suggests a possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, potentially as maladaptive coping mechanisms for emotional distress. The physical complaints, such as <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>memory issues</sym>, may be related to the overall mood and anxiety symptoms or somatic manifestations of the psychological distress. Considering the constellation of symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> appears most fitting, though further assessments would be necessary for definitive conclusions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate a coordinated treatment plan that may include <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications) and <sym>psychotherapy</sym> (like cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address depression, anxiety, and substance use.  \n3. Explore behavioral health interventions focusing on <sym>coping skills</sym> for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as relapse prevention strategies for substance use.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and consider further assessment for underlying medical or sleep disorders if symptoms persist.  \n5. Encourage social support and development of a safety plan, especially considering thoughts of wishing to escape or not wake up, to ensure safety and emotional support.",

There are notable signs of cognitive and sleep disturbances, including memory impairment, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. The patient describes heightened anxiety characterized by worry, restlessness, and episodic panic attacks, alongside behavioral avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports somatic complaints such as unexplained aches and pains, which may be psychosomatic or indicative of somatic symptomatology. Intrusive thoughts and feelings of emotional detachment suggest possible obsessive or dissociative features. The sense of identity confusion and feelings of emotional disconnection point toward potential identity or depersonalization phenomena.\n\nSubstance use appears significant, with frequent alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and self-reported use of various substances without medical oversight, indicating potential substance misuse issues.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Passive suicidal ideation (e.g., wishing not to wake up) without active plans or intent.\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness.\n- Substance misuse as a maladaptive coping mechanism.\n- Cognitive disruptions that could impair daily functioning.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation is characterized by severe mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive impairment, somatic complaints, and substance use, warranting comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a complex mix of emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms that have been affecting your daily life. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, and increased <sym>irritability</sym>. You\u2019re also dealing with significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep has become disrupted, with <sym>difficulty sleeping</sym> and feeling <sym>non-restored</sym> in the mornings. You\u2019ve mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, and confusion about your identity and direction in life. Additionally, there\u2019s concern about <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like unexplained aches and pains, which seem to be intertwined with your emotional state. Your experiences reflect significant distress and challenges in managing your mental health, and it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely generalized anxiety disorder) and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, characterized by persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep disturbances, ongoing for at least two weeks. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, and episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, supports a comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported <sym>substance use</sym> (alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs) suggests a possible <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, potentially as maladaptive coping mechanisms for emotional distress. The physical complaints, such as <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>memory issues</sym>, may be related to the overall mood and anxiety symptoms or somatic manifestations of the psychological distress. Considering the constellation of symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> appears most fitting, though further assessments would be necessary for definitive conclusions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Refer for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate a coordinated treatment plan that may include <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications) and <sym>psychotherapy</sym> (like cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address depression, anxiety, and substance use.  \n3. Explore behavioral health interventions focusing on <sym>coping skills</sym> for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as relapse prevention strategies for substance use.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene education and consider further assessment for underlying medical or sleep disorders if symptoms persist.  \n5. Encourage social support and development of a safety plan, especially considering thoughts of wishing to escape or not wake up, to ensure safety and emotional support.",
