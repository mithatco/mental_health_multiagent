Consider initiating <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focused on social anxiety and depressive symptoms to develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3.

Physical manifestations such as anxiety-related somatic complaints and dissociative experiences are evident. The responses suggest moderate severity of social anxiety disorder, with associated mood disturbances, sleep disruption, and cognitive concerns. There are no current indications of psychosis, substance misuse, or active suicidal ideation. Continued assessment and a comprehensive diagnostic formulation are recommended to inform targeted interventions.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you experience significant anxiety related to social interactions, including feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and a tendency to <sym>avoid social gatherings</sym>. You also described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>being lost</sym> regarding your personal goals, along with some <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>low mood</sym>. Physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> occur, especially when you feel anxious, and you sometimes experience <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> during heightened anxiety. Despite these challenges, you do not report any thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, <sym>psychosis</sym>, or <sym>substance misuse</sym>. Your responses indicate that your main concerns revolve around social anxiety, mood disturbances, and associated physical and cognitive symptoms, which have impacted your daily functioning and social relationships. \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (Mild to Moderate)</med> (provisional).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>fear of social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social gatherings</sym>, and physical symptoms like <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>jitters</sym> strongly suggests <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of ongoing <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>lost</sym> indicate concurrent <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The chronic worry, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints further support a diagnosis involving <med>generalized anxiety</med>. The absence of psychotic features, substance use, or active suicidal ideation suggests that these symptoms are primarily internalizing and related to anxiety and mood regulation, without evidence of psychosis or substance-induced disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Consider initiating <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focused on social anxiety and depressive symptoms to develop coping strategies and challenge negative thought patterns.\n2. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3. Encourage engagement in social skills training or support groups to gradually reduce avoidance behaviors and improve social functioning.\n4. Conduct a comprehensive assessment for <med>comorbid conditions</med>, including a detailed suicide risk assessment and screening for possible <med>trauma-related disorders</med> if indicated.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and to adjust interventions as needed.",
