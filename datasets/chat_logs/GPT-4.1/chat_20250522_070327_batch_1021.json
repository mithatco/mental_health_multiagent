We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to better understand your current mental health. This is a set of questions that helps us look at different areas of your mental and emotional well-being over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. I'll ask you 23 questions, one at a time, and it's okay to take your time or let me know if you need a break. Are you ready to start with the first question?"

They report persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>overwhelm</sym>. Their sleep is severely disrupted, characterized by frequent awakenings and a lack of restorative rest, which seems to exacerbate their overall distress. They experience pervasive <sym>hyperarousal</sym> symptoms such as <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, particularly related to trauma triggers like driving. Cognitive disturbances include intrusive <sym>distressing memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, and dissociative feelings, such as <sym>feeling detached from themselves or their environment</sym>. The patient also endorses <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, paranoid-like beliefs about others reading their thoughts, and reports <sym>intrusive images</sym>. They describe difficulties with concentration and memory, along with a pattern of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including increased alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication\u2014which suggests maladaptive coping. <sym>Suicidal ideation</sym> is present, with thoughts of self-harm during moments of despair. Overall, these symptoms point to a complex presentation involving trauma-related, mood, and anxiety features, with significant impairments in functioning and safety concerns.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder (including panic disorder and generalized anxiety)</med>, <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, and possible dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including re-experiencing (intrusive memories, flashbacks, distressing images), avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and mood (feelings of detachment, hopelessness, dissociation), and hyperarousal (hypervigilance, panic attacks, sleep disturbances). The trauma appears to be related to a specific incident\u2014the accident\u2014and the symptoms have persisted for at least two weeks, impairing daily functioning. The presence of auditory hallucinations and paranoid beliefs suggests possible dissociative or psychotic features, which can occur in severe trauma-related presentations, especially with comorbid substance use. The pervasive depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and hopelessness, further support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use seems to serve as an avoidant or self-medicating behavior, complicating the clinical picture. Overall, the symptom constellation indicates a complex trauma response with mood and anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure (PE)</med>, to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Assess the need for pharmacological treatment, including antidepressants like <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, to target depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.  \n3. Conduct a comprehensive substance use assessment and consider integrated treatment, such as <med>motivational interviewing</med> or <med>addiction counseling</med>, to reduce reliance on substances.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and establish safety planning, including crisis resources and ongoing risk assessment.  \n5. Evaluate for dissociative symptoms and consider referral to a specialist if dissociation is severe or impairing.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses and coping strategies to enhance resilience and emotional regulation.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia (marked by diminished interest in activities), pervasive feelings of depression and hopelessness, and heightened irritability and anger. Sleep disturbance is prominent, characterized by frequent nocturnal awakenings, non-restorative sleep, and associated somatic complaints such as headaches and palpitations. The patient reports pronounced hyperarousal symptoms, including pervasive nervousness, feelings of on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors\u2014particularly related to driving and exposure to trauma triggers.\n\nCognitive and perceptual disturbances are evident, with reports of intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks, dissociative experiences (feeling detached from self and surroundings), and paranoid-like beliefs (feeling others can read thoughts). Psychotic-like phenomena, such as auditory hallucinations, are also endorsed, alongside concerns about being misunderstood and dismissed by others, indicating possible social withdrawal and interpersonal difficulties.\n\nSubstance use patterns reveal increased alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and self-medicating with over-the-counter medications and other substances, which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. Suicidal ideation is present, characterized by transient thoughts of self-harm during moments of overwhelm and despair, representing a significant risk factor.\n\nThe patient demonstrates pervasive distress, with notable features of dissociation, intrusive memories, and substance dependence, all of which warrant comprehensive assessment and intervention. The overall presentation suggests complex trauma with comorbid mood and anxiety symptoms, underscoring the need for a thorough diagnostic formulation and tailored treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex constellation of symptoms that indicate significant distress across multiple areas of mental health. They report persistent <sym>anhedonia</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>overwhelm</sym>. Their sleep is severely disrupted, characterized by frequent awakenings and a lack of restorative rest, which seems to exacerbate their overall distress. They experience pervasive <sym>hyperarousal</sym> symptoms such as <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, particularly related to trauma triggers like driving. Cognitive disturbances include intrusive <sym>distressing memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, and dissociative feelings, such as <sym>feeling detached from themselves or their environment</sym>. The patient also endorses <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym>, paranoid-like beliefs about others reading their thoughts, and reports <sym>intrusive images</sym>. They describe difficulties with concentration and memory, along with a pattern of <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including increased alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication\u2014which suggests maladaptive coping. <sym>Suicidal ideation</sym> is present, with thoughts of self-harm during moments of despair. Overall, these symptoms point to a complex presentation involving trauma-related, mood, and anxiety features, with significant impairments in functioning and safety concerns.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder (including panic disorder and generalized anxiety)</med>, <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, and possible dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including re-experiencing (intrusive memories, flashbacks, distressing images), avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and mood (feelings of detachment, hopelessness, dissociation), and hyperarousal (hypervigilance, panic attacks, sleep disturbances). The trauma appears to be related to a specific incident\u2014the accident\u2014and the symptoms have persisted for at least two weeks, impairing daily functioning. The presence of auditory hallucinations and paranoid beliefs suggests possible dissociative or psychotic features, which can occur in severe trauma-related presentations, especially with comorbid substance use. The pervasive depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and hopelessness, further support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use seems to serve as an avoidant or self-medicating behavior, complicating the clinical picture. Overall, the symptom constellation indicates a complex trauma response with mood and anxiety components.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</med> or <med>Prolonged Exposure (PE)</med>, to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Assess the need for pharmacological treatment, including antidepressants like <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, to target depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.  \n3. Conduct a comprehensive substance use assessment and consider integrated treatment, such as <med>motivational interviewing</med> or <med>addiction counseling</med>, to reduce reliance on substances.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and establish safety planning, including crisis resources and ongoing risk assessment.  \n5. Evaluate for dissociative symptoms and consider referral to a specialist if dissociation is severe or impairing.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about trauma responses and coping strategies to enhance resilience and emotional regulation.",
