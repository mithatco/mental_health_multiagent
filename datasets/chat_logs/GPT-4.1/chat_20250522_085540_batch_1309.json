Today, I'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various areas like mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly about your experiences. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot right now, with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> where you hear voices, and beliefs that your thoughts are being broadcasted. You also describe significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic episodes</sym>, feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations because of this. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> like feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, as well as cognitive difficulties such as memory problems. You mention <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and some <sym>substance use</sym>, which are serious concerns. It\u2019s understandable that managing these symptoms is overwhelming, and it\u2019s important to approach your care with compassion and urgency.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> with active psychotic features, complicated by <med>major depressive disorder</med> with suicidal ideation and significant anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>delusions</sym> (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read their mind), <sym>disorganized thinking</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>psychotic disorders</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> suggests a comorbid <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The symptoms of irritability, impulsivity, sleep disturbances, and increased energy may reflect <med>bipolar disorder</med>, but given the current presentation with prominent psychosis and mood symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>schizophrenia</med> with mood features is most consistent. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, but these are likely secondary to the primary psychotic and mood symptoms. The ongoing substance use may exacerbate symptoms and pose additional risks.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis plan due to active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>psychosis</sym>.\n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and initiation of antipsychotic medication to address <med>psychotic symptoms</med>.\n3. Consideration of a mood stabilizer or antidepressant to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Engagement in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), tailored to psychosis and mood disorders.\n5. Substance use assessment and support to reduce alcohol and tobacco use, which may interfere with treatment.\n6. Coordination with medical providers to evaluate and treat somatic complaints and ensure physical health is optimized.\n7. Ongoing monitoring for changes in symptoms, safety, and medication adherence.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to seek urgent clinical care to ensure your safety and to begin a comprehensive treatment plan.",

Notable features include pervasive feelings of depression, anhedonia, and hopelessness, alongside reports of auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and thought broadcasting, indicating active psychotic phenomena. The patient also reports persistent irritability, impulsivity, and sleep disturbances, with increased restlessness and difficulty sleeping despite feeling energized, suggestive of manic or hypomanic features. \n\nAdditionally, there are significant anxiety symptoms, including heightened tension, worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings. Somatic complaints, such as unexplained headaches and back pain, are present and may be psychosomatic in nature. The patient exhibits dissociative experiences, including depersonalization and derealization, and reports cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment and disorientation.\n\nSuicidal ideation is explicitly endorsed, representing a critical risk factor requiring immediate attention. The patient also reports substance use, including increased alcohol consumption and tobacco use, which may serve as maladaptive coping strategies. There is a history of unsupervised medication misuse, indicating potential issues with self-management and adherence.\n\nPatterns suggest a mood disorder with psychotic features, possibly bipolar disorder given the coexistence of depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms, compounded by prominent anxiety and dissociative features. The presence of active psychosis, suicidality, substance misuse, and dissociation constitutes significant clinical concerns and warrants urgent comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\nOverall, the patient's symptomatology indicates severe mood dysregulation, psychosis, and suicidality, with co-occurring anxiety and substance use issues, necessitating immediate safety planning and a multidisciplinary treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot right now, with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> where you hear voices, and beliefs that your thoughts are being broadcasted. You also describe significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic episodes</sym>, feelings of being <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations because of this. Additionally, you experience <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> like feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, as well as cognitive difficulties such as memory problems. You mention <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and some <sym>substance use</sym>, which are serious concerns. It\u2019s understandable that managing these symptoms is overwhelming, and it\u2019s important to approach your care with compassion and urgency.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> with active psychotic features, complicated by <med>major depressive disorder</med> with suicidal ideation and significant anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>delusions</sym> (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read their mind), <sym>disorganized thinking</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>psychotic disorders</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> suggests a comorbid <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The symptoms of irritability, impulsivity, sleep disturbances, and increased energy may reflect <med>bipolar disorder</med>, but given the current presentation with prominent psychosis and mood symptoms, a diagnosis of <med>schizophrenia</med> with mood features is most consistent. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, but these are likely secondary to the primary psychotic and mood symptoms. The ongoing substance use may exacerbate symptoms and pose additional risks.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis plan due to active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>psychosis</sym>.\n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and initiation of antipsychotic medication to address <med>psychotic symptoms</med>.\n3. Consideration of a mood stabilizer or antidepressant to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Engagement in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), tailored to psychosis and mood disorders.\n5. Substance use assessment and support to reduce alcohol and tobacco use, which may interfere with treatment.\n6. Coordination with medical providers to evaluate and treat somatic complaints and ensure physical health is optimized.\n7. Ongoing monitoring for changes in symptoms, safety, and medication adherence.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to seek urgent clinical care to ensure your safety and to begin a comprehensive treatment plan.",
