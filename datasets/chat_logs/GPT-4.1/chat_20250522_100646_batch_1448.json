I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a way for us to get a broad understanding of how you've been feeling and functioning over the past couple of weeks. This assessment helps identify areas that might need further attention and ensures we provide the best support possible. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different aspects of your mental health, and I will ask you each one in turn. Are you ready to begin?"

Overall, the presentation indicates a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, impacting their daily functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms fulfill criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and somatic complaints. The presence of significant anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, co-occurs frequently in depression.

The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal plan, or substance use suggests a primary depressive disorder with anxious features rather than a psychotic or substance-induced condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnosis and evaluate for any underlying medical conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) and psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacologic interventions.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or worsening mood symptoms, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Consider involving a primary care provider to assess for any medical factors that may influence mood or somatic symptoms.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including persistent anhedonia, pervasive feelings of hopelessness, and subjective sadness over the past two weeks. Sleep disturbance characterized by early morning awakening and difficulty maintaining sleep is reported, accompanied by fatigue and somatic complaints such as headaches and back pain, suggestive of psychophysiological stress. Cognitive impairment is evident through reported memory difficulties and occasional disorientation in familiar environments. Intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of guilt are noted, with no evidence of compulsive behaviors or compulsions. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are significant, marked by pervasive worry, heightened nervousness, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social contexts. The patient exhibits social withdrawal and emotional numbness, with diminished engagement in relationships and a sense of identity confusion or feeling lost. No current psychotic features or perceptual disturbances are reported, and substance use appears minimal or absent. Although thoughts of death are acknowledged, there are no active suicidal plans or intent.\n\n**Pattern Recognition and Clinical Significance:**\n- Core depressive features with co-occurring anxiety symptoms.\n- Sleep disruption and somatic complaints as somatic correlates of mood disorder.\n- Cognitive impairments and social withdrawal indicating functional impairment.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of guilt may exacerbate mood symptoms.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Endorsement of passive death ideation without active planning warrants monitoring.\n- Sleep disturbance and fatigue may increase risk for mood deterioration.\n- Social withdrawal and identity confusion suggest potential for worsening social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a constellation of depressive and anxiety symptoms characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep disturbance, intrusive thoughts, and social withdrawal. Cognitive and somatic complaints further impair functioning. While current suicidality appears passive without intent, ongoing assessment of risk is indicated. The presentation warrants a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, sleep, and cognitive concerns.",

They describe a <sym>weight on their chest</sym> and difficulty <sym>getting back to sleep</sym>, alongside <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as headaches and back pain, which seem to be stress-related. The patient also reports <sym>memory issues</sym> and occasional disorientation, along with ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym> characterized by <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance behavior</sym>. They describe <quote>feeling lost or unsure about what I want</quote> and have become <quote>withdrawn from friends and family</quote>. While they have <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym>, they deny <sym>active suicidal intent</sym>. Overall, the presentation indicates a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, impacting their daily functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms fulfill criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and somatic complaints. The presence of significant anxiety symptoms, such as <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym>, co-occurs frequently in depression. The symptoms have persisted for at least two weeks, with notable functional impairment. The absence of psychotic features, active suicidal plan, or substance use suggests a primary depressive disorder with anxious features rather than a psychotic or substance-induced condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric assessment to confirm diagnosis and evaluate for any underlying medical conditions contributing to symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as a combination of pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) and psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).  \n3. Address sleep difficulties through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, pharmacologic interventions.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts or worsening mood symptoms, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Consider involving a primary care provider to assess for any medical factors that may influence mood or somatic symptoms.",
