They report feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> most days, with episodic tearfulness and a sense of emotional heaviness. Alongside these mood symptoms, they experience significant <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>emotional reactivity</sym>, often snapping at others. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, leading to feelings of exhaustion. The patient also describes persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> about the future and <sym>panic episodes</sym> that evoke physical symptoms like racing heart. They have begun <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, avoiding situations that trigger anxiety or panic. Importantly, they endorse <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> of wanting to escape or not be here anymore, but without active plans or intent. Overall, the patient reports feeling overwhelmed, disconnected from themselves and others, and experiencing ongoing emotional distress that impacts their daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s symptoms align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>, including <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and social withdrawal. The presence of ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym> suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate an increased risk, although there are no active plans or intent reported. The symptoms are significantly impairing but do not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder or other specific mood or anxiety disorders at this time. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or other conditions supports this provisional diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms and assess suicide risk thoroughly.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an SSRI, alongside psychoeducation about mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer the patient for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, emotional regulation, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor sleep hygiene and develop strategies to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Establish a safety plan for managing passive suicidal thoughts, including ensuring the patient has immediate support and knows how to reach crisis services if needed.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of depressive and anxiety-related pathology. Key features include pervasive anhedonia (diminished interest in activities), persistent low mood, feelings of hopelessness, and episodic tearfulness over the past two weeks. There is notable irritability and increased emotional reactivity, alongside subjective reports of fatigue, sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, and non-restorative rest. The patient reports ongoing feelings of anxiety, worry, and occasional panic episodes, often accompanied by avoidance behaviors, particularly of social and crowded situations, suggestive of situational anxiety or panic symptoms.\n\nCognitive and perceptual functioning appear intact, with no reported hallucinations, delusional thoughts, or dissociative experiences. However, the patient endorses recurrent negative ruminative thoughts about the future and past, which may contribute to emotional distress. There is a sense of identity confusion or feeling \"lost\" regarding self-understanding and purpose, coupled with social withdrawal and loneliness, indicating impaired interpersonal functioning.\n\nSuicidal ideation is reported as passive, with thoughts of escape or not being here anymore, though without intent or active plans. No overt psychotic symptoms or substance misuse are evident. The patient denies use of illicit substances or medication misuse, and reports minimal alcohol consumption.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal a consistent presence of depressive and anxious symptomatology, with associated sleep and energy disturbances, heightened emotional reactivity, and social withdrawal. These symptoms are clinically significant and suggest a mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, potentially Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid anxiety features.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal thoughts and significant social isolation. While current suicidal intent is not indicated, ongoing monitoring is warranted given the reported hopelessness and passive death wishes.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms with associated functional impairment, sleep disturbance, and passive suicidality. Clinical focus should include assessing suicide risk, exploring underlying mood and anxiety disorder mechanisms, and developing a comprehensive treatment plan addressing emotional regulation, sleep hygiene, and social reintegration.",

However, some domains such as anger, energy/activity (mania), repetitive thoughts/behaviors, and cognitive function were only superficially addressed or not explored in depth. The questions did not systematically follow up on all symptom reports, leading to gaps in thoroughness. The exploration was adequate but lacked comprehensive coverage of all 23 questions with appropriate depth.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions generally aligned well with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting core symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The phrasing was mostly appropriate and clinically relevant. There was some slight vagueness in areas such as 'panic episodes' without probing for frequency or severity, and the therapist occasionally summarized symptoms without explicitly linking them to DSM-5 criteria. Nonetheless, the questions were appropriate for initial screening.",
        "consistency": "The conversation maintained a mostly logical flow, with questions following logically from previous disclosures. However, some transitions lacked smoothness\u2014for example, jumping from sleep issues directly into psychosis screening without explicitly connecting or clarifying the relevance. Additionally, certain areas like irritability and social withdrawal were touched upon but not deeply explored, which slightly disrupted the coherence of the assessment. Overall, the flow was acceptable but not seamless.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate, with GAD features and passive suicidal ideation aligns with the reported symptoms such as persistent low mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and passive suicidal thoughts. The clinician\u2019s reasoning was sound but somewhat superficial, lacking detailed linkage to specific DSM-5 criteria or differential diagnosis considerations. No systematic assessment of other mood or anxiety disorders was explicitly discussed, and some symptoms (e.g., irritability, social withdrawal) could suggest alternative or comorbid conditions that were not fully ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintained a professional, warm tone and acknowledged the patient\u2019s disclosures with validation and support. The opening statements emphasized safety and confidentiality, and the summary demonstrated understanding of the patient\u2019s distress. However, the responses were somewhat formal and lacked moments of deeper empathic engagement or personalized reflection that could strengthen rapport. Overall, the tone was appropriate but could be more warm and empathetic."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a solid foundation in assessing a broad range of DSM-5 symptom domains with appropriate clinical relevance. However, it lacked comprehensive coverage of all 23 questions, particularly in areas like anger, mania, and repetitive behaviors, which limits the depth of the assessment. The flow was generally logical but occasionally abrupt, and the diagnostic justification, while reasonable, did not fully explore differential diagnoses or explicitly link symptoms to DSM-5 criteria. Empathy was present but could be enhanced with more personalized and emotionally attuned responses. Overall, this is a competent assessment that would benefit from more thorough exploration, better integration of symptom linkages, and more nuanced empathic engagement to reach a higher score across all criteria.",

      "predicted": "The patient presents with a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and a lack of interest in activities they previously enjoyed, such as social outings and entertainment. They report feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> most days, with episodic tearfulness and a sense of emotional heaviness. Alongside these mood symptoms, they experience significant <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>emotional reactivity</sym>, often snapping at others. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulty falling and staying asleep, leading to feelings of exhaustion. The patient also describes persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> about the future and <sym>panic episodes</sym> that evoke physical symptoms like racing heart. They have begun <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, avoiding situations that trigger anxiety or panic. Importantly, they endorse <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> of wanting to escape or not be here anymore, but without active plans or intent. Overall, the patient reports feeling overwhelmed, disconnected from themselves and others, and experiencing ongoing emotional distress that impacts their daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s symptoms align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>, including <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and social withdrawal. The presence of ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, worry, and <sym>panic-like episodes</sym> suggest comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate an increased risk, although there are no active plans or intent reported. The symptoms are significantly impairing but do not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder or other specific mood or anxiety disorders at this time. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or other conditions supports this provisional diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of symptoms and assess suicide risk thoroughly.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, such as an SSRI, alongside psychoeducation about mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer the patient for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address negative thought patterns, emotional regulation, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor sleep hygiene and develop strategies to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Establish a safety plan for managing passive suicidal thoughts, including ensuring the patient has immediate support and knows how to reach crisis services if needed.",
