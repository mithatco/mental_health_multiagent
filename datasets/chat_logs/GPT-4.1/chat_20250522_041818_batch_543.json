Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health symptoms across different domains.

The process involves asking you 23 questions about your experiences over the past two weeks. Please answer honestly and openly, and remember that your responses are confidential.

The patient reports anhedonia, low mood, and feelings of hopelessness, indicative of comorbid depressive features. There is notable social withdrawal, difficulty forming connections, and feelings of loneliness, which may be exacerbating the mood disturbance.\n\nPatterns observed include persistent anxious rumination, intrusive negative social thoughts, and transient dissociative experiences under social stress. The patient exhibits physical manifestations of anxiety, such as headaches and stomachaches, often linked to heightened social worry. Cognitive symptoms include difficulty with social cognition and self-esteem, along with occasional forgetfulness related to anxiety.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance encompass social anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, and associated cognitive and somatic complaints. No current evidence suggests psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation. Risk factors include social avoidance behaviors and emotional distress, which may impact overall functioning and quality of life.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a constellation of social anxiety symptoms compounded by depressive features, with significant functional impairment related to social withdrawal and negative self-appraisal. Further assessment is warranted to clarify diagnostic considerations, evaluate severity, and formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",

You feel <sym>lonely and disconnected</sym> from others and often find yourself <sym>doubting who you are or what you want in life</sym>. Despite these difficulties, you do not have thoughts of self-harm or hallucinations. Your experiences suggest a complex picture of social anxiety with comorbid depressive features, impacting your emotional well-being and social functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>fear and avoidance of social situations</sym>, <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic in social contexts</sym>, and physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym> are characteristic of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loneliness</sym> indicate significant depressive features. The intrusive <sym>negative thoughts</sym> and cognitive patterns further support a depressive component. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation suggests these conditions are the primary concerns at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Consider a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.\n2. Initiate evidence-based <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> targeting social anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3. Explore pharmacotherapy options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<med>SSRIs</med>), which are effective for both <med>social anxiety</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n4. Develop coping strategies to manage physical symptoms, such as relaxation techniques and mindfulness.\n5. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to reduce avoidance behaviors.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor progress and adjust treatment plans as needed.",
