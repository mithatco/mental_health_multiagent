Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything you share is confidential, and we're here to create a safe space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question, and you can respond in your own words, describing your experiences. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

Additionally, you mention <sym>cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and feeling lost</sym>, along with <sym>physical symptoms like headaches and muscle tension</sym>. These symptoms have clearly impacted your daily functioning and emotional well-being, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and panic-like episodes</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The symptoms of <sym>dissociation or feeling disconnected</sym> may reflect dissociative experiences often associated with severe anxiety or mood disturbances. The cognitive and somatic complaints, such as <sym>forgetfulness, headaches, and muscle tension</sym>, further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. While there are no indications of psychosis or suicidal ideation at this time, ongoing monitoring is necessary given the severity of symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including standardized scales for depression and anxiety, to confirm diagnoses and determine severity.\n2. Consider initiating pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, combined with psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, short-term sleep aids under medical supervision.\n4. Monitor for any worsening of symptoms or emergence of suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan.\n5. Explore interventions for dissociative experiences if they persist or interfere with functioning.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders to foster understanding and engagement in treatment.\n7. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and further evaluation if symptoms remain severe or worsen.",

Key concerns include persistent anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and pervasive anxiety, including symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., excessive worry, restlessness, difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts). The patient reports episodes of panic-like symptoms characterized by racing heart, shortness of breath, and fear of losing control, alongside avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations.\n\nNotable patterns include:\n- Mood symptoms such as anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Anxiety symptoms encompassing general worry, panic episodes, and avoidance.\n- Sleep disturbances marked by difficulty falling asleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings, despite not feeling overly fatigued during the day.\n- Cognitive concerns, such as increased forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments.\n- Somatic complaints including headaches and muscle tension.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and compulsive checking behaviors suggestive of ruminative or obsessive tendencies.\n- Feelings of dissociation or detachment, which may indicate dissociative experiences or heightened emotional distress.\n- No current evidence of psychotic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or substance misuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and dissociative experiences. The patient's social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection warrant attention for possible social or interpersonal impairment.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs:\n- Feelings of hopelessness and pervasive anxiety may increase risk for suicidal ideation, although none are explicitly reported.\n- Dissociative symptoms and panic episodes require monitoring for escalation.\n- Absence of self-harm thoughts at present reduces immediate risk but warrants ongoing assessment.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood dysregulation, high levels of anxiety, somatic complaints, cognitive disturbances, and dissociative symptoms. These findings suggest the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and targeted intervention planning to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, alongside ongoing risk assessment.",

      "expected": "anxiety",
      "predicted": "You have shared a range of distressing symptoms over the past two weeks, including <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>significant anxiety and worry</sym>. You also experience <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> with difficulty falling asleep and waking during the night, and feelings of <sym>detachment or disconnection from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Additionally, you mention <sym>cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and feeling lost</sym>, along with <sym>physical symptoms like headaches and muscle tension</sym>. These symptoms have clearly impacted your daily functioning and emotional well-being, and I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, and panic-like episodes</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The symptoms of <sym>dissociation or feeling disconnected</sym> may reflect dissociative experiences often associated with severe anxiety or mood disturbances. The cognitive and somatic complaints, such as <sym>forgetfulness, headaches, and muscle tension</sym>, further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. While there are no indications of psychosis or suicidal ideation at this time, ongoing monitoring is necessary given the severity of symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including standardized scales for depression and anxiety, to confirm diagnoses and determine severity.\n2. Consider initiating pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, combined with psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting both mood and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, short-term sleep aids under medical supervision.\n4. Monitor for any worsening of symptoms or emergence of suicidal ideation, and develop a safety plan.\n5. Explore interventions for dissociative experiences if they persist or interfere with functioning.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders to foster understanding and engagement in treatment.\n7. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and further evaluation if symptoms remain severe or worsen.",
