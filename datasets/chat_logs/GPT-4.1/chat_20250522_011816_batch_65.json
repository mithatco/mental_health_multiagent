Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various mental health domains based on your experiences over the past two weeks.

The process involves me asking you a series of 23 questions, and I would like you to answer as openly and accurately as you can, describing your feelings and experiences in your own words. There are no right or wrong answers. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

The persistent worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of feeling detached or observing oneself from outside the body, along with difficulty identifying oneself or understanding personal goals, suggest dissociative features. The physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches, may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress, but given the emotional and cognitive symptoms, a primary mood and anxiety disorder diagnosis is most appropriate. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for careful monitoring and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for suicidality, and consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management if appropriate.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, and explore interventions for dissociative experiences.  \n3. Develop a safety plan and consider regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.  \n4. Evaluate for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to somatic symptoms, and collaborate with medical providers as needed.",

There is evidence of significant anxiety features characterized by persistent worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances are notable, with reports of both hypersomnia and irregular sleep patterns, alongside concentration and memory impairments. The patient reports intrusive thoughts related to stress and experiences dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization. Physical complaints include frequent headaches and stomachaches, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress. Although there are no indications of psychotic symptoms or substance abuse, the patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without specific plans or intent.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with evidence of social withdrawal and emotional dysregulation. The patient's self-reports suggest a sense of existential confusion and disconnection from identity and relationships. Risk factors include expressed thoughts of self-harm, emotional distress, and functional impairment due to mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\nIn summary, the patient's presentation includes features consistent with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, with dissociative experiences and somatic complaints contributing to the clinical picture. The current symptomatology warrants further comprehensive assessment to determine appropriate diagnostic clarification and intervention planning, with particular attention to suicidal ideation and functional impairment.",

You've also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>. Your sleep patterns have been irregular, sometimes sleeping more than usual but feeling tired, and other times lying awake feeling restless. You are struggling with <sym>concentration</sym> and <sym>memory problems</sym>, intrusive <sym>stressful thoughts</sym>, and episodes of dissociation where you feel disconnected from yourself. Physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches are also present, which seem linked to your emotional distress. You mentioned feeling <quote>lost</quote> and uncertain about yourself and your relationships, and you've been withdrawing socially. Although you haven't engaged in substance use or risky behaviors, you have expressed some <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. These symptoms appear to be affecting your daily life significantly, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share this with me.  \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and dissociative features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant social withdrawal, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors point toward <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of feeling detached or observing oneself from outside the body, along with difficulty identifying oneself or understanding personal goals, suggest dissociative features. The physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches, may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress, but given the emotional and cognitive symptoms, a primary mood and anxiety disorder diagnosis is most appropriate. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> underscores the need for careful monitoring and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for suicidality, and consider involving a psychiatrist for medication management if appropriate.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, and explore interventions for dissociative experiences.  \n3. Develop a safety plan and consider regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and treatment response.  \n4. Evaluate for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to somatic symptoms, and collaborate with medical providers as needed.",
