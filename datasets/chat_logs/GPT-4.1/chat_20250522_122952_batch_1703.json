This assessment helps us get a broad view of your mental health over the past two weeks across different areas. It's designed to be confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share honestly. The questionnaire has 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. We'll go through each question one by one, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, as well as physical sensations like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>. Your anxiety is also prominent, with <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>. Your recent engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming emotions.

Also consider transient <med>dissociative symptoms</med> and <med>intrusive thoughts</med> related to anxiety and mood dysregulation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>non-prescribed medication intake</sym> suggest <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to mood and anxiety symptoms.

The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive treatment approach, as the patient's safety and stabilization are priorities given the suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment to evaluate the risk of <sym>suicidal behavior</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Referral to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and initiation of evidence-based <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy).  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or other antidepressant, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address substance use by connecting with addiction services or support groups to reduce <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and support systems.  \n6.

Key findings include pervasive anhedonia and depressed mood over the past two weeks, accompanied by feelings of hopelessness, persistent irritability, and social withdrawal, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. The patient also reports significant anxiety features, including excessive worry, hypervigilance, panic episodes with physiologic symptoms such as tachycardia and dyspnea, and avoidance behaviors centered around anxious triggers, indicating prominent anxiety pathology.\n\nAdditional features include sleep disturbances marked by difficulty maintaining sleep, episodic forgetfulness and cognitive concerns, intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors, and transient derealization experiences, which may signal dissociative phenomena or heightened psychological distress. The patient reports recent engagement in risky activities and increased substance use\u2014specifically alcohol consumption and tobacco use\u2014as maladaptive coping strategies. Furthermore, there are indications of self-harm ideation, with recent thoughts of mortality, raising concern for suicidality.\n\nNotable patterns include mood instability, heightened irritability, impulsivity, and an overall sense of emotional numbness and disconnection from self and others. The patient\u2019s substance use and non-prescribed medication intake serve as potential risk factors for exacerbation of mental health difficulties and possible substance use disorder.\n\nThe clinical significance centers on the coexistence of mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociative experiences, suicidal ideation, and substance misuse, all of which require urgent further assessment for potential comorbid diagnoses such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, dissociative phenomena, and substance use disorder. Immediate safety evaluation is warranted given the reported suicidal thoughts.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging and complex picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re experiencing significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>, as well as physical sensations like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym>. Your anxiety is also prominent, with <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you mentioned experiencing <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>self-harm ideation</sym>. Your recent engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> suggest attempts to cope with these overwhelming emotions. Given the depth of your distress, especially your thoughts of <quote>ending it all</quote>, it\u2019s crucial to prioritize your safety and get the support you need.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with features of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol and Tobacco)</med>. Also consider transient <med>dissociative symptoms</med> and <med>intrusive thoughts</med> related to anxiety and mood dysregulation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>non-prescribed medication intake</sym> suggest <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which may be contributing to mood and anxiety symptoms. The transient feelings of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym> point toward dissociative phenomena, possibly related to heightened stress or trauma-related responses. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive treatment approach, as the patient's safety and stabilization are priorities given the suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment to evaluate the risk of <sym>suicidal behavior</sym> and develop a safety plan.  \n2. Referral to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and initiation of evidence-based <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy).  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or other antidepressant, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address substance use by connecting with addiction services or support groups to reduce <sym>alcohol</sym> and <sym>tobacco</sym> use.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, emphasizing coping strategies and support systems.  \n6. Arrange for follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",
