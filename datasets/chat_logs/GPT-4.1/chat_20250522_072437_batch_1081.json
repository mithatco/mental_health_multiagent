This assessment is designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other areas. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions, and I will ask each one in turn.

      "content": "You have shared that you are experiencing a range of difficult feelings and thoughts over the past couple of weeks. You describe persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym>, along with <sym>trouble sleeping, waking very early and feeling exhausted</sym>. You also mention <sym>difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Additionally, you report <sym>ongoing worry, racing thoughts, avoidance of social situations, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed <quote>feeling pretty lost and unsure of who you are or what you want</quote>, with some <sym>passive thoughts about death but no plans to harm yourself</sym>. It sounds like you are going through a very challenging time, feeling overwhelmed and isolated, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate to severe, with anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness</sym> that have lasted for at least two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances, concentration problems, and feelings of disconnection</sym>. The presence of <sym>worry, racing thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms</sym> indicates significant anxiety symptoms co-occurring with depression. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> without current active suicidal plans suggest a need for careful safety assessment but do not meet criteria for active suicidal ideation. The symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>anxious distress</med>, which is common when anxiety symptoms are prominent alongside depression. The dissociative or depersonalization experiences further support the severity of emotional distress but do not suggest a primary dissociative or psychotic disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment to evaluate the risk of suicide or self-harm and develop a safety plan if needed. \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment for depression, such as pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) combined with psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy). \n3. Address anxiety symptoms through either medication management or targeted therapy techniques, such as anxiety management strategies and relaxation techniques. \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen. \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing the importance of social support and routine self-care. \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

There is a notable mood disturbance characterized by persistent sadness and thoughts of death without current suicidal intent, alongside significant sleep disturbances (early awakening and non-restorative sleep) and concentration difficulties. The patient also reports feelings of disconnection from self and others, suggestive of dissociative or depersonalization experiences.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident, with reports of pervasive worry, racing thoughts, and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, indicating possible social or generalized anxiety components. Somatic complaints, such as headaches and stomachaches, are also reported without clear medical etiology.\n\nThe patient exhibits social withdrawal, reduced interest in activities, and diminished engagement with relationships, which may further impact functioning. No evidence of psychosis, substance abuse, or recent risky behaviors is noted. Risk factors include passive thoughts of death and feelings of being misunderstood or overwhelmed, warranting careful assessment of suicide risk, even in the absence of active plans.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Predominant depressive symptoms with affective and cognitive components.\n- Significant anxiety features, including worry and avoidance.\n- Sleep and concentration impairments.\n- Dissociative experiences and feelings of identity confusion.\n- Social withdrawal and anhedonia.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Focus:**\n- Mood disorder (potential major depressive disorder)\n- Anxiety disorder (possibly comorbid generalized or social anxiety)\n- Dissociative phenomena or depersonalization\n- Suicidal ideation risk assessment\n- Sleep disturbance management\n- Social functioning and interpersonal relationships\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Persistent hopelessness and passive death thoughts\n- Feelings of disconnection from self and others\n- Sleep impairment and fatigue\n- Social withdrawal\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe patient demonstrates significant depressive symptomatology with concurrent anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbance, and dissociative experiences.

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a range of difficult feelings and thoughts over the past couple of weeks. You describe persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym>, along with <sym>trouble sleeping, waking very early and feeling exhausted</sym>. You also mention <sym>difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings</sym>. Additionally, you report <sym>ongoing worry, racing thoughts, avoidance of social situations, and physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed <quote>feeling pretty lost and unsure of who you are or what you want</quote>, with some <sym>passive thoughts about death but no plans to harm yourself</sym>. It sounds like you are going through a very challenging time, feeling overwhelmed and isolated, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate to severe, with anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness</sym> that have lasted for at least two weeks, along with <sym>sleep disturbances, concentration problems, and feelings of disconnection</sym>. The presence of <sym>worry, racing thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms</sym> indicates significant anxiety symptoms co-occurring with depression. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> without current active suicidal plans suggest a need for careful safety assessment but do not meet criteria for active suicidal ideation. The symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>anxious distress</med>, which is common when anxiety symptoms are prominent alongside depression. The dissociative or depersonalization experiences further support the severity of emotional distress but do not suggest a primary dissociative or psychotic disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment to evaluate the risk of suicide or self-harm and develop a safety plan if needed. \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment for depression, such as pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants) combined with psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy). \n3. Address anxiety symptoms through either medication management or targeted therapy techniques, such as anxiety management strategies and relaxation techniques. \n4. Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication management and to a sleep specialist if sleep disturbances persist or worsen. \n5. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing the importance of social support and routine self-care. \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
