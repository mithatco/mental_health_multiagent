We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This helps us understand different areas that might be affecting your well-being. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions that cover various aspects of mental health, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I encourage you to answer honestly about how you've been feeling. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

There is evidence of heightened anxiety (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggesting comorbid anxiety features. Sleep disturbances are prominent, characterized by insomnia and fragmented sleep (Q5, Q15), alongside cognitive disturbances such as memory fog and disorientation (Q16). The patient reports derealization experiences (Q19) and a subjective sense of identity confusion (Q20), raising concerns about dissociative symptoms. \n\nRisk factors include active suicidal ideation (Q12), substance misuse involving alcohol (Q22), tobacco (Q23), and non-prescribed drug use (Q24). The patient also reports physical symptoms, such as headaches and body aches (Q10), which are possibly psychosomatic or stress-related. Social withdrawal and emotional disconnection (Q21) further compound the clinical picture.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits multidimensional symptomatology with prominent mood and anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and substance use, all of which suggest a potential mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and substance use issues. The presence of active suicidal thoughts necessitates urgent safety assessment. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to clarify diagnosis, severity, and appropriate treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. It\u2019s clear that you're experiencing a range of difficult feelings, including <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that often feels overwhelming. You've mentioned <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, <sym>cognitive fog</sym>, and episodes of <sym>derealization</sym>, which can make everyday life feel uncertain or disconnected. Additionally, you're struggling with <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and engaging in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope. It\u2019s understandable that these feelings and behaviors are very challenging, and reaching out for help is a brave and important step.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>depressed mood</sym> (e.g., <quote>nothing excites me anymore</quote>, <quote>nothing's going to get better</quote>), <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>ruminating thoughts</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive symptoms such as <sym>memory fog</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym> indicate dissociative features, which can occur with severe depression and anxiety. The active <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> further complicate the clinical picture, pointing to additional risks and the need for urgent intervention. Overall, these symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid anxiety and substance use issues.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment immediately to evaluate the risk of <sym>suicide</sym> and establish a safety plan.  \n2. Initiate a psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider medication management for <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>substance use</med>.  \n3. Provide or refer for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>Trauma-Informed Therapy</med>, to address mood, anxiety, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n4. Offer support for <sym>substance use</sym>, including referral to specialized addiction services if appropriate.  \n5. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and response to treatment, adjusting plans as needed.",
