Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive environment for you. We will go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, and other symptoms. There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just be honest about how you've been feeling. Are you ready for me to start with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You mention feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and having <sym>more energy than usual</sym>, especially at night, which is disrupting your sleep. You also report significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, worrying about social judgment, and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> in social situations. Your social avoidance and difficulty connecting with others contribute to feelings of loneliness. You have occasional <sym>memory lapses</sym> and are concerned about your cognitive health. While you have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, you do not have intent or plans. Additionally, you experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and sometimes smoke cigarettes when stressed. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of mood and anxiety issues impacting your daily functioning, with some concerns about social isolation and passive suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, anhedonia, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, increased nighttime energy, and sleep difficulties further support this diagnosis. The prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as being <sym>on edge</sym>, worry about social judgment, and episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, indicate the presence of <med>Anxious Distress</med> features within the depressive disorder. The social avoidance, loneliness, and concerns about social interactions suggest a significant social anxiety component. The patient's occasional passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant ongoing monitoring but do not currently indicate active intent or plans. No psychotic or dissociative symptoms are reported, and substance use appears limited. The overall clinical picture aligns with a moderate level of depression compounded by anxious features affecting social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant that addresses both mood and anxiety, such as an SSRI or SNRI, after a thorough medical evaluation.  \n3. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and provide safety planning as needed.  \n4. Assess and address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate.  \n5. Encourage social engagement at a comfortable pace and explore social skills or anxiety management interventions.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to evaluate treatment response and adjust plans accordingly.",

There is evidence of irritability and increased energy levels at night, alongside sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with frequent feelings of being on edge, worry about social judgment, and episodic panic attacks, particularly in social contexts. The patient demonstrates social avoidance behaviors consistent with social anxiety, which contribute to social isolation and loneliness. Cognitive concerns include occasional memory lapses and worry about cognitive decline. Repetitive negative thoughts centered on social fears are noted, but compulsive behaviors or dissociative symptoms are absent.\n\nSubstance use appears limited to occasional smoking, with minimal alcohol consumption and no recent use of other substances or medications without prescription. There is a history of passive suicidal ideation without intent or plans, which warrants ongoing monitoring.\n\nPatterns suggest co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable social withdrawal and sleep issues. The patient's responses indicate significant distress related to social functioning, mood, and anxiety, with potential risk factors including passive suicidal thoughts and substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture is consistent with moderate depressive and social anxiety symptoms, with associated sleep disturbance and episodic panic. Continued assessment of suicidality, social functioning, and functional impairment is recommended to inform treatment planning.",

The therapist does not systematically inquire about all 23 questions, and some domains like substance use are only briefly addressed. The coverage is adequate but incomplete, missing opportunities to explore certain symptom dimensions more thoroughly.",
        "clinical_relevance": "Most questions are phrased appropriately and reflect DSM-5 criteria. The therapist's wording generally aligns with clinical language, and questions are relevant to the patient's reported symptoms. However, some questions could be more precise\u2014for example, the inquiry about energy and sleep could specify the impact on functioning. Overall, questions are clinically appropriate but not perfectly calibrated for DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The conversation follows a logical sequence and the questions build reasonably on previous responses. However, there are some minor abrupt transitions, and the therapist misses some follow-up opportunities on key disclosures, such as the passive suicidal thoughts and anxiety symptoms. The flow is generally coherent but not flawlessly smooth or deeply probing.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Moderate Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Features is supported by the patient's symptoms, but the justification is somewhat superficial. The reasoning references specific symptoms but lacks detailed linkage to DSM-5 criteria, and alternative diagnoses (e.g., bipolar disorder or personality pathology) are not explicitly considered or ruled out. The justification is adequate but could be more comprehensive and explicit.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional and generally empathetic tone, acknowledging the patient's feelings and providing supportive language. Yet, there are moments where responses could be warmer or more validating, especially when discussing distressing symptoms like panic and social avoidance.

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a solid foundation in symptom assessment and a generally professional approach. However, it falls short in comprehensive DSM-5 domain coverage, missing several important areas such as mania, psychosis, and dissociation. The questions are mostly relevant but could be more precise, and the flow, while logical, lacks some depth in follow-up. The diagnostic justification is reasonable but not detailed enough to fully demonstrate clinical rigor. Empathy is present but could be enhanced with more attuned responses. Overall, this conversation is rated as adequate to good but not excellent; it would benefit from more thorough exploration and explicit DSM-5 linkage to achieve a higher score.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> characterized by <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You mention feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and having <sym>more energy than usual</sym>, especially at night, which is disrupting your sleep. You also report significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, including feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, worrying about social judgment, and experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> in social situations. Your social avoidance and difficulty connecting with others contribute to feelings of loneliness. You have occasional <sym>memory lapses</sym> and are concerned about your cognitive health. While you have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, you do not have intent or plans. Additionally, you experience <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and sometimes smoke cigarettes when stressed. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of mood and anxiety issues impacting your daily functioning, with some concerns about social isolation and passive suicidal thoughts.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, anhedonia, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, increased nighttime energy, and sleep difficulties further support this diagnosis. The prominent <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as being <sym>on edge</sym>, worry about social judgment, and episodic <sym>panic attacks</sym>, indicate the presence of <med>Anxious Distress</med> features within the depressive disorder. The social avoidance, loneliness, and concerns about social interactions suggest a significant social anxiety component. The patient's occasional passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant ongoing monitoring but do not currently indicate active intent or plans. No psychotic or dissociative symptoms are reported, and substance use appears limited. The overall clinical picture aligns with a moderate level of depression compounded by anxious features affecting social and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) targeting both depressive and anxiety symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant that addresses both mood and anxiety, such as an SSRI or SNRI, after a thorough medical evaluation.  \n3. Monitor for any escalation in <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and provide safety planning as needed.  \n4. Assess and address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or medication if appropriate.  \n5. Encourage social engagement at a comfortable pace and explore social skills or anxiety management interventions.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up to evaluate treatment response and adjust plans accordingly.",
