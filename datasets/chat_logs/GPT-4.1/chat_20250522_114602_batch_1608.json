I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to help us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. This assessment covers different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and others, and your responses will help guide any further steps we might consider. Please know that everything you share remains confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The process involves me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and describe your experience in your own words. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You mention feeling <sym>indifferent or lacking interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loneliness</sym>. You also experience <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially related to social situations, which leads you to <sym>avoid social gatherings</sym>. Sleep has been difficult, with trouble falling and staying asleep due to racing thoughts. You sometimes have <sym>fleeting thoughts of escape or ending things</sym>, but no plans or intent. While you haven't experienced <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusional thoughts</sym>, you do notice intrusive thoughts about past social embarrassments. Overall, these symptoms seem to impact your mood, social functioning, and sleep, leading to feelings of isolation and distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>worry about social judgment</sym>, and <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>panic episodes</sym>, along with pervasive worry, further support an anxiety component. Sleep disturbance due to racing thoughts is common in depression and anxiety. The brief suicidal thoughts are concerning and warrant careful monitoring. There are no psychotic features or substance use issues noted. This combination of mood and anxiety symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid social anxiety symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety, including risk assessment for suicidality.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and social anxiety, and evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants).  \n3. Develop a safety plan to address fleeting suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and coping strategies.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and any emerging concerns.",

Sleep disturbances related to ruminative and worry-driven thoughts are prominent. The absence of psychotic features, substance misuse, or persistent self-harm behaviors suggests a focus on internalizing symptoms. The reports of fleeting suicidal thoughts underscore the importance of ongoing risk assessment and therapeutic engagement targeting mood, anxiety, and social functioning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging feelings and behaviors. You mention feeling <sym>indifferent or lacking interest in activities you once enjoyed</sym>, along with <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>loneliness</sym>. You also experience <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, especially related to social situations, which leads you to <sym>avoid social gatherings</sym>. Sleep has been difficult, with trouble falling and staying asleep due to racing thoughts. You sometimes have <sym>fleeting thoughts of escape or ending things</sym>, but no plans or intent. While you haven't experienced <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusional thoughts</sym>, you do notice intrusive thoughts about past social embarrassments. Overall, these symptoms seem to impact your mood, social functioning, and sleep, leading to feelings of isolation and distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>social avoidance</sym>, <sym>worry about social judgment</sym>, and <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> suggests comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>panic episodes</sym>, along with pervasive worry, further support an anxiety component. Sleep disturbance due to racing thoughts is common in depression and anxiety. The brief suicidal thoughts are concerning and warrant careful monitoring. There are no psychotic features or substance use issues noted. This combination of mood and anxiety symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder with comorbid social anxiety symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety, including risk assessment for suicidality.  \n2. Consider evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression and social anxiety, and evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants).  \n3. Develop a safety plan to address fleeting suicidal thoughts, including emergency contacts and coping strategies.  \n4. Encourage regular sleep hygiene practices and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and any emerging concerns.",
