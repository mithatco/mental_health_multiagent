This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks, covering emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. We will go through 23 questions, one at a time.

Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, potentially including antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, tailored to the patient's specific symptom profile.  \n4. Develop a structured <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> plan to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing that these are treatable conditions.  \n6.

They report pervasive anxiety, characterized by chronic worry, restlessness, and occasional panic episodes, particularly in crowded or overwhelming situations. Sleep disturbances are evident, with both insomnia and hypersomnia reported, contributing to daytime fatigue and impaired functioning. Cognitive concerns include difficulty concentrating and memory issues, alongside recurrent negative ruminative thoughts.\n\nSomatic complaints such as frequent headaches and stomachaches appear to be stress-related, and the patient expresses feelings of emotional and social withdrawal, with diminished engagement in relationships and social activities. They acknowledge thoughts of self-harm, which, although not acted upon, represent an important risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, with emotional numbness, irritability, and dissociation-like experiences (feeling disconnected) also noted. The patient denies psychotic experiences, substance misuse, or significant risky behaviors.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and possible comorbid dissociative features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful assessment for safety. No immediate evidence of substance dependency or psychosis is indicated, but ongoing evaluation of risk factors is advised.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits a complex clinical picture characterized by mood dysregulation, anxiety symptoms, cognitive impairment, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal, necessitating a comprehensive, trauma-informed treatment approach.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, leading to feelings of numbness and emotional detachment. You've also been overwhelmed by <sym>chronic worry, anxiety, and restlessness</sym>, with occasional <sym>panic episodes</sym> especially in crowded or stressful situations. Sleep difficulties, including both <sym>insomnia and hypersomnia</sym>, have contributed to ongoing fatigue and a sense of exhaustion during the day. You\u2019ve noticed problems with concentration and memory, alongside intrusive <sym>repetitive negative thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you experience physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches that seem stress-related, and you\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>. Importantly, you\u2019ve had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> without acting on them, which is concerning and warrants ongoing attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic issues, and I want to acknowledge the distress this has caused you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> features and possible <med>dissociative symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of hopelessness align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive worry, difficulty relaxing, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reported experiences of feeling disconnected, such as <sym>feeling detached from oneself or the environment</sym> and episodes of feeling outside of reality, indicate <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. Cognitive issues like concentration problems and intrusive negative thoughts further support this multifaceted clinical picture. The presence of thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> emphasizes the need for safety monitoring. These symptoms collectively point to a mood disorder with prominent anxiety features, compounded by dissociative experiences, which are common in complex presentations of depression and anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment focusing on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>self-harm</sym> to ensure safety.  \n2. Initiate or continue evidence-based <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address depressive and anxious symptoms, and explore trauma-informed approaches if dissociative symptoms persist.  \n3. Consider a psychiatric evaluation for medication management, potentially including antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents, tailored to the patient's specific symptom profile.  \n4. Develop a structured <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> plan to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, emphasizing that these are treatable conditions.  \n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",
