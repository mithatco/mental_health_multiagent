You have experienced <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about hurting yourself, indicating serious emotional pain and risk.

Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, including risk of self-harm, and establish safety plans if indicated.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), after thorough evaluation and discussion of benefits and side effects.  \n4. Refer to a psychiatrist or primary care provider for further evaluation of sleep disturbances and somatic complaints, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions.  \n5. Encourage regular routines, social engagement, and stress management techniques to support recovery.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety concerns.",

They report significant sleep disturbances characterized by decreased sleep duration yet maintained high energy levels, alongside difficulty achieving restful sleep. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including pervasive feelings of being on edge, frequent panic episodes with intense fear of losing control or dying, and avoidance behaviors centered around panic-provoking situations such as crowded environments. The patient exhibits somatic complaints, including unexplained headaches and stomachaches, likely related to ongoing psychological distress.\n\nAdditional clinical features include recurrent ruminative thoughts, compulsive checking behaviors, and dissociative symptoms like feeling detached from oneself and surroundings, especially during panic episodes. The patient demonstrates social withdrawal, citing decreased engagement with friends and family, which may be secondary to anxiety and embarrassment related to panic attacks. There are also indications of passive suicidal ideation, with thoughts of ending life when overwhelmed.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, with notable panic attacks and avoidance, alongside depressive features. No evidence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions was reported. The patient denies substance misuse, including alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder with panic features, and dissociative experiences. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants urgent safety assessment. Risk factors include the intensity of panic episodes, social withdrawal, and passive death wishes, all of which necessitate careful evaluation and intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared significant distress related to persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a marked loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. You are experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> characterized by less sleep but high energy, which can be exhausting and confusing. Your anxiety symptoms are prominent, including a continuous sense of being <sym>on edge</sym>, frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> with intense fear, and avoidance of situations that might trigger these episodes. You also report physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, which seem to be linked to your overall distress. Additionally, you\u2019ve mentioned <sym>rumination</sym> about your worries, <sym>checking behaviors</sym>, and episodes of feeling <sym>dissociated</sym> during panic attacks. You have experienced <quote>dark thoughts</quote> about hurting yourself, indicating serious emotional pain and risk. Your social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection further reflect the impact of your current struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Moderate</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms (Depersonalization/Derealization)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, anhedonia, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep pattern\u2014less sleep with sustained high energy\u2014along with irritability and rumination support this diagnosis. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicates comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> with panic features. The reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> during panic attacks suggest episodes of <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant urgent attention but do not currently indicate active intent, though safety measures are necessary. No evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse was found, and physical symptoms seem secondary to psychological distress rather than a primary medical condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment, including risk of self-harm, and establish safety plans if indicated.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting both depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs or SNRIs), after thorough evaluation and discussion of benefits and side effects.  \n4. Refer to a psychiatrist or primary care provider for further evaluation of sleep disturbances and somatic complaints, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions.  \n5. Encourage regular routines, social engagement, and stress management techniques to support recovery.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety concerns.",
