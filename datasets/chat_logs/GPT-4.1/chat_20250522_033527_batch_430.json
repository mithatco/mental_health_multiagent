This questionnaire helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a helpful tool to identify any symptoms that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various aspects like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question, and you can respond honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You mentioned having occasional <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> but no active plans or intent to harm yourself. Physical complaints include <sym>aches</sym> in your back and joints, which you believe are stress-related.

Conduct a thorough clinical interview to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and assess for any risk factors such as suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviors.\n2.

Monitor for any escalation of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> or emergence of <sym>active suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical evaluation.\n5. Explore options for managing somatic complaints and dissociative symptoms, potentially involving referrals to specialists if needed.\n6.

They describe persistent low mood, diminished interest in activities, and difficulty experiencing pleasure, alongside cognitive concerns such as increased forgetfulness and concentration difficulties. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by early morning awakenings and overall poor sleep quality. The patient also experiences heightened anxiety, characterized by persistent worry, feeling on edge, and avoidance behaviors in response to anxiety-provoking situations. Somatic complaints include unexplained aches and pains, which may be psychosomatic or stress-related.\n\nNotably, the patient reports episodes of derealization or depersonalization\u2014feeling detached from oneself and surroundings\u2014and a sense of identity confusion, suggesting dissociative features. They acknowledge passive suicidal ideation, specifically thoughts about death without intent or plans, which warrants ongoing risk assessment. The absence of auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, or compulsive behaviors is noted. Substance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol misuse or tobacco use.\n\nPatterns reveal a co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, with emotional withdrawal and social distancing. The patient's affective symptoms, combined with cognitive and somatic concerns, suggest a complex presentation that may involve mood disorder with anxious and dissociative features.\n\nPotential clinical significance includes risk for depression-related functional impairment, passive suicidal ideation, and possible comorbid anxiety disorder. The dissociative symptoms merit further exploration to determine their clinical relevance and underlying etiology.\n\nOverall, the assessment indicates a need for comprehensive diagnostic clarification, ongoing safety evaluation, and tailored intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which have made it difficult to enjoy activities or see a way forward. You've also described significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, waking very early and feeling tired during the day, along with increased <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and concentration problems. Anxiety has been a substantial part of your experience, characterized by constant <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoiding situations that heighten your anxiety. Additionally, you've reported episodes of <sym>derealization</sym> or <sym>depersonalization</sym>, feeling detached from yourself and your surroundings, as well as a sense of <sym>identity confusion</sym>. You mentioned having occasional <sym>passive thoughts of death</sym> but no active plans or intent to harm yourself. Physical complaints include <sym>aches</sym> in your back and joints, which you believe are stress-related. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex picture involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, somatic, and dissociative features, which are impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), with anxious and dissociative features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation of <sym>persistent low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and cognitive difficulties such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>concentration problems</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, and avoidance behaviors, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>derealization</sym> and <sym>detachment</sym> indicate dissociative symptoms, which can occur in mood and anxiety conditions, especially when distress is high. The passive <sym>thoughts of death</sym> warrant careful monitoring but currently lack active suicidal intent or plans. The somatic complaints and sleep disruption further support the impact of the mood and anxiety symptoms. This constellation of symptoms aligns most closely with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with additional features of anxiety and dissociation, but a comprehensive clinical assessment is necessary to confirm this and rule out other possible diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview to clarify the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and assess for any risk factors such as suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviors.\n2. Discuss and consider initiation of evidence-based <med>treatment for depression and anxiety</med>, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) and/or pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants).\n3. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> or emergence of <sym>active suicidal ideation</sym>, and develop a safety plan if necessary.\n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medical evaluation.\n5. Explore options for managing somatic complaints and dissociative symptoms, potentially involving referrals to specialists if needed.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, and encourage support from loved ones.\n7. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
