Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything we discuss is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. I will ask you a series of 23 questions, and I'd like you to respond honestly and openly about your experiences over the past two weeks. Are you ready for me to begin with the first question?"

The compulsive behaviors like <sym>hand washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym> seem to be a way you try to manage your troubling thoughts about contamination, harm, or making mistakes, but they also appear to interfere with your daily life and relationships. Your experiences with sleep problems, physical discomfort, and difficulty trusting your emotions further highlight the complexity of what you\u2019re going through. I want to assure you that these symptoms are understandable, and help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (moderate severity).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to contamination, harm, and mistakes, along with compulsive behaviors such as <sym>hand washing, checking, and silent repetitions</sym>, strongly suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Symptoms of <sym>feeling on edge, panic episodes, avoidance of certain situations, and dissociative feelings</sym> indicate significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The pervasive <sym>feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and fatigue</sym> point toward <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptom patterns suggests a complex presentation involving multiple overlapping conditions, which is common in clinical practice. The absence of psychotic features or substance misuse supports this working diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Consider a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focusing on exposure and response prevention for OCD, along with interventions targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other appropriate medications to help manage obsessive thoughts, compulsions, and mood symptoms.  \n4. Develop a supportive, structured routine to improve sleep hygiene and reduce stress.  \n5. Explore additional support options such as group therapy or support groups for OCD and depression, if suitable.",

Concurrently, the patient reports significant anxiety symptoms, notably heightened nervousness, worry, and panic episodes (Q7, Q8), as well as avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations (Q9). \n\nAdditionally, there is evidence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, such as persistent intrusive thoughts related to contamination, harm, and mistakes (Q17), alongside compulsive rituals like hand washing, checking, and silent repetitions (Q18). The patient also reports dissociative experiences, including feelings of detachment and depersonalization (Q19), and confusion about personal identity and emotional regulation (Q20). Social functioning appears compromised, with reports of strained relationships due to time-consuming compulsions (Q21).\n\nNo indications of psychotic symptoms are evident, as the patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations (Q13) and thought broadcasting (Q14). Substance use appears minimal, with no current alcohol or tobacco use (Q22, Q23), and no recent misuse of prescribed medications (Q24).\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and comorbid anxiety disorder. The patient's reports of panic attacks, avoidance, and dissociation warrant careful assessment for panic disorder and dissociative phenomena. The presence of self-reported intrusive thoughts and compulsions suggests a diagnosis of OCD.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include feelings of hopelessness, impaired functioning, and social withdrawal, which could elevate risk for worsening mood or suicidality, although no current suicidal ideation was reported.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and anxiety symptoms with associated dissociative features, warranting comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very detailed picture of your current experience, and I want to acknowledge how challenging it must be to cope with these persistent worries, intrusive thoughts, and rituals. It\u2019s clear that you are struggling with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressed mood</sym>, along with significant anxiety, including episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and a sense of being <sym>distant or detached</sym> from yourself. The compulsive behaviors like <sym>hand washing</sym> and <sym>checking</sym> seem to be a way you try to manage your troubling thoughts about contamination, harm, or making mistakes, but they also appear to interfere with your daily life and relationships. Your experiences with sleep problems, physical discomfort, and difficulty trusting your emotions further highlight the complexity of what you\u2019re going through. I want to assure you that these symptoms are understandable, and help is available to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (moderate severity).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report of persistent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> related to contamination, harm, and mistakes, along with compulsive behaviors such as <sym>hand washing, checking, and silent repetitions</sym>, strongly suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. Symptoms of <sym>feeling on edge, panic episodes, avoidance of certain situations, and dissociative feelings</sym> indicate significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The pervasive <sym>feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and fatigue</sym> point toward <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptom patterns suggests a complex presentation involving multiple overlapping conditions, which is common in clinical practice. The absence of psychotic features or substance misuse supports this working diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess severity.  \n2. Consider a combination of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> focusing on exposure and response prevention for OCD, along with interventions targeting depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the potential benefit of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other appropriate medications to help manage obsessive thoughts, compulsions, and mood symptoms.  \n4. Develop a supportive, structured routine to improve sleep hygiene and reduce stress.  \n5. Explore additional support options such as group therapy or support groups for OCD and depression, if suitable.",
