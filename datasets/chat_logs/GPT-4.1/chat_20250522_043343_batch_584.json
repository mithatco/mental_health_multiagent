I'm going to administer a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health across different domains. The goal is to get a broad picture of how you're feeling and functioning, which can guide any further support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, trauma, and more. I'll ask you each question, and I'd like you to respond based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that you are going through a very difficult time following a traumatic event, specifically an accident, which continues to affect many aspects of your life. You experience persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, losing interest in activities you once enjoyed and feeling disconnected from yourself and others. Your anxiety is intense and pervasive, characterized by <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, and avoidance of situations like driving, which triggers distress. Sleep has been severely disrupted, with frequent awakenings, nightmares, and exhaustion, and you experience physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension. You also report intrusive memories and flashbacks, along with feelings of dissociation and numbness, which seem to reinforce your sense of being overwhelmed and lost. Despite these challenges, you have some thoughts of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, though without any active plan. Your increased use of alcohol and cigarettes appears to be an attempt to cope with the emotional pain, but this may pose additional risks. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex interplay of trauma-related distress, mood disturbance, and substance use, all of which significantly impair your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, notably the presence of <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as avoiding driving and public transportation, and dissociative symptoms like feeling disconnected from oneself. The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicate a major depressive episode. The increased use of alcohol and cigarettes suggests maladaptive coping strategies, which could complicate the clinical picture. The trauma-related symptoms, alongside mood disturbance and substance use, point to a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> with comorbid depression and substance use disorder. The symptoms are severe enough to warrant intervention, but further assessment is needed to confirm the extent and impact of each condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for pharmacotherapy, potentially including antidepressants or anxiolytics.  \n3. Develop a safety plan to address passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor risk.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about trauma, depression, and substance use, emphasizing healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Refer to a substance use specialist for assessment and support regarding alcohol and tobacco use.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medication.  \n7. Offer ongoing emotional support and consider involving support networks or group therapy for shared experiences.",

There is a significant presence of anxiety symptoms, including pervasive worry, hyperarousal, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, notably avoiding driving and public transportation. Intrusive memories, flashbacks, and hypervigilance suggest comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to a recent traumatic event, notably a motor vehicle accident. The patient reports sleep disturbances marked by fragmentation, nightmares, and fatigue, alongside somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension. Cognitive concerns include concentration difficulties and disorientation. There are indications of emotional numbing and dissociation, as well as feelings of depersonalization and derealization. The patient demonstrates maladaptive coping strategies, including increased alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, which may elevate risk factors for further psychological or physical health complications. Passive SI thoughts are reported but without active intent or plan. No psychotic symptoms or hallucinations are evident.\n\n**Patterns & Clinical Significance:**\n- Mood symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness)\n- Anxiety and hyperarousal (panic, hypervigilance, avoidance)\n- Trauma-related symptoms (intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, dissociation)\n- Sleep disturbances and somatic complaints\n- Substance use as maladaptive coping\n\n**Risk Factors & Warning Signs:**\n- Passive SI thoughts, with no current safety plan indicated\n- Increased alcohol intake and cigarette use\n- Significant avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal\n- Chronic sleep disturbances and hyperarousal symptoms, which may exacerbate mood and cognitive impairments\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation of major depressive symptoms intertwined with features of PTSD, including hypervigilance, intrusive memories, and dissociation, compounded by substance use and sleep disruption. The clinical picture indicates a need for comprehensive assessment, potential trauma-informed intervention, and safety evaluation regarding suicidal ideation.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are going through a very difficult time following a traumatic event, specifically an accident, which continues to affect many aspects of your life. You experience persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, losing interest in activities you once enjoyed and feeling disconnected from yourself and others. Your anxiety is intense and pervasive, characterized by <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, and avoidance of situations like driving, which triggers distress. Sleep has been severely disrupted, with frequent awakenings, nightmares, and exhaustion, and you experience physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension. You also report intrusive memories and flashbacks, along with feelings of dissociation and numbness, which seem to reinforce your sense of being overwhelmed and lost. Despite these challenges, you have some thoughts of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>, though without any active plan. Your increased use of alcohol and cigarettes appears to be an attempt to cope with the emotional pain, but this may pose additional risks. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex interplay of trauma-related distress, mood disturbance, and substance use, all of which significantly impair your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with DSM-5 criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, notably the presence of <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>hypervigilance</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> such as avoiding driving and public transportation, and dissociative symptoms like feeling disconnected from oneself. The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> indicate a major depressive episode. The increased use of alcohol and cigarettes suggests maladaptive coping strategies, which could complicate the clinical picture. The trauma-related symptoms, alongside mood disturbance and substance use, point to a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> with comorbid depression and substance use disorder. The symptoms are severe enough to warrant intervention, but further assessment is needed to confirm the extent and impact of each condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or prolonged exposure (PE), to address PTSD symptoms.  \n2. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to determine the need for pharmacotherapy, potentially including antidepressants or anxiolytics.  \n3. Develop a safety plan to address passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor risk.  \n4. Provide psychoeducation about trauma, depression, and substance use, emphasizing healthy coping strategies.  \n5. Refer to a substance use specialist for assessment and support regarding alcohol and tobacco use.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medication.  \n7. Offer ongoing emotional support and consider involving support networks or group therapy for shared experiences.",
