We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to assess various areas of mental health over the past two weeks. This helps us identify any symptoms that might be affecting you and guides us in planning the best support. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions covering different aspects of your mental health, and I'll be asking each one in turn. Are you ready to begin?"

The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of self</sym>, point toward dissociative experiences that may be related to trauma or stress-related disorders. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, compulsive behaviors, and difficulty with memory are indicative of obsessive-compulsive features.

The presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful assessment and intervention, but given the overall pattern, the primary diagnosis appears to be a mood disorder with multiple comorbid features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and substance use.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-informed therapies to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist for <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medications</med>, tailored to symptom severity and response.  \n4. Develop a plan for substance use treatment, which may include counseling or referral to a specialized program.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the interconnectedness of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use, emphasizing coping skills and relapse prevention.  \n6. Arrange for regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment adherence.",

The patient reports persistent anxiety (Q7), occasional panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors related to social and crowded environments. Sleep disturbance is prominent, characterized by reduced duration and fragmentation (Q5, Q15), accompanied by fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as memory impairment (Q16). Intrusive, recurrent thoughts and compulsive behaviors (Q17, Q18) suggest possible obsessive-compulsive features.\n\nThe patient also exhibits somatic complaints, including frequent headaches and muscle aches (Q10), and reports dissociative experiences (Q19), as well as a loss of sense of self and existential disconnection (Q20). Substance use is notable, with regular cigarette smoking (Q23), alcohol consumption exceeding typical limits (Q22), and self-directed use of prescription medications and recreational drugs (Q24), which may serve as maladaptive coping strategies.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive disturbances, dissociative experiences, and substance use, all of which are clinically significant and may compound overall functioning. The presence of passive suicidal ideation (Q12) warrants careful risk assessment.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include reported fleeting SI thoughts, substance misuse, social withdrawal, dissociative symptoms, and sleep disturbances\u2014all of which may elevate the risk for worsening mental health or self-harm.\n\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates complex psychopathology characterized by depressive, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, dissociative, and substance use features. These findings suggest the need for a comprehensive evaluation to determine diagnostic clarity and to inform a multidisciplinary treatment approach addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use concerns, with ongoing risk assessment for suicidality.",

      "expected": "substance_abuse",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of emotional, cognitive, and physical challenges that have been affecting your life deeply. You experience persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, alongside increased <sym>irritability</sym> and social withdrawal. Your sleep disturbances, including <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and fragmented rest, contribute to feelings of exhaustion and cognitive difficulties like <sym>forgetfulness</sym>. Anxiety is a significant factor, with ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, occasional <sym>panic</sym> episodes, and avoidance behaviors. You also describe intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym>, compulsive routines, dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym>, and a sense of <sym>lost identity</sym>. Substance use, including alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication, appears to be a way you've been coping with these distressing feelings and thoughts. You\u2019ve also mentioned some fleeting thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which is important to take very seriously. Your experiences reflect a multifaceted struggle involving mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use issues, all of which significantly impact your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety, Dissociative, and Substance Use features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and impaired sleep, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The dissociative symptoms, such as <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>loss of self</sym>, point toward dissociative experiences that may be related to trauma or stress-related disorders. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, compulsive behaviors, and difficulty with memory are indicative of obsessive-compulsive features. Substance use\u2014particularly alcohol, tobacco, and self-medication\u2014may be serving as maladaptive coping strategies and could complicate the clinical picture, potentially leading to <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The presence of passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful assessment and intervention, but given the overall pattern, the primary diagnosis appears to be a mood disorder with multiple comorbid features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and substance use.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-informed therapies to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist for <med>antidepressants</med> and/or <med>anti-anxiety medications</med>, tailored to symptom severity and response.  \n4. Develop a plan for substance use treatment, which may include counseling or referral to a specialized program.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about the interconnectedness of mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use, emphasizing coping skills and relapse prevention.  \n6. Arrange for regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment adherence.",
