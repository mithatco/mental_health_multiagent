Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us get a broad picture of different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's completely confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you to share your experiences. I'll ask you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, and you can tell me about how you've been feeling and functioning recently. Are you ready to begin?"

Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggest a deep sense of sadness and disconnection from activities you once enjoyed. The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> contribute to a heightened state of distress, leading you to avoid situations that might trigger these episodes. Your sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and waking up feeling tired, combined with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, indicate a high level of emotional and physiological arousal. Additionally, your social withdrawal and feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> reflect a profound sense of disconnection from yourself and others. The use of substances like alcohol and tobacco appears to be an attempt to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Overall, your symptoms point to significant mental health challenges that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms, including Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's presentation includes persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder, particularly Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues (forgetfulness, disorientation), and somatic complaints (headaches, muscle tension) further support this. The dissociative symptoms and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> may indicate comorbid dissociative experiences or trauma-related features, but the primary clinical picture aligns with mood and anxiety disorders. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive checking behaviors could also suggest obsessive-compulsive features, but these are less prominent. Overall, the symptom profile points toward a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider the need for medication such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents.  \n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, panic management, and emotional regulation.  \n3. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms or past trauma are identified as contributing factors.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical consultation to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Develop coping strategies to reduce reliance on substances and improve emotional resilience.  \n6. Monitor for any signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place.",

Core concerns include pervasive low mood characterized by anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation without active intent. The patient reports heightened irritability, increased anxiety, and panic episodes with associated physiological symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, sweating), alongside avoidance behaviors related to panic and social situations. Sleep disturbance is prominent, with difficulty falling and maintaining sleep, resulting in fatigue and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and disorientation during periods of heightened anxiety. Intrusive thoughts about losing control or dying are recurrent, accompanied by compulsive checking behaviors and dissociative experiences. There are also reports of emotional numbing, social withdrawal, and a sense of identity confusion or existential questioning.\n\nPattern analysis suggests a mood disorder with features of depression and anxiety, particularly panic disorder, given the presence of panic attacks, agoraphobic avoidance, and generalized anxiety symptoms. Somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and tension, further support this clinical picture. Substance use (alcohol and nicotine) appears to be used as maladaptive coping mechanisms, especially during periods of heightened distress.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include risk factors for self-harm or suicidal ideation, given passive thoughts of self-harm and overwhelming emotional states. The dissociative experiences and cognitive disturbances warrant careful assessment for comorbid dissociative or trauma-related conditions. The patient's feelings of disconnection from self and others, along with social withdrawal, are noteworthy for their impact on functioning and relational health.\n\nOverall, the patient exhibits multiple interrelated symptoms across mood, anxiety, somatic, cognitive, and behavioral domains, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic formulation and tailored intervention plan.",

      "predicted": "You are experiencing a complex set of emotional, physical, and cognitive symptoms that have significantly impacted your daily life. Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggest a deep sense of sadness and disconnection from activities you once enjoyed. The frequent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and persistent <sym>anxiety</sym> contribute to a heightened state of distress, leading you to avoid situations that might trigger these episodes. Your sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and waking up feeling tired, combined with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, indicate a high level of emotional and physiological arousal. Additionally, your social withdrawal and feelings of <sym>identity confusion</sym> reflect a profound sense of disconnection from yourself and others. The use of substances like alcohol and tobacco appears to be an attempt to cope with these overwhelming feelings. Overall, your symptoms point to significant mental health challenges that require careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \n<med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms, including Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety</med>\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe patient's presentation includes persistent low mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder, particularly Panic Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, cognitive issues (forgetfulness, disorientation), and somatic complaints (headaches, muscle tension) further support this. The dissociative symptoms and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> may indicate comorbid dissociative experiences or trauma-related features, but the primary clinical picture aligns with mood and anxiety disorders. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsive checking behaviors could also suggest obsessive-compulsive features, but these are less prominent. Overall, the symptom profile points toward a complex mood and anxiety disorder spectrum.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Seek a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and consider the need for medication such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety agents.  \n2. Engage in psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address maladaptive thought patterns, panic management, and emotional regulation.  \n3. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms or past trauma are identified as contributing factors.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medical consultation to improve sleep quality.  \n5. Develop coping strategies to reduce reliance on substances and improve emotional resilience.  \n6. Monitor for any signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning is in place.",
