You've also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>worried</sym> most of the time, along with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain, which seem to be distressing for you. The sense of <sym>detachment</sym> and feeling <sym>lost</sym> about your identity and relationships adds another layer of difficulty. You\u2019ve also expressed <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is important for us to monitor carefully. Overall, it seems like you are experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress across multiple domains, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as excessive worry, avoidance, and physical sensations, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, which are common in depressive episodes. The reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> (feeling detached from oneself or surroundings) and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym> point toward <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>, which may be secondary to or intertwined with mood and anxiety symptoms. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> further underscore the severity of depression, though there are no current plans or intent. The somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and pains, could be related to somatic manifestations of depression or somatic symptom presentation, but they are not sufficient alone to diagnose <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Overall, the constellation of affective, cognitive, somatic, and dissociative symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with notable anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and develop an individualized treatment plan.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, in conjunction with psychotherapy, particularly evidence-based approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.\n3. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety planning is in place.\n4. Address sleep disturbances and somatic complaints through medical evaluation and supportive interventions.\n5. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms suggest underlying trauma or stress-related factors.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, and connect with support networks or community resources as appropriate.",

Behavioral indicators such as social withdrawal (A21) and anhedonia suggest notable affective and interpersonal impairments. The patient reports heightened anxiety characterized by excessive worry (A7), avoidance behaviors (A9), and somatic preoccupations (A10), consistent with co-occurring anxiety features.\n\nCognitive and neurovegetative symptoms are evident through reported sleep disturbances (A15), memory impairment (A16), and fatigue despite increased sleep duration (A5). The presence of dissociative experiences (A19) and feelings of depersonalization or detachment further suggest dissociative symptomatology. The patient endorses passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plan (A12), representing a potential risk factor requiring ongoing assessment.\n\nAdditionally, somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and pains (A10), and feelings of being dismissed regarding physical health concerns (A11), are notable. The patient denies psychotic symptoms (A13, A14), compulsive behaviors (A18), substance misuse (A22, A23), or non-prescribed medication use (A24).\n\nPatterns of symptomatology reflect a mood disorder with concomitant anxiety features, cognitive disturbances, and dissociative experiences. The suicidal thoughts, though passive, warrant vigilant monitoring given the patient's affective state. The dissociative and somatic symptoms may suggest underlying psychosomatic or trauma-related processes, meriting further assessment.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive symptoms with anxious and dissociative features, alongside somatic complaints and passive suicidal ideation, highlighting the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and tailored intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your current mental health, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it can be to experience these feelings and symptoms. It sounds like you are struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, including <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. You've also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>worried</sym> most of the time, along with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and back pain, which seem to be distressing for you. The sense of <sym>detachment</sym> and feeling <sym>lost</sym> about your identity and relationships adds another layer of difficulty. You\u2019ve also expressed <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is important for us to monitor carefully. Overall, it seems like you are experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress across multiple domains, and I appreciate your honesty in sharing these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate severity</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting over two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as excessive worry, avoidance, and physical sensations, suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, which are common in depressive episodes. The reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> (feeling detached from oneself or surroundings) and <sym>uncertainty about identity</sym> point toward <med>Dissociative symptoms</med>, which may be secondary to or intertwined with mood and anxiety symptoms. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> further underscore the severity of depression, though there are no current plans or intent. The somatic complaints, including unexplained aches and pains, could be related to somatic manifestations of depression or somatic symptom presentation, but they are not sufficient alone to diagnose <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. Overall, the constellation of affective, cognitive, somatic, and dissociative symptoms aligns with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, with notable anxiety and dissociative features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk, and develop an individualized treatment plan.\n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, in conjunction with psychotherapy, particularly evidence-based approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy.\n3. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety planning is in place.\n4. Address sleep disturbances and somatic complaints through medical evaluation and supportive interventions.\n5. Explore trauma-informed therapy if dissociative symptoms suggest underlying trauma or stress-related factors.\n6. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, and connect with support networks or community resources as appropriate.",
