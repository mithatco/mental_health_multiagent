Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to talk openly. I will ask you a series of 23 questions about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors over the past two weeks. There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just answer honestly based on your experiences.

You also describe feeling <sym>anxious and on edge</sym>, with worries that are hard to control, and sometimes <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> in social settings.

There are no indications of psychosis or substance misuse, which helps refine this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and to rule out other possible diagnoses.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for any escalation in risk.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other psychotherapy modalities suited for depression and anxiety. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist if symptoms are severe or persistent.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical evaluation.  \n5. Explore possible underlying factors, including stressors or trauma, that may be contributing to the symptoms, and incorporate trauma-informed care if needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing that help is available and recovery is possible.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient reports pervasive symptoms indicative of significant depressive and anxiety features, including persistent anhedonia, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed. There is a notable presence of mood disturbance characterized by sadness, hopelessness, and emotional withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, hypervigilance, avoidance behaviors, and episodic panic-like sensations, particularly in social settings. Somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches are likely stress-related. Cognitive concerns include forgetfulness and disconnection from self and surroundings, suggestive of derealization or dissociative experiences. The patient also endorses passive suicidal ideation without active intent, which warrants close monitoring. No psychotic symptoms or substance misuse are reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The concurrent presentation of depressive (anhedonia, hopelessness, social withdrawal) and anxiety symptoms (worry, avoidance, panic) suggests comorbid mood and anxiety disorder features.\n- Sleep disturbance (difficulty maintaining sleep) and cognitive impairment (memory issues, feelings of detachment) further complicate the clinical picture.\n- The patient's insight into their emotional state is evident, but feelings of being misunderstood and feelings of being lost may impact engagement with treatment.\n\n**Risk Factors / Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, especially in the context of hopelessness and emotional distress, represent a significant clinical concern requiring safety assessment.\n- Feelings of dissociation and detachment may impair functioning and indicate potential dissociative features or trauma-related concerns.\n- Chronic stress and somatic symptoms may exacerbate mental health difficulties.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with a complex profile marked by major depressive symptoms, pervasive anxiety, somatic complaints, cognitive disturbances, and passive suicidal ideation. The pattern suggests a severe mood and anxiety disorder spectrum, necessitating a comprehensive clinical evaluation and safety planning. Further assessment should explore underlying trauma, duration of symptoms, functional impairment, and protective factors to inform treatment planning.",

        "dsm_coverage": "The conversation covers many key DSM-5 Level 1 domains, including depression, anxiety, anger, sleep, somatic symptoms, dissociation, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, memory, and substance use. However, it only superficially addresses some domains, notably personality functioning and repetitive thoughts/behaviors, which are only touched on briefly or with less depth. The therapist does not explicitly explore mania or detailed aspects of personality pathology, and there is limited probing beyond initial questions. Overall, the coverage is adequate but leaves significant areas only partially explored.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions asked largely align with DSM-5 criteria, and the phrasing is appropriate for clinical assessment. The therapist accurately reflects symptom terminology, such as 'little interest or pleasure,' 'feeling down,' 'feeling on edge,' and 'passive thoughts of self-harm.' Minor improvements could include more precise follow-up prompts to clarify severity or duration, but overall the questions are relevant and clinically sound. Slightly more nuanced phrasing or prompting could enhance specificity.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue maintains a logical flow, with questions building on previous responses and following a coherent sequence. The therapist transitions smoothly from mood to anxiety, somatic, and other domains, and responses are addressed appropriately. Some minor inconsistencies occur, such as a brief mention of risky behaviors that the patient denies without further probing; however, these do not significantly disrupt the conversation. Overall, the conversation is quite consistent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with features of Anxiety Disorder is supported by the patient's reports of depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, which align with DSM-5 criteria. The clinician's reasoning is generally sound, citing specific symptoms like social withdrawal, sleep disturbance, and passive suicidal thoughts. However, the justification lacks detailed linkage to specific DSM-5 criteria, such as duration, impairment, or exclusion of other disorders like bipolar disorder or trauma-related conditions. Additionally, the reasoning does not thoroughly explore alternative diagnoses or differential considerations, limiting its depth.",
        "empathy": "The therapist maintains a professional and generally empathetic tone, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. The responses are warm and non-judgmental, which fosters rapport. However, there is limited explicit use of empathetic statements that directly acknowledge the emotional pain or provide reassurance beyond procedural questions. Minor improvements in personalizing responses or explicitly affirming the patient's courage in sharing could elevate this score. Nonetheless, the tone remains appropriate and respectful throughout."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrates a solid foundation in DSM-5 symptom assessment, covering most relevant domains with appropriate clinical relevance and a logical flow. The primary areas for improvement include more comprehensive exploration of all DSM-5 dimensions\u2014particularly personality functioning and repetitive thoughts\u2014and a more explicit and nuanced diagnostic justification. The therapist's tone is generally empathetic and professional, though opportunities exist to deepen the emotional validation. Overall, this is a competent assessment conversation with room for refinement to achieve a higher level of thoroughness and diagnostic clarity.",

The symptoms described align more closely with a primary mood and anxiety disorder, including persistent depression, anhedonia, hopelessness, anxiety, panic symptoms, and somatic complaints. Adjustment disorder typically involves a maladaptive response to a specific stressor with less severe or persistent symptoms, which is not explicitly indicated here. Therefore, the diagnosis does not match the expected profile of adjustment disorder.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a wide range of difficult feelings and thoughts over the past two weeks. You mention feeling <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> and often <sym>hopeless</sym> about your situation, which suggests a deep sense of sadness and loss of motivation. You also describe feeling <sym>anxious and on edge</sym>, with worries that are hard to control, and sometimes <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> in social settings. Physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and stomachaches</sym>, along with difficulties with <sym>sleep, concentration, and feelings of detachment</sym>, add to your distress. You\u2019ve also disclosed <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> and feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected from yourself and others. These symptoms indicate significant emotional suffering that impacts your daily functioning and sense of well-being, and I want to acknowledge how hard this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with features of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (specifically generalized anxiety and panic symptoms)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry, feeling on edge, avoidance behaviors, and episodic panic sensations</sym> aligns with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, somatic complaints, and feelings of dissociation</sym> support a severe mood and anxiety presentation. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>feelings of being misunderstood or lost</sym> highlight the severity and need for close monitoring. There are no indications of psychosis or substance misuse, which helps refine this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to assess the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, and to rule out other possible diagnoses.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for any escalation in risk.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other psychotherapy modalities suited for depression and anxiety. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist if symptoms are severe or persistent.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical evaluation.  \n5. Explore possible underlying factors, including stressors or trauma, that may be contributing to the symptoms, and incorporate trauma-informed care if needed.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about depression and anxiety, emphasizing that help is available and recovery is possible.",
