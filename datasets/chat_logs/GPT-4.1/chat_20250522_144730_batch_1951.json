Additionally, symptoms such as persistent <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features.

The patient's <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco\u2014may serve as maladaptive coping strategies, which could exacerbate or maintain their emotional difficulties. The overall clinical picture points toward a complex mood and anxiety presentation with substance involvement, elevating the risk for self-harm and functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and evaluate for risk of <med>self-harm</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-injury urges</sym>.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and maladaptive coping skills.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, after a thorough psychiatric assessment.  \n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized substance use treatment programs.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about the interconnectedness of mood, anxiety, and substance use, and encourage regular follow-up to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Assessment Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with a constellation of symptoms indicative of significant mood disturbance, anxiety, and possible substance use issues. Key features include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. There are reports of irritability, increased irritability, and argumentativeness, which may reflect mood dysregulation or irritability associated with mood or other affective disorders. Sleep disturbance is noted, characterized by reduced sleep duration coupled with restlessness and fatigue, which may exacerbate emotional dysregulation.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by persistent worry, feeling on edge, and episodic panic-like sensations, alongside avoidance behaviors targeting social situations. Somatic complaints include unexplained headaches and muscle tension, which could be somatic manifestations of anxiety or stress. Intrusive thoughts and compulsive-like mental routines suggest features consistent with obsessive-compulsive phenomena.\n\nThe patient reports derealization or depersonalization experiences, alongside identity confusion and feelings of disconnection\u2014symptoms that warrant further evaluation for dissociative phenomena or other psychotic features, though no auditory or visual hallucinations are reported. There is a history of self-harm ideation, with thoughts of escape, indicating elevated suicide risk. Substance use is notable, with recent alcohol bingeing, increased cigarette smoking, and non-prescribed medication and drug use, which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms and pose additional health risks.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a pattern of emotional dysregulation, sleep disruption, substance use, and dissociative experiences, which may be interconnected. The patient's presentation suggests a complex clinical picture involving mood disorder features, anxiety, substance use, and dissociative symptoms, with potential risk for self-harm.\n\nClinical Significance and Risk Factors:\n- Elevated risk for suicidal ideation due to persistent hopelessness and self-harm thoughts.\n- Presence of substance use that may impair judgment and exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n- Symptoms of dissociation and identity disturbance warrant careful assessment for underlying trauma or dissociative disorders.\n- Sleep disturbances and somatic complaints may contribute to overall functional impairment.\n- Anxiety symptoms with avoidance behaviors could lead to social withdrawal and further isolation.\n\nOverall, these findings highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic formulation, safety assessment, and development of an integrated treatment plan addressing mood, anxiety, substance use, and dissociative symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very challenging experience, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to feel <sym>hopeless</sym>, <sym>dissociated</sym>, and overwhelmed by persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>mood disturbances</sym>. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>. It\u2019s also concerning that you\u2019ve experienced <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and have been using substances, such as alcohol, marijuana, and increased smoking, possibly as ways to cope with these intense feelings. Your experiences of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>identity confusion</sym> suggest a complex emotional state that requires careful attention. I appreciate your honesty in sharing these symptoms, and I want to assure you that help is available, and you don\u2019t have to face this alone.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Substance Use</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as persistent <sym>worry</sym>, feeling <sym>on edge</sym>, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest significant <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>compulsive-like behaviors</sym>, and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> may indicate overlapping features of obsessive-compulsive and dissociative phenomena, but these appear secondary to the mood and anxiety symptoms. The patient's <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco\u2014may serve as maladaptive coping strategies, which could exacerbate or maintain their emotional difficulties. The overall clinical picture points toward a complex mood and anxiety presentation with substance involvement, elevating the risk for self-harm and functional impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of symptoms, and evaluate for risk of <med>self-harm</med>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-injury urges</sym>.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and maladaptive coping skills.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant, after a thorough psychiatric assessment.  \n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing or referral to specialized substance use treatment programs.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about the interconnectedness of mood, anxiety, and substance use, and encourage regular follow-up to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
