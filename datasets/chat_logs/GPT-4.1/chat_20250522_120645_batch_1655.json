Today, I will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to identify any areas that might need further attention and to help guide potential next steps in your care. Please know that everything you share is confidential and this is a safe space for you to be open. We will go through a total of 23 questions, one at a time. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>worried</sym> most of the time, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that can be overwhelming. Sleep problems, including trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, are affecting your energy levels and concentration. You\u2019ve also reported cognitive concerns like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself or your environment. Additionally, you\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, and your use of substances such as cigarettes and prescription medications suggests attempts to cope with these feelings. Your experiences of social withdrawal and feeling lost about your identity highlight the complexity of what you\u2019re going through, and your honesty is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely generalized anxiety and panic symptoms), with some dissociative features and risky substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors support a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive symptoms such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> suggest dissociative experiences, which can occur with severe distress. The self-reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and substance use indicate areas of concern for safety and maladaptive coping strategies. While some symptoms are severe, the overall presentation does not meet criteria for other specific mental disorders such as <med>Schizophrenia</med> or <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med>, but further assessment may be needed to clarify dissociative features and substance use impact.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, including safety planning regarding self-harm thoughts.  \n2. Develop a tailored treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) focused on depression, anxiety, and coping skills.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, as appropriate and under medical supervision.  \n4. Address substance use by providing education and resources for reducing or stopping cigarette smoking and prescription medication misuse.  \n5. Explore support options, including social connections and community resources, to reduce social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.",

Concurrently, the patient reports heightened anxiety, including persistent worry, panic episodes, social avoidance, and physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle pains, indicating comorbid anxiety features. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, leading to daytime fatigue. Cognitive concerns are evident through reports of memory impairment and feelings of disconnection or depersonalization. Additionally, the patient describes episodes of feeling detached from self and surroundings, which may reflect dissociative phenomena.\n\nBehavioral patterns include increased engagement in new activities, possibly as a coping mechanism, and substance use, notably regular cigarette smoking and self-directed use of prescription medications, which pose potential risk factors. The mention of suicidal ideation, albeit without intent or plan, warrants clinical attention due to the presence of hopelessness and overwhelming distress.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include major depressive disorder with features of psychomotor agitation or irritability, generalized anxiety disorder with panic components, cognitive disturbances, and dissociative experiences. The substance use raises concern for possible maladaptive coping strategies and warrants further assessment. Risk factors include suicidal thoughts, substance misuse, and dissociative symptoms.\n\nOverall, the patient presents with a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, dissociative, and substance-related symptoms, requiring comprehensive evaluation to determine diagnosis and appropriate intervention planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a range of challenging symptoms that reflect significant emotional distress and mental health difficulties. You\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, where things that once brought you joy no longer do. You\u2019ve mentioned feeling <sym>irritable</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>worried</sym> most of the time, along with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that can be overwhelming. Sleep problems, including trouble falling asleep and waking up during the night, are affecting your energy levels and concentration. You\u2019ve also reported cognitive concerns like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself or your environment. Additionally, you\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, and your use of substances such as cigarettes and prescription medications suggests attempts to cope with these feelings. Your experiences of social withdrawal and feeling lost about your identity highlight the complexity of what you\u2019re going through, and your honesty is an important step toward seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (likely generalized anxiety and panic symptoms), with some dissociative features and risky substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors support a concurrent <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Cognitive symptoms such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> suggest dissociative experiences, which can occur with severe distress. The self-reported <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and substance use indicate areas of concern for safety and maladaptive coping strategies. While some symptoms are severe, the overall presentation does not meet criteria for other specific mental disorders such as <med>Schizophrenia</med> or <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med>, but further assessment may be needed to clarify dissociative features and substance use impact.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess risk, including safety planning regarding self-harm thoughts.  \n2. Develop a tailored treatment plan that includes psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) focused on depression, anxiety, and coping skills.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, as appropriate and under medical supervision.  \n4. Address substance use by providing education and resources for reducing or stopping cigarette smoking and prescription medication misuse.  \n5. Explore support options, including social connections and community resources, to reduce social withdrawal and feelings of disconnection.",
