It\u2019s clear that you're experiencing significant emotional distress, including <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and numbness</sym>, <sym>irritability and difficulty controlling anger</sym>, and <sym>anxiety with worry and panic episodes</sym>. These feelings are affecting your sleep, causing both <sym>sleep disturbances and fatigue</sym>, and impacting your relationships and daily functioning. You also mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts, feelings of dissociation, and identity confusion</sym>, which can be very distressing. Your openness about <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is important and indicates the need for careful attention to your safety and well-being. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed given these symptoms, and seeking help is a positive step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Major Depressive Episode (moderate to severe), with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym> align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety, panic-like episodes, sleep disturbances, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder or panic symptoms</med>. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate increased risk and severity of depression. The symptoms of <sym>dissociation and identity confusion</sym> may be related to emotional distress or underlying trauma, but further assessment would be necessary to clarify this. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary, but it warrants monitoring. Overall, the symptom pattern suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder with significant impairment and risk factors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for suicidal ideation and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) tailored to depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist\u2019s consultation to address mood symptoms and anxiety, especially given the severity of depression and passive suicidal thoughts.  \n4. Address sleep problems through behavioral strategies or medical consultation.  \n5. Establish ongoing monitoring of symptoms, substance use, and safety, with adjustments to treatment as needed.",

There is evidence of mood disturbance including feelings of being overwhelmed, irritability (Q4), and persistent anxiety (Q7), with associated somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches (Q10). Sleep disturbances are evident, with reports of both hypersomnia and disrupted sleep quality (Q5, Q15). Cognitive concerns include memory difficulties and intrusive thoughts related to stressors (Q16, Q17). The patient endorses passive suicidal ideation (Q12), indicating notable risk for self-harm. Anxiety symptoms include panic-like episodes (Q8) and avoidance behaviors (Q9), suggestive of possible panic or agoraphobic features.\n\nPatterns suggest a complex presentation with co-occurring mood, anxiety, and somatic symptoms, compounded by feelings of dissociation (Q19) and identity confusion (Q20). Substance use includes episodic alcohol consumption (Q22) and occasional cigarette smoking (Q23), which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient denies psychotic symptoms or compulsive behaviors but reports significant emotional distress and passive death wishes.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance** include major depressive episodes, generalized anxiety, panic symptoms, and substance use as a form of self-medication. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants urgent assessment of safety.\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs** include suicidal thoughts, feelings of hopelessness, social withdrawal, and substance use, all of which necessitate careful safety planning and further assessment.\n\n**Overall,** the patient presents with a multifaceted affective disorder marked by depressive symptoms, anxiety, somatic complaints, dissociative experiences, and passive suicidal ideation, indicating the need for comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very honest and detailed account of how you've been feeling lately. It\u2019s clear that you're experiencing significant emotional distress, including <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness and numbness</sym>, <sym>irritability and difficulty controlling anger</sym>, and <sym>anxiety with worry and panic episodes</sym>. These feelings are affecting your sleep, causing both <sym>sleep disturbances and fatigue</sym>, and impacting your relationships and daily functioning. You also mentioned having <sym>intrusive thoughts, feelings of dissociation, and identity confusion</sym>, which can be very distressing. Your openness about <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is important and indicates the need for careful attention to your safety and well-being. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed given these symptoms, and seeking help is a positive step toward feeling better.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Major Depressive Episode (moderate to severe), with comorbid Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, irritability, and social withdrawal</sym> align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety, panic-like episodes, sleep disturbances, and avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder or panic symptoms</med>. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate increased risk and severity of depression. The symptoms of <sym>dissociation and identity confusion</sym> may be related to emotional distress or underlying trauma, but further assessment would be necessary to clarify this. Substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary, but it warrants monitoring. Overall, the symptom pattern suggests a complex mood and anxiety disorder with significant impairment and risk factors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including risk assessment for suicidal ideation and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) tailored to depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy with a psychiatrist\u2019s consultation to address mood symptoms and anxiety, especially given the severity of depression and passive suicidal thoughts.  \n4. Address sleep problems through behavioral strategies or medical consultation.  \n5. Establish ongoing monitoring of symptoms, substance use, and safety, with adjustments to treatment as needed.",
