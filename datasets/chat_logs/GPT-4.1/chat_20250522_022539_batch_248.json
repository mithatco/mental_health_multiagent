Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to give us a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas, and I will ask each one carefully. There are no right or wrong answers; I just want to understand how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready for us to begin?"

Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for self-harm or suicide, and consider collaboration with a psychiatrist for medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate trauma-informed psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Develop a safety plan and consider hospitalization if there is an imminent risk of self-harm or if symptoms worsen.  \n4. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services.  \n5. Explore support networks and consider involving family or loved ones in treatment planning, if appropriate.  \n6. Regularly monitor symptoms, including mood, anxiety levels, and substance use, and adjust treatment accordingly.",

Additionally, there is significant anxiety symptomatology marked by constant nervousness, feelings of impending doom, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors (Q7\u2013Q9). Sleep disturbances are notable, characterized by insomnia with frequent awakenings and difficulty maintaining sleep (Q5, Q15). Cognitive concerns are present, including memory impairment and disorientation (Q16), alongside intrusive, distressing thoughts and compulsive-like behaviors such as checking and rituals (Q17\u2013Q18). Experiences of depersonalization or derealization are also reported (Q19), coupled with recent identity confusion and existential distress (Q20).\n\nThe patient\u2019s substance use appears problematic, with regular alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per day and daily cigarette smoking, often exacerbated by anxiety (Q22, Q23). Self-reported use of prescription medications and recreational drugs without medical oversight suggests potential substance misuse or self-medication efforts (Q24). Risk factors include the presence of dark thoughts related to self-harm (Q12), ongoing substance use, and feelings of social isolation. While no active suicidal ideation with intent or plan is explicitly documented, the mention of dark thoughts warrants careful monitoring.\n\nPatterns indicate co-occurring mood, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms, with possible features of obsessive-compulsive tendencies and dissociative experiences. The patient's presentation is complex and suggests severe psychological distress requiring comprehensive assessment and intervention, with particular attention to safety planning around self-harm and substance use.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a deeply distressing picture of your current experience, marked by persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down most of the time</quote> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities. You've described significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, with constant worries, feelings of being on edge, and <sym>panic episodes</sym> that come unexpectedly. Your sleep has been disrupted, with <sym>difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings</sym>, and you've noticed problems with <sym>memory and disorientation</sym>. It\u2019s also clear that you're coping with intrusive thoughts and engaging in repetitive behaviors like checking, and you feel disconnected from yourself and others, which can be very isolating. Your use of alcohol, cigarettes, and self-medication indicates ongoing struggles with <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to manage your emotional pain. Your mention of <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about self-harm highlights the importance of careful attention to your safety and well-being. Overall, you're experiencing a complex mixture of mood, anxiety, cognitive, and dissociative symptoms that are significantly impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe, with anxious distress; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Substance Use Disorder (alcohol and nicotine); Obsessive-Compulsive and Dissociative Symptoms, unspecified; and features suggestive of a possible trauma-related or stress-related disorder**\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness, consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The persistent <sym>anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym> align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive rituals suggest comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive and Dissociative symptoms</med>. The reported <sym>substance use</sym>\u2014including alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription drugs\u2014indicates problematic <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> that may be serving as maladaptive coping strategies. The dissociative experiences and identity confusion point toward features that could be part of a trauma-related or stress-related disorder, although further assessment would be needed for a definitive diagnosis. The presence of dark thoughts about self-harm warrants careful monitoring, even in the absence of active plans or intent. Overall, the presentation is complex, involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, dissociative, and substance-related symptoms, indicating a severe and multifaceted mental health condition requiring comprehensive care.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical assessment, including risk evaluation for self-harm or suicide, and consider collaboration with a psychiatrist for medication management targeting depression, anxiety, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate trauma-informed psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Develop a safety plan and consider hospitalization if there is an imminent risk of self-harm or if symptoms worsen.  \n4. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and referral to specialized addiction services.  \n5. Explore support networks and consider involving family or loved ones in treatment planning, if appropriate.  \n6. Regularly monitor symptoms, including mood, anxiety levels, and substance use, and adjust treatment accordingly.",
