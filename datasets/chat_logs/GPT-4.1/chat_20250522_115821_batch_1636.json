Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that asks about different emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms you've experienced over the past two weeks. Its purpose is to gather information to better understand your mental health and guide any necessary support or treatment. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment involves 23 questions covering various areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and I encourage you to answer as openly and accurately as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed and a sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> about the future. You also mentioned difficulty sleeping, particularly waking up very early and being unable to fall back asleep, which has contributed to fatigue and cognitive challenges like memory issues and feeling disoriented. Your worries and feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> are quite frequent, and you tend to avoid social situations because they make you uncomfortable. Additionally, you experience physical symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, and stomach discomfort, which seem to be linked to your emotional distress. You\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, but without any active plans or intentions, and you do not report any perceptual disturbances like hearing voices. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant mood disturbance with associated anxiety, cognitive concerns, and somatic complaints, impacting your daily functioning and social connections. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your honesty and willingness to share.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and possible cognitive impairment.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting for more than two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbance characterized by early awakening, alongside cognitive symptoms such as memory impairment and disorientation, further supports this diagnosis. The significant <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches are indicative of concurrent <med>Anxious Distress</med> features. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitate careful monitoring but do not currently suggest active intent. No symptoms suggest psychosis or substance misuse, and the symptoms are better explained by a mood disorder rather than a primary medical condition. The cognitive complaints could be related to depression-related slowing or distress, but further assessment may be needed to rule out other neurocognitive conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment for suicidality risk and possible medical conditions contributing to sleep and cognitive symptoms.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, especially one effective for <med>depression with anxious features</med>, along with psychoeducation about mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene strategies or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Regularly reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",

Sleep disturbance is evident, with early morning awakening and difficulty returning to sleep, contributing to fatigue and cognitive complaints. Cognitive concerns include reported memory impairment and disorientation in familiar environments, suggestive of possible cognitive slowing or distress-related cognitive deficits.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, including frequent worry, a sense of ongoing tension, and avoidance behaviors, especially regarding social interactions and crowded settings. Somatic complaints are notable, with recurrent headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nWhile there are no reports of psychotic phenomena or perceptual disturbances, the patient endorses passive suicidal thoughts without active plans or intent, representing a potential risk factor requiring monitoring. No current substance misuse or medication misuse behaviors are identified.\n\nThe patient's responses indicate a pattern of low mood, anhedonia, cognitive impairment, anxiety, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal, all of which are clinically significant and suggest a mood disorder, potentially major depressive disorder with anxious features. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful assessment for safety.\n\nOverall, the clinical picture reflects a complex presentation involving mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic symptoms, with notable social withdrawal and sleep disturbance. Ongoing evaluation of risk factors, particularly suicidal ideation, and a comprehensive diagnostic assessment are recommended to inform targeted intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you\u2019ve been experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed and a sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> about the future. You also mentioned difficulty sleeping, particularly waking up very early and being unable to fall back asleep, which has contributed to fatigue and cognitive challenges like memory issues and feeling disoriented. Your worries and feelings of <sym>anxiety</sym> are quite frequent, and you tend to avoid social situations because they make you uncomfortable. Additionally, you experience physical symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, and stomach discomfort, which seem to be linked to your emotional distress. You\u2019ve acknowledged some <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, but without any active plans or intentions, and you do not report any perceptual disturbances like hearing voices. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant mood disturbance with associated anxiety, cognitive concerns, and somatic complaints, impacting your daily functioning and social connections. I want to acknowledge how difficult this must be for you, and I appreciate your honesty and willingness to share.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Anxious Distress</med> and possible cognitive impairment.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> lasting for more than two weeks, which meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of sleep disturbance characterized by early awakening, alongside cognitive symptoms such as memory impairment and disorientation, further supports this diagnosis. The significant <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches are indicative of concurrent <med>Anxious Distress</med> features. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitate careful monitoring but do not currently suggest active intent. No symptoms suggest psychosis or substance misuse, and the symptoms are better explained by a mood disorder rather than a primary medical condition. The cognitive complaints could be related to depression-related slowing or distress, but further assessment may be needed to rule out other neurocognitive conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including assessment for suicidality risk and possible medical conditions contributing to sleep and cognitive symptoms.  \n2. Consider starting pharmacotherapy with an antidepressant, especially one effective for <med>depression with anxious features</med>, along with psychoeducation about mood and anxiety management.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), focusing on mood, anxiety, and social withdrawal.  \n4. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider sleep hygiene strategies or a referral to a sleep specialist if sleep problems persist.  \n5. Regularly reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response, adjusting interventions as needed.",
