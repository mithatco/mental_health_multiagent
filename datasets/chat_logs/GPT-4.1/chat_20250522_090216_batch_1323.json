The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. I will ask each question, and I'd like you to answer honestly and as best as you can.

You describe persistent <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>. You've been sleeping very little but still feel energized, engaging in more projects and risky behaviors. Anxiety has been a significant issue, with frequent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of social situations. You also report somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>back pain</sym>, along with cognitive difficulties such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <sym>dissociated</sym>. Additionally, you've expressed <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, prescription medications, and recreational drugs. You feel disconnected from yourself and others, and you're struggling with feelings of confusion about your identity and purpose. Your experiences suggest a complex clinical picture that involves mood, anxiety, psychotic-like symptoms, suicidality, and substance misuse, all contributing to significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder) with features of Major Depressive Episode and Hypomanic Symptoms, Anxiety Disorder (possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder), and Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Nicotine, and Other Substances)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>low mood</sym>, alongside episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which are characteristic of <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, excessive <sym>worry</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate significant <med>anxiety</med>. Recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym> suggest possible psychotic or dissociative features, though no overt psychotic symptoms are noted. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants caution. The ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> complicates the picture and may contribute to mood instability and cognitive difficulties. The somatic complaints and feelings of not being understood could be manifestations of underlying <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or somatic manifestations of mood and anxiety symptoms, but further assessment is needed for definitive diagnosis. Overall, this complex symptom profile indicates a need for comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, including screening for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorders</med>, possibly involving collateral information and medical workup.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and monitor for risk of harm, with immediate intervention if necessary.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting mood stabilization (e.g., mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) and manage anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Provide psychotherapy focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and substance use reduction, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  \n5. Address sleep disturbances and somatic complaints through behavioral strategies and medical consultation.  \n6. Offer social support and psychoeducation to reduce isolation and enhance coping skills.",

There is evidence of irritability, impulsivity, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and engagement in risky behaviors, suggestive of mood dysregulation and possible hypomanic or mixed features.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of excessive worry, feelings of being on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, contributing to social withdrawal and functional impairment. Somatic complaints include unexplained headaches and back pain, which may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress or somatization.\n\nCognitive concerns are evident, with reported memory issues and disorientation, alongside experiences of dissociation.

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and behaviors lately. You describe persistent <sym>numbness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>. You've been sleeping very little but still feel energized, engaging in more projects and risky behaviors. Anxiety has been a significant issue, with frequent <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of social situations. You also report somatic symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>back pain</sym>, along with cognitive difficulties such as <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and feeling <sym>dissociated</sym>. Additionally, you've expressed <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and ongoing <sym>substance use</sym>, including alcohol, cigarettes, prescription medications, and recreational drugs. You feel disconnected from yourself and others, and you're struggling with feelings of confusion about your identity and purpose. Your experiences suggest a complex clinical picture that involves mood, anxiety, psychotic-like symptoms, suicidality, and substance misuse, all contributing to significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Bipolar Spectrum Disorder) with features of Major Depressive Episode and Hypomanic Symptoms, Anxiety Disorder (possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder), and Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Nicotine, and Other Substances)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>low mood</sym>, alongside episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors, which are characteristic of <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, excessive <sym>worry</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate significant <med>anxiety</med>. Recurrent <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym> suggest possible psychotic or dissociative features, though no overt psychotic symptoms are noted. The report of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants caution. The ongoing <sym>substance use</sym> complicates the picture and may contribute to mood instability and cognitive difficulties. The somatic complaints and feelings of not being understood could be manifestations of underlying <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> or somatic manifestations of mood and anxiety symptoms, but further assessment is needed for definitive diagnosis. Overall, this complex symptom profile indicates a need for comprehensive evaluation and integrated treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical evaluation, including screening for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorders</med>, possibly involving collateral information and medical workup.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and monitor for risk of harm, with immediate intervention if necessary.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting mood stabilization (e.g., mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics) and manage anxiety symptoms, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Provide psychotherapy focusing on mood regulation, anxiety management, and substance use reduction, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  \n5. Address sleep disturbances and somatic complaints through behavioral strategies and medical consultation.  \n6. Offer social support and psychoeducation to reduce isolation and enhance coping skills.",
