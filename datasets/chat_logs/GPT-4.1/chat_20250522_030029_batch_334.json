The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, supports an anxious component.

Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and risk management, including developing a safety plan if needed.  \n2.

Provide <quote>psychotherapy</quote> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to address depressive, anxious, and cognitive symptoms, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Consider referral to a neuropsychologist for comprehensive cognitive evaluation if cognitive impairment persists or worsens.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely, especially regarding mood, suicidal thoughts, and cognitive functioning, and schedule regular follow-up appointments.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication management.  \n7. Evaluate for possible underlying medical conditions that could contribute to symptoms, such as sleep disorders or neurological issues, and coordinate care with primary medical providers as needed.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia and feelings of emotional numbness, pervasive depressed mood with thoughts of hopelessness, and heightened irritability and anger. The patient reports disrupted sleep patterns characterized by increased sleep duration and ongoing fatigue, alongside notable cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments. \n\nAnxiety symptoms are prominent, including persistent worry, a sense of being on edge, episodic panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors targeting anxiety-provoking situations. Somatic complaints, including frequent headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort, are consistent with stress manifestation. Intrusive ruminative thoughts and transient dissociative experiences further complicate the clinical picture. The patient also reports a sense of identity confusion and social withdrawal, with diminished interest in relationships.\n\nOf particular concern are reports of passive suicidal ideation, with no current mention of active plans or intent but nonetheless warranting close monitoring. No evidence of psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusional thought content is noted. Substance use appears minimal, and no current substance misuse is reported.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, including panic episodes.\n- Cognitive impairments and dissociative experiences suggest possible neurocognitive or mood-related disruptions.\n- Suicidality and feelings of hopelessness are significant risk factors requiring immediate attention.\n- The presence of sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and social withdrawal supports a diagnosis consistent with major depressive episodes with comorbid anxiety features.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal ideation\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness\n- Cognitive disorientation and dissociation\n- Significant functional impairment in social and personal domains\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits a severe affective and anxiety symptomatology characterized by pervasive low mood, anhedonia, cognitive deficits, and panic episodes, compounded by dissociative phenomena and passive suicidal thoughts. The clinical profile necessitates urgent comprehensive assessment and intervention focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, safety planning, and addressing cognitive and dissociative symptoms.",

Adjustment disorder typically involves a maladaptive reaction to a specific stressor with less severe symptomatology and does not usually include the extensive depressive, anxious, and cognitive symptoms described here.

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences. It\u2019s clear that you are going through intense feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which are significantly impacting your daily life. You\u2019re also experiencing <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as forgetfulness and feeling disoriented, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>. Your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and social withdrawal indicate a high level of emotional distress. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> is particularly concerning and warrants careful attention and support. It\u2019s understandable that you feel overwhelmed and uncertain about how to manage these feelings right now, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge the courage it takes to share this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features and <med>Cognitive Impairment</med> (possibly related to depression or comorbid neurocognitive issues), with <med>Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, supports an anxious component. Cognitive complaints such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and <sym>disorientation</sym> suggest possible neurocognitive involvement, which can occur in severe depression or as a separate comorbid condition. The report of <sym>dissociation</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> may indicate severity and complexity of the mood disorder, possibly involving trauma-related features. The <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> highlight the need for urgent safety assessment, but no active plans or intent are reported. Overall, the constellation of symptoms best fits a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with significant distress and comorbid anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and risk management, including developing a safety plan if needed.  \n2. Initiate or adjust <med>antidepressant</med> medication, considering agents effective for both depression and anxiety, under psychiatric supervision.  \n3. Provide <quote>psychotherapy</quote> such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to address depressive, anxious, and cognitive symptoms, and to develop coping strategies.  \n4. Consider referral to a neuropsychologist for comprehensive cognitive evaluation if cognitive impairment persists or worsens.  \n5. Monitor symptoms closely, especially regarding mood, suicidal thoughts, and cognitive functioning, and schedule regular follow-up appointments.  \n6. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, medication management.  \n7. Evaluate for possible underlying medical conditions that could contribute to symptoms, such as sleep disorders or neurological issues, and coordinate care with primary medical providers as needed.",
