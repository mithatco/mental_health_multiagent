It sounds like you've been navigating quite a bit lately, with significant mood swings that include periods of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical tension</sym>. You've also described episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> involving <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and increased energy, which seem to happen in cycles. Alongside these mood shifts, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and some <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>. You\u2019ve mentioned <quote>passive thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> and some difficulties with concentration and memory, especially during low periods. It\u2019s understandable that these fluctuations and distressing thoughts are challenging for you, and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with <sym>current depressive episode</sym> and comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes recurrent episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, alongside periods of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and increased goal-directed activity. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, and the pattern of mood episodes lasting at least four days with symptoms that are noticeable but not severely impairing, align with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and intrusive thoughts suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med>. The patient's report of <quote>passive thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> warrants ongoing risk monitoring but does not currently indicate active suicidal intent. The mood fluctuations and behaviors fit well within a bipolar spectrum diagnosis, with no evidence of full manic episodes needed for <med>Bipolar I</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for any underlying or co-occurring conditions.  \n2. Consider starting mood stabilization treatment, such as a <med>mood stabilizer</med> (e.g., lithium, valproate) or other appropriate pharmacotherapy, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help manage mood swings, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Regularly monitor for suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviors, especially given the passive thoughts reported, and develop a safety plan as needed.  \n5. Address anxiety symptoms through psychoeducation, relaxation techniques, or medication if appropriate, in coordination with mental health providers.",

The patient reports persistent anxiety, irritability, and irritability-related interpersonal difficulties, as well as episodes of psychomotor agitation during manic phases. Notable somatic complaints include physical tension-related aches and pains, alongside concentration and memory difficulties that fluctuate with mood states.\n\nIntrusive thoughts related to health and loss of control are evident, alongside occasional passive suicidal ideation without specific plans. The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations but acknowledges dissociative experiences of depersonalization or derealization during periods of heightened emotional distress. Social withdrawal and diminished interest in relationships are reported, particularly during depressive and irritable episodes.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include mood disorder with bipolar features, given the history of both hypomanic and depressive symptoms, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. The presence of impulsivity and risky behaviors during manic episodes warrants attention. The patient\u2019s self-harm thoughts, although passive, constitute a risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**  \n- Fluctuating mood states with manic and depressive symptoms  \n- Passive suicidal ideation  \n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes  \n- Intrusive and obsessive thoughts causing distress  \n- Social withdrawal and diminished functioning during affective episodes\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe patient's symptom profile suggests a mood disorder with bipolar features, characterized by alternating episodes of depression and hypomania, accompanied by anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and somatic complaints. Ongoing assessment of suicidal risk, mood stability, and functional impairment is recommended, with attention to comorbid anxiety and stress management.",

The reasoning provided aligns well with the clinical presentation expected in bipolar conditions, and the diagnosis references key features such as mood swings, hypomanic episodes, and depressive symptoms. Although the presentation also includes anxiety, the primary diagnosis remains bipolar, matching the expected profile.",

      "predicted": "Thank you for sharing your experiences openly. It sounds like you've been navigating quite a bit lately, with significant mood swings that include periods of <sym>depressive feelings</sym> characterized by <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical tension</sym>. You've also described episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> involving <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and increased energy, which seem to happen in cycles. Alongside these mood shifts, you experience <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and some <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>. You\u2019ve mentioned <quote>passive thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> and some difficulties with concentration and memory, especially during low periods. It\u2019s understandable that these fluctuations and distressing thoughts are challenging for you, and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar II disorder</med> with <sym>current depressive episode</sym> and comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes recurrent episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, alongside periods of <sym>hypomanic symptoms</sym> characterized by <sym>elevated mood</sym>, <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, <sym>risk-taking behaviors</sym>, and increased goal-directed activity. The absence of <sym>psychotic features</sym>, and the pattern of mood episodes lasting at least four days with symptoms that are noticeable but not severely impairing, align with <med>Bipolar II disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and intrusive thoughts suggests comorbid <med>Anxiety disorder</med>. The patient's report of <quote>passive thoughts of hurting yourself</quote> warrants ongoing risk monitoring but does not currently indicate active suicidal intent. The mood fluctuations and behaviors fit well within a bipolar spectrum diagnosis, with no evidence of full manic episodes needed for <med>Bipolar I</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess for any underlying or co-occurring conditions.  \n2. Consider starting mood stabilization treatment, such as a <med>mood stabilizer</med> (e.g., lithium, valproate) or other appropriate pharmacotherapy, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n3. Refer for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)</med>, to help manage mood swings, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Regularly monitor for suicidal ideation or self-harm behaviors, especially given the passive thoughts reported, and develop a safety plan as needed.  \n5. Address anxiety symptoms through psychoeducation, relaxation techniques, or medication if appropriate, in coordination with mental health providers.",
