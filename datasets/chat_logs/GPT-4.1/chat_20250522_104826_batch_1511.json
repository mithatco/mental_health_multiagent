This assessment helps us understand your current mental health symptoms across various areas, which can inform any support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I will ask each one individually. There's no right or wrong answer \u2014 just answer honestly based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready for me to begin?"

You\u2019ve also shared that you often feel <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, worrying about the future and feeling overwhelmed at times. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you've noticed some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve described physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, which may be linked to stress. Importantly, you\u2019ve acknowledged occasional <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to not keep going, though you have no intent or plans to act on these. Your withdrawal from social connections and feelings of disconnection are also concerning, and these all suggest a complex emotional experience that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Mixed Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with criteria for <med>major depression</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (hypersomnia and poor sleep quality), and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and moments of <sym>disconnection from self or surroundings</sym> suggest some dissociative features or emotional numbness, which can occur in severe depression. The occasional <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to cease functioning, without active suicidal intent, are important to monitor but do not currently meet criteria for <med>suicidal ideation with plan or intent</med>. The physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomach aches, could be psychosomatic manifestations of depression or anxiety. Overall, the combination of mood, cognitive, behavioral, and somatic symptoms points toward a severe depressive episode with mixed features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for suicidality and establish safety plans as needed.  \n2. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to consider the initiation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>.  \n3. Encourage engagement in psychoeducation about depression and techniques for managing anxiety and stress.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and any emergence of suicidal thoughts or worsening mood.",

These symptoms are accompanied by notable psychomotor changes, including increased fatigue despite hypersomnia, and cognitive concerns such as forgetfulness and disconnection from self and environment, suggestive of possible cognitive or affective dysregulation. \n\nThe patient reports heightened anxiety and irritability, with avoidance behaviors in social settings, alongside somatic complaints including headaches and stomach aches, which may reflect psychosomatic factors or heightened stress levels. There are also indications of intrusive negative thoughts and ruminations, as well as episodes of emotional overwhelm and feelings of being out of control, which could suggest comorbid anxiety symptoms or underlying affective instability.\n\nWhile no active suicidal intent is disclosed, the presence of dark thoughts and feelings of despair warrants careful monitoring for suicide risk. The patient\u2019s substance use appears limited and non-problematic at this time, with occasional smoking and minimal alcohol consumption.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Prominent depressive symptoms (anhedonia, hopelessness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal)\n- Anxiety symptoms (worry, avoidance, feelings of being overwhelmed)\n- Cognitive and perceptual disturbances (dissociation, feelings of detachment)\n- Somatic complaints potentially linked to psychological distress\n- No current evidence of psychosis or substance misuse\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Persistent depressive mood and hopelessness\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and dissociative experiences\n- Expressed thoughts of wishing to cease functioning, albeit without active suicidal plans\n- Social withdrawal and emotional numbness\n\n**Summary:**\nThis clinical presentation suggests a major depressive episode with comorbid features of generalized anxiety and dissociative symptoms. The patient exhibits a high level of psychological distress, with potential risk factors for suicidality that merit ongoing assessment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed risk assessment and exploration of functional impairment, is recommended to inform appropriate treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a significant level of emotional distress and physical discomfort over the past two weeks. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities, and a sense of <sym>being lost or disconnected from yourself</sym>. You\u2019ve also shared that you often feel <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym>, worrying about the future and feeling overwhelmed at times. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you've noticed some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. Additionally, you\u2019ve described physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches, which may be linked to stress. Importantly, you\u2019ve acknowledged occasional <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to not keep going, though you have no intent or plans to act on these. Your withdrawal from social connections and feelings of disconnection are also concerning, and these all suggest a complex emotional experience that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Mixed Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report indicates persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with criteria for <med>major depression</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (hypersomnia and poor sleep quality), and cognitive issues like <sym>forgetfulness</sym> further support this diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and moments of <sym>disconnection from self or surroundings</sym> suggest some dissociative features or emotional numbness, which can occur in severe depression. The occasional <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about wishing to cease functioning, without active suicidal intent, are important to monitor but do not currently meet criteria for <med>suicidal ideation with plan or intent</med>. The physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomach aches, could be psychosomatic manifestations of depression or anxiety. Overall, the combination of mood, cognitive, behavioral, and somatic symptoms points toward a severe depressive episode with mixed features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for suicidality and establish safety plans as needed.  \n2. Refer for a psychiatric evaluation to consider the initiation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>.  \n3. Encourage engagement in psychoeducation about depression and techniques for managing anxiety and stress.  \n4. Address sleep issues through behavioral strategies and consider medical evaluation if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and any emergence of suicidal thoughts or worsening mood.",
