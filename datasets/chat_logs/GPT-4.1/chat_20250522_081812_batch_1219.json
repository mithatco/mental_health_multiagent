Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to assess various areas of mental health over the past two weeks. Its purpose is to gather information that can help us understand what you might be experiencing and guide any further support or treatment you might need. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, non-judgmental space for you to express yourself. The assessment will involve me asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I'd like you to answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

Evaluate sleep patterns and provide guidance on sleep hygiene; consider a sleep study if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Monitor cognitive symptoms and consider neuropsychological testing if memory and disorientation continue or worsen.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, emphasizing the importance of ongoing support and treatment adherence.",

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and emotional numbness, persistent feelings of sadness, worthlessness, and hopelessness, as well as irritability and increased emotional reactivity. Sleep disturbances are notable, characterized by hypersomnia and fragmented sleep, contributing to ongoing fatigue. Cognitive concerns are evident through reported memory difficulties and disorientation in familiar environments, suggestive of possible attentional or executive functioning impairments. The patient reports heightened anxiety, worry, and avoidance behaviors, particularly in social and crowded settings, alongside somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches linked to stress. Experiences of depersonalization or derealization are described as episodic, alongside negative ruminative thoughts. Social withdrawal and decreased engagement in relationships are evident. Importantly, there are no indications of psychotic symptoms, suicidal or homicidal ideation, or substance misuse. Risk factors include persistent affective symptoms, functional impairment, and social withdrawal, warranting further assessment of mood and anxiety disorder severity and functional impact. The overall clinical picture underscores the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and targeted intervention to address mood, anxiety, and cognitive concerns.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently, including persistent <sym>feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional numbness</sym>. You also described <sym>difficulty enjoying activities you once enjoyed</sym> and feeling <sym>detached or outside of yourself</sym> at times. Your sleep has been irregular, with <sym>trouble falling asleep and waking up multiple times</sym>, which leaves you feeling <sym>tired and fatigued</sym>. You have noticed <sym>memory issues and occasional disorientation in familiar places</sym>, which concern you. Anxiety has been significant, with <sym>constant worry, feeling on edge, and avoiding certain situations</sym>. You also mentioned physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and stomachaches linked to stress</sym>. Despite these difficulties, you deny any <sym>thoughts of self-harm or hearing voices</sym>. Your social withdrawal and questioning of your identity suggest a complex emotional state that impacts your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder \u2013 Major Depressive Disorder</med> with prominent <med>Anxiety Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness, and hopelessness</sym>, along with significant sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive concerns such as memory issues and disorientation. The presence of <sym>persistent worry, avoidance behaviors, and physical stress symptoms</sym> supports the diagnosis of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> co-occurring with depression. The episodic feelings of <sym>detachment and depersonalization</sym> further suggest a complex affective picture. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation</sym> simplifies the diagnosis, but the severity of symptoms warrants clinical attention. These symptoms collectively point toward <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Distress</med> features, impacting the patient's functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive clinical assessment, including standardized depression and anxiety rating scales, to gauge severity and functional impairment.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as a <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</med> or other appropriate antidepressant, tailored to the patient's profile.  \n3. Refer the patient for psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to help address negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and manage anxiety.  \n4. Evaluate sleep patterns and provide guidance on sleep hygiene; consider a sleep study if sleep disturbances persist.  \n5. Monitor cognitive symptoms and consider neuropsychological testing if memory and disorientation continue or worsen.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, emphasizing the importance of ongoing support and treatment adherence.",
