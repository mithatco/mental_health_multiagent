These mood swings appear to significantly impact your daily functioning, with some days feeling overwhelming and others characterized by bursts of confidence and activity. You also mention symptoms like <sym>irritability, anxiety, somatic complaints, intrusive thoughts, and occasional thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which further contribute to your distress. It\u2019s understandable that managing these fluctuating moods and physical symptoms is challenging, and your openness in sharing these experiences is an important step toward understanding what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder, including episodes of <med>hypomania</med> and <med>major depression</med></med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>\u2014such as <quote>feeling hopeless, disinterested, and withdrawing from social activities</quote>\u2014as well as periods of <sym>elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and increased energy</sym>.

The presence of <sym>irritability, anxiety, somatic complaints, intrusive thoughts, and occasional fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> aligns with the complex mood dysregulation seen in bipolar spectrum conditions. While some symptoms may overlap with other disorders, the combination of episodic mood elevation and depression, along with impulsivity and risky behaviors, supports a diagnosis of <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. The patient's substance use during low moods may serve as a maladaptive coping strategy, but it does not fully explain the full range of mood episodes.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess history, and evaluate for comorbid conditions.  \n2. Develop a mood stabilization plan, potentially including pharmacotherapy such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, tailored to the patient's specific symptoms.  \n3. Consider psychotherapy approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and stress.  \n4. Address substance use behaviors through psychoeducation and support, and monitor their impact on mood episodes.  \n5. Establish a safety plan to monitor and manage risks related to <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ensure support during mood episodes.  \n6. Encourage regular sleep routines and lifestyle adjustments to help stabilize mood fluctuations.",

Key features include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, suggestive of depressive symptomatology, along with reports of decreased need for sleep, increased energy, impulsivity, and engagement in risky behaviors during elevated mood states, consistent with hypomanic or manic episodes. The patient reports irritability, heightened anxiety, and somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort, which may be somatic manifestations of mood instability or stress-related factors.\n\nPatterns observed include fluctuations in sleep patterns correlating with mood states, impulsive behaviors such as unrestrained spending, and social withdrawal during depressive episodes. Intrusive thoughts, brief suicidal ideation without active plans, and recent alcohol use during low moods are noted, raising concern for mood disorder with mixed features and potential substance use as a maladaptive coping mechanism.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Presence of suicidal thoughts without current intent\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors during hypomanic episodes\n- Substance use (alcohol) in conjunction with mood fluctuations\n- Social withdrawal and decreased engagement with support networks\n- Somatic complaints and perceived invalidation of physical symptoms\n\nOverall, the clinical presentation aligns with a bipolar spectrum disorder, exhibiting significant mood dysregulation, impulsivity, and associated psychosomatic concerns. Continuous monitoring for suicidal ideation, substance use, and the severity of mood episodes is indicated. Further assessment should include a comprehensive psychiatric history, risk assessment, and consideration of differential diagnoses such as mood disorder with mixed features or comorbid anxiety disorder.",

The described symptoms\u2014mood swings, depressive episodes, hypomanic symptoms, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and mood impact\u2014are characteristic of bipolar disorder.

      "predicted": "You seem to be experiencing a wide range of intense and fluctuating emotions, including periods of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless, disconnected from interests, and withdrawing from others</quote>. At the same time, you report episodes of <sym>elevated energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> during your hypomanic or manic phases. These mood swings appear to significantly impact your daily functioning, with some days feeling overwhelming and others characterized by bursts of confidence and activity. You also mention symptoms like <sym>irritability, anxiety, somatic complaints, intrusive thoughts, and occasional thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which further contribute to your distress. It\u2019s understandable that managing these fluctuating moods and physical symptoms is challenging, and your openness in sharing these experiences is an important step toward understanding what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Spectrum Disorder, including episodes of <med>hypomania</med> and <med>major depression</med></med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>\u2014such as <quote>feeling hopeless, disinterested, and withdrawing from social activities</quote>\u2014as well as periods of <sym>elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, risky behaviors, and increased energy</sym>. The mood shifts are persistent and impactful, with some episodes lasting for days to weeks, consistent with <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>irritability, anxiety, somatic complaints, intrusive thoughts, and occasional fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym> aligns with the complex mood dysregulation seen in bipolar spectrum conditions. While some symptoms may overlap with other disorders, the combination of episodic mood elevation and depression, along with impulsivity and risky behaviors, supports a diagnosis of <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>. The patient's substance use during low moods may serve as a maladaptive coping strategy, but it does not fully explain the full range of mood episodes.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess history, and evaluate for comorbid conditions.  \n2. Develop a mood stabilization plan, potentially including pharmacotherapy such as mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics, tailored to the patient's specific symptoms.  \n3. Consider psychotherapy approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychoeducation, to help manage mood swings, impulsivity, and stress.  \n4. Address substance use behaviors through psychoeducation and support, and monitor their impact on mood episodes.  \n5. Establish a safety plan to monitor and manage risks related to <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and ensure support during mood episodes.  \n6. Encourage regular sleep routines and lifestyle adjustments to help stabilize mood fluctuations.",
