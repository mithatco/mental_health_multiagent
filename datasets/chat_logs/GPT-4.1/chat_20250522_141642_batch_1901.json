We'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a brief questionnaire designed to get an overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing.

Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be honest about your experiences. I will be asking you a series of 23 questions, one at a time, about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

You also shared that your physical symptoms, such as headaches and muscle aches, seem related to your tense state, and you feel misunderstood or dismissed by others.

The intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors, align with <med>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> point to dissociative features, which can co-occur with anxiety and mood disorders. The physical complaints like headaches and muscle tension are common somatic manifestations of anxiety and stress. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants careful monitoring but without current intent or plan, making this a complex presentation with multiple overlapping features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, under medical supervision.  \n3. Consider psychotherapy options, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or referral to a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of social support.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",

Key concerns include pervasive anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of depressive symptomatology. The reported irritability, emotional lability, and sleep disturbances\u2014characterized by decreased sleep duration without fatigue\u2014may further support a mood disorder with possible agitation or mixed features. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, evidenced by persistent worry, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension, indicative of generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.\n\nObsessive-compulsive symptoms are reported, including intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors like hand-washing and checking, which appear to serve a maladaptive anxiety-reducing function. The patient also experiences derealization or depersonalization episodes, indicating dissociative symptoms, alongside difficulties with memory and orientation during heightened states of distress.\n\nRisk factors of concern include passive suicidal ideation (\"dark thoughts\" about not waking up) without current intent or plan, which warrants close monitoring. The patient's social withdrawal and emotional detachment further compound clinical concerns regarding potential social isolation and diminished support.\n\nPatterns of response reveal concurrent mood dysregulation, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociative experiences, suggesting a complex, multi-symptom presentation that may require integrated, multi-modal intervention. No substance use or psychotic symptoms are evident at this time.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits significant depressive, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms with passive suicidal ideation, necessitating comprehensive assessment, safety planning, and targeted treatment considerations.",

      "expected": "ocd",
      "predicted": "You have shared a challenging mixture of symptoms that suggest you're experiencing significant emotional distress. You described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, along with persistent <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. Your sleep patterns are disrupted, with <sym>little sleep</sym> but without feeling tired, and you experience <sym>restlessness</sym>. Anxiety appears to be a major component, with ongoing <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations. You also have intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, accompanied by <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> like hand-washing and checking. Additionally, you feel <sym>dissociated</sym> at times, experiencing numbness and detachment, and have moments of feeling lost or disconnected from your identity. Importantly, you mentioned <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>, which is a serious concern requiring careful attention. You also shared that your physical symptoms, such as headaches and muscle aches, seem related to your tense state, and you feel misunderstood or dismissed by others. It sounds like you're going through a lot, and these symptoms are impacting your daily life and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with features of depression and irritability, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and dissociative experiences (provisional diagnosis)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>energy</sym> levels, along with passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, support a mood disorder diagnosis. The marked <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> are characteristic of <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The intrusive <sym>thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, coupled with compulsive behaviors, align with <med>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> point to dissociative features, which can co-occur with anxiety and mood disorders. The physical complaints like headaches and muscle tension are common somatic manifestations of anxiety and stress. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts warrants careful monitoring but without current intent or plan, making this a complex presentation with multiple overlapping features.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and safety planning.  \n2. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting depression and anxiety, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, under medical supervision.  \n3. Consider psychotherapy options, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies or referral to a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, emphasizing the importance of social support.  \n6. Schedule close follow-up to monitor symptoms, safety, and treatment response.",
