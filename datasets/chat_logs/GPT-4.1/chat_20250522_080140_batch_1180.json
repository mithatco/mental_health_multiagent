Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I will ask them one at a time. There's no right or wrong answer; I just want to understand how you've been feeling lately. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

Your sleep issues, including <sym>trouble falling asleep</sym> and <sym>waking up multiple times</sym>, are affecting your overall well-being, and you\u2019ve noted some <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, your report of <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomach aches</sym>, and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates significant distress and risk factors that need careful attention. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming, and your honesty is an important step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>.

The report of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, without current plans, highlights a risk that warrants monitoring. The cognitive symptoms, including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and transient <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, further support a mood disorder with notable anxiety components. These symptoms are consistent with a clinical picture that may qualify as a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, but further assessment would clarify the full scope and severity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to determine the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, including screening for suicidality and risk assessment.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive self-harm thoughts</sym> and establish regular monitoring of risk.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) and evaluate the need for <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants) based on clinical judgment.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Explore additional supports, including social connection and stress management strategies, to enhance overall functioning.",

These affective symptoms are accompanied by significant anxiety, evidenced by chronic worry about the future, social avoidance, and feeling tense and on edge. The patient also describes irritability, mood lability, and intrusive negative thoughts, suggestive of comorbid mood and anxiety features.\n\nSleep disturbances are prominent, with reports of difficulty initiating sleep, frequent awakenings, and fatigue despite increased sleep duration, which may indicate sleep fragmentation or dysregulation. Cognitive concerns are notable, including forgetfulness and disorientation in familiar environments, possibly reflecting cognitive impairment or concentration difficulties associated with mood or anxiety pathology.\n\nSomatic complaints include daily headaches and stomach aches, which may be stress-related or somatic manifestations of psychological distress. The patient admits to some passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts of hurting oneself\") without current plans, representing a significant risk factor requiring careful monitoring.\n\nThere are also transient dissociative experiences (feeling disconnected from oneself and surroundings) and feelings of identity confusion, which may warrant further assessment for dissociative symptoms or underlying trauma-related issues.\n\nBehaviorally, the patient has withdrawn from social interactions and exhibits reduced engagement in activities and routines. Substance use appears limited, with minimal alcohol consumption and no tobacco or medication misuse reported.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include mood and anxiety disorder symptoms, passive suicidal ideation, somatic complaints, cognitive disturbances, and dissociative experiences. These findings suggest a complex presentation with overlapping mood, anxiety, and possibly dissociative features, requiring comprehensive evaluation and safety monitoring.",

It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a difficult time, feeling persistent <sym>sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>numbness</sym>. You also mention significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and worries about the future, along with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>. Your sleep issues, including <sym>trouble falling asleep</sym> and <sym>waking up multiple times</sym>, are affecting your overall well-being, and you\u2019ve noted some <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. Additionally, your report of <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomach aches</sym>, and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> indicates significant distress and risk factors that need careful attention. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming, and your honesty is an important step toward seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with co-occurring Anxiety Symptoms and Passive Suicidal Ideation</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and feelings of <sym>numbness</sym> align with a <med>major depressive episode</med>. The presence of <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach aches</sym> suggest significant <med>anxiety</med> features. The report of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, without current plans, highlights a risk that warrants monitoring. The cognitive symptoms, including <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and transient <sym>dissociative feelings</sym>, further support a mood disorder with notable anxiety components. These symptoms are consistent with a clinical picture that may qualify as a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, but further assessment would clarify the full scope and severity.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical evaluation to determine the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, including screening for suicidality and risk assessment.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>passive self-harm thoughts</sym> and establish regular monitoring of risk.  \n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy) and evaluate the need for <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants) based on clinical judgment.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through sleep hygiene education and, if necessary, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Explore additional supports, including social connection and stress management strategies, to enhance overall functioning.",
