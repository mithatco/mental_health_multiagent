Today, we will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a way to get a broad picture of different areas of your mental health. This assessment helps us understand what you're experiencing so we can figure out the best way to support you. I want to assure you that everything you share is confidential and that this is a safe space for you to be honest. The assessment includes 23 questions about various mental health symptoms you've experienced over the past two weeks. I'll ask you each question one at a time, and you can tell me about your experiences in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

In addition, you've mentioned experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors like repeated <sym>handwashing</sym> and checking.

Importantly, you disclosed occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, though not with active intent or plan. Overall, your experience appears to involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, which have caused significant distress and interference in your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors such as repetitive handwashing and checking, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, like feeling detached, further support a complex presentation involving dissociative features. While there are no indications of psychosis or active suicidality with intent, the presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful monitoring. The overall picture suggests a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, requiring careful assessment for severity and functional impact.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or persist.  \n4. Implement safety planning and monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or self-harm risk.  \n5. Explore additional support options, including psychoeducation and possible referral to a psychiatrist or specialized mental health services.",

There is a notable presence of anxiety features, including chronic worry, situational avoidance, and episodic waves of unexplained fear. Cognitive concerns are evident through reported memory difficulties and episodes of dissociation, such as feeling detached from oneself and the environment. Intrusive thoughts related to contamination and harm, alongside compulsive behaviors like repeated handwashing and checking, suggest the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The patient also reports somatic complaints including tension-related headaches and muscle aches, which may reflect heightened physiological arousal.\n\nResponse patterns reveal consistent endorsement of depressive and anxious symptoms over the past two weeks, with some insight into these experiences. No reports of psychotic phenomena or substance misuse were indicated, and there are no immediate indications of active suicidality beyond occasional thoughts of self-harm under distress. Risk factors include ongoing hopelessness, intrusive thoughts, and self-injurious ideation; however, no current intent or plan was disclosed.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation suggests comorbid mood and anxiety symptomatology with obsessive-compulsive features and dissociative experiences. Further comprehensive assessment and monitoring for suicidality and functional impairment are recommended to inform diagnostic clarification and treatment planning.",

      "expected": "ocd",
      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms. You've noted feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, and a pervasive sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with worries that feel overwhelming and avoidance of certain situations that heighten your distress. Physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>muscle tension</sym> have been persistent. In addition, you've mentioned experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors like repeated <sym>handwashing</sym> and checking. You have also reported episodes of feeling <sym>detached from yourself</sym> or your surroundings, and some difficulties with <sym>memory</sym>. Importantly, you disclosed occasional <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, though not with active intent or plan. Overall, your experience appears to involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, which have caused significant distress and interference in your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Episode) with comorbid Anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of chronic <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The intrusive thoughts about contamination and harm, along with compulsive behaviors such as repetitive handwashing and checking, are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The episodes of <sym>dissociation</sym>, like feeling detached, further support a complex presentation involving dissociative features. While there are no indications of psychosis or active suicidality with intent, the presence of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful monitoring. The overall picture suggests a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, requiring careful assessment for severity and functional impact.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), targeting depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), especially if symptoms significantly impair functioning or persist.  \n4. Implement safety planning and monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> or self-harm risk.  \n5. Explore additional support options, including psychoeducation and possible referral to a psychiatrist or specialized mental health services.",
