Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This questionnaire is designed to give us a broad overview of various mental health symptoms you might be experiencing, across different areas such as mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open and honest. The assessment will involve me asking you 23 questions, and I would like you to answer each one based on how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. If you're ready, we can begin with the first question."

      "content": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently. You feel <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> that once brought you joy, and you've been feeling <sym>depressed, hopeless, and overwhelmed</sym>. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability and irritability</sym> and are sleeping less despite feeling restless and having a lot of energy, which can be exhausting. You also described persistent <sym>intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and rituals</sym> that are draining, along with ongoing <sym>anxiety, worry, and episodes of panic</sym>. You have physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and muscle pains</sym> without clear medical causes and sometimes feel <sym>disconnected or detached from yourself or your surroundings</sym>. You mentioned feeling <sym>socially isolated and withdrawn</sym> and have occasional <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although without active plans. Overall, your symptoms involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, somatic, and dissociative experiences, which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> and <med>Anxiety Features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts, compulsive rituals, and related distress</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, racing thoughts, episodic panic, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and muscle pains</sym> indicate significant <med>generalized anxiety</med> and <sym>panic symptoms</sym>. The dissociative experiences, like feeling <sym>detached from oneself</sym>, further support a complex presentation involving dissociative features often associated with anxiety or trauma-related responses. Given the duration and severity of symptoms affecting multiple domains, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive and Anxiety Features</med> best captures the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any underlying medical conditions.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), tailored to address depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a focus on mood regulation, exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD, and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions or consultation with a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning, especially given the reported fleeting thoughts of self-harm.  \n6. Explore social support and consider group therapy or community resources to reduce feelings of isolation.",

Significant mood disturbances are evidenced by reports of irritability (Q4), low energy despite decreased sleep (Q5), and episodic panic or anxiety (Q7, Q8). Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors consistent with obsessive-compulsive symptoms are reported, including contamination fears and ritualistic handwashing/checking (Q17, Q18), alongside distress related to intrusive cognitions.\n\nThe patient also reports somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and muscle pains (Q10), coupled with sleep disturbances characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep and daytime fatigue (Q15). Dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected or outside of oneself (Q19), are noted. There is evidence of heightened anxiety and avoidance behaviors (Q9), as well as feelings of emotional isolation and social withdrawal.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include:\n- Major depressive disorder, characterized by anhedonia, hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Obsessive-compulsive disorder, evidenced by intrusive thoughts and compulsive rituals.\n- Generalized anxiety disorder or panic symptoms, with reports of persistent worry, racing thoughts, and episodic panic.\n- Somatic symptom concerns with associated distress.\n- Dissociative experiences, potentially related to anxiety or trauma.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Occasional suicidal ideation without current intent or planning (Q12).\n- Feelings of emotional and social disconnection.\n- Elevated anxiety and agitation.\n\nOverall, the assessment reveals a complex presentation of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and dissociative symptoms, warranting a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and integrated treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently. You feel <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> that once brought you joy, and you've been feeling <sym>depressed, hopeless, and overwhelmed</sym>. You've noticed increased <sym>irritability and irritability</sym> and are sleeping less despite feeling restless and having a lot of energy, which can be exhausting. You also described persistent <sym>intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and rituals</sym> that are draining, along with ongoing <sym>anxiety, worry, and episodes of panic</sym>. You have physical symptoms like <sym>headaches and muscle pains</sym> without clear medical causes and sometimes feel <sym>disconnected or detached from yourself or your surroundings</sym>. You mentioned feeling <sym>socially isolated and withdrawn</sym> and have occasional <sym>fleeting thoughts of self-harm</sym>, although without active plans. Overall, your symptoms involve a complex interplay of mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, somatic, and dissociative experiences, which significantly impact your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate to Severe</med> with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms</med> and <med>Anxiety Features>\n\n**Reasoning:** The presentation includes persistent <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal</sym>, lasting over two weeks, which aligns with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts, compulsive rituals, and related distress</sym> suggest comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, racing thoughts, episodic panic, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches and muscle pains</sym> indicate significant <med>generalized anxiety</med> and <sym>panic symptoms</sym>. The dissociative experiences, like feeling <sym>detached from oneself</sym>, further support a complex presentation involving dissociative features often associated with anxiety or trauma-related responses. Given the duration and severity of symptoms affecting multiple domains, a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Obsessive-Compulsive and Anxiety Features</med> best captures the overall clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnoses and assess for any underlying medical conditions.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an antidepressant (e.g., SSRI or SNRI), tailored to address depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n3. Recommend psychotherapy, including Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a focus on mood regulation, exposure and response prevention (ERP) for OCD, and anxiety management strategies.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions or consultation with a sleep specialist if needed.  \n5. Monitor for suicidal ideation and ensure safety planning, especially given the reported fleeting thoughts of self-harm.  \n6. Explore social support and consider group therapy or community resources to reduce feelings of isolation.",
