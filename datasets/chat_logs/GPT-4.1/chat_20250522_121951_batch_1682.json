This assessment helps us get a broad understanding of your mental health over the past two weeks across different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. It's completely confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences honestly. The assessment includes 23 questions covering various aspects of mental health, and I'll be asking each one in order. There's no need to rush, and you're welcome to share as much detail as you'd like. Let's begin with the first question."

You also notice physical symptoms such as <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>stress-related pains</sym>, along with sleep disturbances that vary depending on your mood state. In your manic episodes, you describe a <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, heightened <sym>energy</sym>, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors. Anxiety symptoms, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>panic-like sensations</sym>, are also present, especially during mood transitions. Your occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use are important to consider, as they add to the complexity of your presentation. It\u2019s clear you are navigating significant mood swings and associated symptoms that require careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode manic, severe with mixed features, moderate severity, with current mild depressive symptoms and anxiety features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>\u2014including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, hopelessness, and social withdrawal\u2014and episodes of <sym>mania</sym> characterized by <sym>decreased sleep</sym>, increased <sym>goal-directed activity</sym>, impulsivity, and elevated energy support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>mixed features</sym> is suggested by the overlapping symptoms of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> occurring in close succession, and the mood swings appear to be episodic rather than chronic. The patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> further complicate the clinical picture but are common comorbid features. The absence of persistent psychotic symptoms or hallucinations makes <med>schizoaffective disorder</med> less likely. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes, impulsivity, and episodic nature aligns with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and develop a tailored treatment plan.\n2. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood swings and prevent relapse.\n3. Consider adding or optimizing adjunctive treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), and treatment for anxiety symptoms.\n4. Monitor closely for suicidal ideation and substance use, providing crisis resources or safety planning as needed.\n5. Educate about the importance of medication adherence, regular sleep routines, and recognizing early signs of mood episodes.\n6.

During depressive episodes, the patient reports anhedonia (Q1), persistent feelings of hopelessness and low mood (Q2), social withdrawal (Q20), and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness and confusion (Q15). Somatic complaints include unexplained aches and tension-related pains (Q9), with sleep disturbances manifesting as hypersomnia or insomnia depending on mood state (Q14). Intrusive negative thoughts and ruminations are evident (Q16), alongside feelings of detachment or dissociation (Q18), which may indicate dissociative features or severe stress response.\n\nConversely, during manic episodes, the patient describes decreased need for sleep (Q4), increased goal-directed activity and risk-taking behaviors (Q5), elevated energy levels, irritability (Q3), and impulsivity, including impulsive spending and project initiation. Anxiety symptoms are also present, particularly in mood transition periods (Q6), with reports of panic-like sensations and avoidance behaviors related to social anxiety (Q7, Q8). The patient admits to fleeting suicidal thoughts without current plans (Q11) and occasional substance use (marijuana, alcohol, tobacco) that appears to be primarily for self-medication.\n\nPatterns indicate mood-dependent symptomatology with clear episodic mood swings ranging from depressive to manic states, accompanied by associated behavioral, cognitive, and somatic symptoms. The patient\u2019s substance use and self-reported dissociation are noteworthy for clinical risk assessment. No hallucinations or persistent psychotic features are reported.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety features, dissociative experiences, and current passive suicidal ideation. Risks include mood instability, impulsivity, substance use, and transient suicidal thoughts. Further assessment is warranted to evaluate mood stability, functional impairment, and safety considerations.",

The detailed symptom descriptions, including mood swings, episodic nature, and features of both depression and mania, further support the match. The reasoning provided also emphasizes the episodic pattern characteristic of bipolar disorder.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a complex picture of fluctuating mood, energy, and thoughts that significantly impact your daily life. During depressive episodes, you experience <sym>anhedonia</sym>, persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, social withdrawal, and cognitive issues like forgetfulness and confusion. You also notice physical symptoms such as <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>stress-related pains</sym>, along with sleep disturbances that vary depending on your mood state. In your manic episodes, you describe a <sym>decreased need for sleep</sym>, heightened <sym>energy</sym>, impulsivity, and engaging in risky behaviors. Anxiety symptoms, such as feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and <sym>panic-like sensations</sym>, are also present, especially during mood transitions. Your occasional <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and substance use are important to consider, as they add to the complexity of your presentation. It\u2019s clear you are navigating significant mood swings and associated symptoms that require careful assessment and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current or most recent episode manic, severe with mixed features, moderate severity, with current mild depressive symptoms and anxiety features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of distinct episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>\u2014including <sym>anhedonia</sym>, hopelessness, and social withdrawal\u2014and episodes of <sym>mania</sym> characterized by <sym>decreased sleep</sym>, increased <sym>goal-directed activity</sym>, impulsivity, and elevated energy support a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>mixed features</sym> is suggested by the overlapping symptoms of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>mania</sym> occurring in close succession, and the mood swings appear to be episodic rather than chronic. The patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> further complicate the clinical picture but are common comorbid features. The absence of persistent psychotic symptoms or hallucinations makes <med>schizoaffective disorder</med> less likely. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes, impulsivity, and episodic nature aligns with <med>Bipolar I Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Arrange a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and develop a tailored treatment plan.\n2. Initiate or adjust mood stabilizer medication (e.g., lithium, valproate) to manage mood swings and prevent relapse.\n3. Consider adding or optimizing adjunctive treatments such as psychoeducation, psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy), and treatment for anxiety symptoms.\n4. Monitor closely for suicidal ideation and substance use, providing crisis resources or safety planning as needed.\n5. Educate about the importance of medication adherence, regular sleep routines, and recognizing early signs of mood episodes.\n6. Coordinate care with primary healthcare providers to address somatic symptoms and ensure holistic management.",
