Today, I will be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment is designed to help us understand different aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We will go through 23 questions together, and I'll ask you to respond honestly about how you've been feeling and functioning recently. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared a very complex and distressing set of experiences that encompass a wide range of symptoms affecting your mood, thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a difficult time, feeling overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and agitation. You\u2019ve also described experiencing perceptual disturbances like hearing voices and feeling that your thoughts are being broadcast, which can be very frightening. Your reports of mood fluctuations, impulsivity, and engaging in risky activities, along with thoughts of self-harm, suggest substantial emotional turmoil. It\u2019s important to recognize how challenging these symptoms are and that you\u2019re seeking help, which is a positive step forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes classic features of psychosis such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional beliefs about thought broadcasting and external control</sym>. Concurrently, there are mood symptoms characterized by episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, risk-taking behaviors, and feelings of irritability, suggesting a manic or hypomanic component. The persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate ongoing mood disturbance. The coexistence of psychotic features with mood episodes aligns with a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>, bipolar type. The presence of dissociative symptoms, cognitive difficulties, and substance use complicates the picture but does not exclude this diagnosis. Given the severity, this diagnosis helps explain the wide spectrum of symptoms and guides treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for risk, including a detailed exploration of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate an integrated treatment plan combining antipsychotic medication to address psychotic symptoms and mood stabilizers or mood episode-specific medications to manage bipolar features.  \n3. Provide psychotherapy tailored to mood and psychotic symptoms, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for psychosis and mood regulation.  \n4. Implement safety planning and close monitoring due to risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation.  \n5. Address substance use issues through psychoeducation and integrated substance abuse treatment if appropriate.  \n6. Consider referral for social support services and psychoeducation for the patient and family to promote understanding and adherence to treatment.",

Key symptomatology includes:\n\n- **Depressive symptoms:** Reports of anhedonia, feelings of heaviness, hopelessness, and thoughts of self-harm suggest significant depressive features.\n- **Anxiety and agitation:** Experiences of persistent worry, feeling on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors indicate prominent anxiety symptoms.\n- **Psychotic features:** Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), delusional thoughts regarding thought broadcasting and external control, and dissociative experiences reflect psychotic processes.\n- **Affective instability and hyperactivity:** Reports of increased energy, decreased sleep with restlessness, and engaging in risky activities point toward potential mood dysregulation or manic episodes.\n- **Cognitive and perceptual disturbances:** Memory issues, feelings of detachment (dissociation), and confusion suggest possible cognitive impairment or dissociative phenomena.\n- **Somatic complaints:** Unexplained aches and pains are noted, though their clinical relevance remains uncertain.\n- **Substance use behaviors:** Recent alcohol consumption exceeding four drinks per occasion, tobacco smoking, and self-medication with non-prescribed substances are documented, serving as potential maladaptive coping mechanisms and risk factors.\n\nPattern-wise, there is a notable co-occurrence of mood symptoms with psychotic features and impulsive behaviors, suggestive of a mood disorder with psychotic features or a primary psychotic disorder with mood components. The presence of dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties warrants further assessment for comorbid dissociative or neurocognitive conditions.\n\nClinically significant areas include:\n- Risk for self-harm and suicidal ideation, given expressions of hopelessness and dark thoughts.\n- Psychosis, evidenced by auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs.\n- Mood dysregulation, possibly manic or hypomanic episodes, indicated by increased energy, reduced need for sleep, and risky activities.\n- Anxiety and avoidance behaviors impacting functioning.\n- Substance use as a potential exacerbating factor or maladaptive coping strategy.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include:\n- Suicidal ideation with thoughts of non-wakefulness.\n- Psychotic symptoms (voices, delusions).\n- Substance misuse.\n- Impulsivity and engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a multifaceted presentation with prominent mood disturbance, psychotic features, anxiety symptoms, and substance use. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to delineate diagnostic formulation, assess risk, and develop an integrated treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and distressing set of experiences that encompass a wide range of symptoms affecting your mood, thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through a difficult time, feeling overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and agitation. You\u2019ve also described experiencing perceptual disturbances like hearing voices and feeling that your thoughts are being broadcast, which can be very frightening. Your reports of mood fluctuations, impulsivity, and engaging in risky activities, along with thoughts of self-harm, suggest substantial emotional turmoil. It\u2019s important to recognize how challenging these symptoms are and that you\u2019re seeking help, which is a positive step forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes classic features of psychosis such as <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional beliefs about thought broadcasting and external control</sym>. Concurrently, there are mood symptoms characterized by episodes of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, risk-taking behaviors, and feelings of irritability, suggesting a manic or hypomanic component. The persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> indicate ongoing mood disturbance. The coexistence of psychotic features with mood episodes aligns with a diagnosis of <med>schizoaffective disorder</med>, bipolar type. The presence of dissociative symptoms, cognitive difficulties, and substance use complicates the picture but does not exclude this diagnosis. Given the severity, this diagnosis helps explain the wide spectrum of symptoms and guides treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for risk, including a detailed exploration of mood episodes, psychotic symptoms, and substance use.  \n2. Initiate an integrated treatment plan combining antipsychotic medication to address psychotic symptoms and mood stabilizers or mood episode-specific medications to manage bipolar features.  \n3. Provide psychotherapy tailored to mood and psychotic symptoms, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for psychosis and mood regulation.  \n4. Implement safety planning and close monitoring due to risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation.  \n5. Address substance use issues through psychoeducation and integrated substance abuse treatment if appropriate.  \n6. Consider referral for social support services and psychoeducation for the patient and family to promote understanding and adherence to treatment.",
