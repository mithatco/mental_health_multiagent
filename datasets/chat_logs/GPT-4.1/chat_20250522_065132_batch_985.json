Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to address mood and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Address somatic complaints through medical evaluation to rule out underlying physical health issues and incorporate relaxation or stress management techniques to reduce physiological arousal.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: Clinical Observation Summary:\n\nThe patient presents with prominent affective symptoms characterized by persistent anhedonia, depressed mood, and feelings of hopelessness over the past two weeks, suggestive of a depressive episode. Concurrently, there is evidence of significant anxiety features, including pervasive tension, feelings of being on edge, and avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations. The patient reports irritability, increased energy levels despite sleep disturbance (hypersomnia or reduced sleep with restlessness), and recurrent intrusive thoughts with compulsive rituals, indicating possible obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Somatic complaints such as headaches and muscle tension further support heightened physiological arousal.\n\nThe patient's self-report of occasional passive suicidal thoughts without current intent or planning warrants careful monitoring but does not appear to indicate active suicidal ideation at this time. Dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached or observing oneself externally, are noted but are infrequent.\n\nNotably, the patient reports social withdrawal and emotional blunting, with decreased interest in usual activities and diminished close relationships, indicating possible social and emotional disengagement. Substance use appears minimal or absent, and there are no indications of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a constellation of mood disturbance, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and somatic symptoms, consistent with comorbid mood and anxiety pathology, potentially with obsessive-compulsive features. The absence of psychotic phenomena and substance misuse suggests a primary mood and anxiety disorder spectrum.\n\nClinical significance includes the need for ongoing assessment of suicidal risk, management of mood and anxiety symptoms, and evaluation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The presentation also raises concern for functional impairment related to behavioral and interpersonal withdrawal.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, persistent feelings of hopelessness, and compulsive behaviors that may interfere with functioning. While no active planning or intent is reported, continued monitoring is essential.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation with depressive, anxious, and obsessive-compulsive features, accompanied by somatic complaints and social withdrawal. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and tailored intervention plan are recommended to address these interrelated symptoms.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you have been experiencing a persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you usually enjoy, which has left you feeling disconnected and unmotivated. You mentioned feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> most days, overwhelmed by a sense that things may not improve. You described increased <sym>irritability</sym> and difficulty sleeping, despite feeling restless and having lots of energy during the day. You also noted frequent <sym>anxiety</sym>\u2014feeling <sym>on edge</sym> and tense most of the time, along with avoidance of situations that might trigger your worries. Additionally, you experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and perform <sym>rituals</sym> like handwashing and checking, which are distressing and take up much of your day. You report physical symptoms such as <sym>headaches</sym> and muscle tension, feeling that your concerns are sometimes dismissed by others, and occasional <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym>. Social withdrawal and feelings of emotional disconnection are also present. Overall, your symptoms suggest a complex mix of mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive features, affecting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with Anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> over at least two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, including feelings of <sym>being on edge</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and physical hyperarousal, suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive rituals</sym> indicates <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> features. The physical symptoms of <sym>headaches</sym> and muscle tension, along with concerns about being dismissed, are consistent with somatic manifestations often seen in mood and anxiety disorders but do not meet criteria for <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> since the somatic symptoms are better explained by mood and anxiety. The absence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse points toward a primary mood and anxiety disorder spectrum diagnosis, with obsessive-compulsive features contributing to overall impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including screening for suicidality and severity of symptoms.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), to address mood and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in suicidal thoughts or worsening symptoms, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n5. Address somatic complaints through medical evaluation to rule out underlying physical health issues and incorporate relaxation or stress management techniques to reduce physiological arousal.",
