There is notable anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, suggestive of comorbid depressive features. The patient reports persistent worry, irritability, and somatic complaints (headaches, muscle tension) linked to anxiety states. Sleep disturbances related to rumination about social interactions further exacerbate their emotional distress. \n\nResponse patterns indicate chronic social apprehension, emotional withdrawal, and difficulty experiencing pleasure, with no evidence of psychotic symptoms or substance misuse. The absence of self-harm ideation, suicidal thoughts, or hallucinations suggests a lower immediate risk but warrants ongoing monitoring given the severity of social anxiety and depressive symptoms. The patient demonstrates insight into their emotional state, with no current indications of mania, psychosis, or substance abuse.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include social anxiety disorder, comorbid depression, and somatic symptoms related to anxiety. Risk factors involve social avoidance, feelings of loneliness, and associated functional impairment. No immediate safety concerns are evident, but the patient's social isolation and emotional distress necessitate targeted interventions to address anxiety, improve social functioning, and support mood stabilization.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you often feel <sym>little interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy, and this sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym> affects your outlook on life. You experience frequent <sym>anxiety</sym> about social situations, which leads you to <sym>avoid</sym> gatherings and social interactions, contributing to feelings of <sym>loneliness</sym> and <sym>isolation</sym>. You notice <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle tension related to your anxious states, and you report <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> caused by ruminating thoughts about social situations. Despite these challenges, you do not currently have thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or <sym>psychosis</sym>, and you seem aware of your emotional struggles, which is a positive sign. Your experiences of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and difficulty engaging in social activities highlight significant emotional and functional difficulties that warrant clinical attention. \n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</med> with features of depressive symptoms\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's primary issues include persistent <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, intense <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> (e.g., worry before social events), and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and muscle tension associated with anxiety. The <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and distress in social settings are central features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>anhedonia</sym> and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest comorbid <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The absence of psychotic symptoms, substance misuse, or suicidal ideation indicates that the primary diagnosis involves social anxiety with secondary mood features rather than a primary mood or psychotic disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) specifically targeting social anxiety and maladaptive thought patterns.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), if symptoms are significantly impairing functioning.  \n3. Encourage development of coping strategies for managing <sym>anticipatory anxiety</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.  \n4. Explore social skills training or exposure therapy to gradually reduce avoidance behaviors.  \n5. Regular follow-up to monitor mood, anxiety levels, and functional improvements, and to adjust treatment as needed.",
