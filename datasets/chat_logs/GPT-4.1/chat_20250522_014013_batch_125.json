Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire that helps us understand different areas of your mental health over the past two weeks. It's a helpful tool to identify if there are specific concerns we should explore further. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you. The assessment will involve 23 questions covering various domains like mood, anxiety, substance use, and others. I will ask each question one at a time, and I'd appreciate your honest and open responses. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym/hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you. Your <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like memory problems, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about past mistakes indicate significant emotional and psychological distress. You also mentioned engaging in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope, which adds complexity to your situation. Your feelings of being misunderstood and your recent <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlight the importance of addressing safety concerns alongside your emotional struggles. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and seeking help is a positive step toward understanding and managing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with Anxiety Features and Substance Use</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down most days</quote>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and intrusive thoughts further support a mood disorder diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>\u2014including feeling tense, avoiding social situations, and experiencing panic-like episodes\u2014indicates comorbid anxiety. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected and outside of oneself, suggest possible dissociative features often seen in trauma-related conditions but may also be part of the mood and anxiety spectrum. The <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use \u2014 including alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription misuse \u2014 highlight risk factors needing attention. While somatic complaints are present, they are likely manifestations of underlying psychological distress rather than a primary somatic disorder. The overall symptom profile points toward a complex mood and anxiety presentation with substance involvement, requiring comprehensive assessment and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to clarify the duration, severity, and impact of symptoms, and assess for any risk of self-harm or suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> thoughts and evaluate the need for immediate intervention if risks escalate.\n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, possibly involving a psychiatrist.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and consider referral to specialized addiction services.\n6. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor progress, medication side effects, and safety concerns.\n7. Explore additional support for social connection and coping skills to reduce feelings of isolation and enhance emotional resilience.",

There is evidence of sleep disturbance characterized by reduced sleep duration with maintained or increased energy levels, alongside cognitive complaints such as memory impairment and disorientation. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of heightened tension, social avoidance, and panic-like episodes in crowded settings. Dissociative experiences, including depersonalization and derealization, are reported, alongside feelings of emotional detachment and social withdrawal. Intrusive, ruminative thoughts about past mistakes are evident, with some compulsive thinking tendencies. The patient\u2019s self-reported thoughts of self-harm, albeit without current ideation of intent, constitute a significant risk factor. Substance use behaviors include regular cigarette smoking, episodic alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels, and misuse of prescription medications to cope with distress, further complicating the clinical picture. Somatic complaints such as headaches, muscle aches, and unspecified pains may be somatic manifestations of underlying psychological distress. The patient also reports feelings of being misunderstood and invalidated by others, indicating potential difficulties with interpersonal validation.\n\nPatterns observed include co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, alongside substance misuse and risk for self-harm. These features suggest a complex presentation requiring comprehensive assessment to delineate underlying mood, anxiety, and trauma-related pathology. The presence of substance use and recent suicidal thoughts warrants careful risk assessment and safety planning. Overall, the symptom profile indicates moderate to severe emotional dysregulation with significant functional impairment and potential underlying comorbidities.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing picture of your mental health. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym/hopelessness</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym> such as feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you. Your <sym>sleep difficulties</sym>, <sym>cognitive issues</sym> like memory problems, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about past mistakes indicate significant emotional and psychological distress. You also mentioned engaging in <sym>substance use</sym> as a way to cope, which adds complexity to your situation. Your feelings of being misunderstood and your recent <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> highlight the importance of addressing safety concerns alongside your emotional struggles. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed, and seeking help is a positive step toward understanding and managing what you\u2019re going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with Anxiety Features and Substance Use</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <quote>feeling pretty down most days</quote>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and intrusive thoughts further support a mood disorder diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>\u2014including feeling tense, avoiding social situations, and experiencing panic-like episodes\u2014indicates comorbid anxiety. The dissociative experiences, such as feeling disconnected and outside of oneself, suggest possible dissociative features often seen in trauma-related conditions but may also be part of the mood and anxiety spectrum. The <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and substance use \u2014 including alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription misuse \u2014 highlight risk factors needing attention. While somatic complaints are present, they are likely manifestations of underlying psychological distress rather than a primary somatic disorder. The overall symptom profile points toward a complex mood and anxiety presentation with substance involvement, requiring comprehensive assessment and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a detailed clinical interview to clarify the duration, severity, and impact of symptoms, and assess for any risk of self-harm or suicidality.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>self-harm</sym> thoughts and evaluate the need for immediate intervention if risks escalate.\n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy targeting <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms, possibly involving a psychiatrist.\n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or trauma-informed therapy, to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n5. Address substance use through motivational interviewing and consider referral to specialized addiction services.\n6. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor progress, medication side effects, and safety concerns.\n7. Explore additional support for social connection and coping skills to reduce feelings of isolation and enhance emotional resilience.",
