Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us identify various areas of your mental health that might be affecting you, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and other symptoms. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment consists of 23 questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond with whatever best describes your experience. Are you ready to begin?"

      "content": "You have shared a very difficult and distressing experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot right now. You\u2019re dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which seem to be compounded by ongoing anxiety, hyperarousal, and intrusive memories related to the recent trauma. Your sleep has been severely disrupted, with nightmares and frequent awakenings, and you\u2019ve described feeling detached or dissociated at times. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which is very serious, and you\u2019re using substances like alcohol and cigarettes to cope. It sounds like the trauma and loss from the accident are significantly impacting your mental health and daily functioning, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (unspecified, due to ongoing use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including re-experiencing symptoms such as flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, persistent hyperarousal (feeling on edge, hypervigilance, sleep disturbance), and dissociative experiences. The avoidance behaviors, emotional numbing, and intrusive thoughts further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the pervasive low mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing substance use, including alcohol and marijuana, appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy that may complicate the clinical picture and pose additional risks. The presence of physical symptoms like headaches and muscle tension could be related to both trauma-related hyperarousal and somatic manifestations of depression. Given the severity of symptoms and risk factors, an integrated approach addressing trauma, mood, and substance use is indicated.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment and ensure the patient's safety, including developing a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. **Referral to a mental health specialist:** Consider referral to a trauma-informed psychiatrist or psychologist with experience in PTSD and co-occurring disorders for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning.  \n3. **Evidence-based trauma treatment:** Initiate trauma-focused therapies such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).  \n4. **Address comorbid depression:** Incorporate psychotherapy aimed at mood symptoms, possibly including antidepressant medication if clinically indicated.  \n5. **Substance use intervention:** Engage in substance use counseling or detoxification programs as needed, and develop strategies to reduce reliance on alcohol and other substances.  \n6. **Supportive care:** Encourage engagement in supportive therapy, peer support groups, and activities that promote safety and stability.  \n7. **Monitor and manage sleep issues:** Use behavioral strategies for sleep hygiene and consider pharmacologic options if appropriate, under medical supervision.",

There is evidence of heightened anxiety and hyperarousal, characterized by persistent feelings of being on edge, irritability, sleep disturbances (initial and fragmented sleep with nightmares), and physiological symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension. Intrusive trauma-related symptoms are prominent, notably flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, avoidance behaviors (avoiding driving and trauma-related stimuli), and perceptual disturbances including auditory phenomena. Dissociative experiences are reported, with sensations of detachment and depersonalization. Cognitive concerns include recent memory lapses and disorientation in familiar environments.\n\nThe patient reports active self-harm ideation, with passive thoughts of disappearance, indicating elevated suicidal risk. Substance use is notable, involving daily smoking, increased alcohol intake, and non-prescribed use of sleep aids and marijuana, which may exacerbate mental health difficulties and pose additional risks.\n\nPatterns in responses reveal a trauma-related symptom cluster alongside mood disorder features, with marked avoidance, emotional dysregulation, and somatic complaints. The presentation suggests comorbidities that may include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive disorder, and substance use disorder.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation, substance misuse, sleep impairment, and dissociative episodes, all of which warrant immediate clinical attention to ensure safety and formulate an integrated treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very difficult and distressing experience, and it\u2019s clear that you are going through a lot right now. You\u2019re dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, which seem to be compounded by ongoing anxiety, hyperarousal, and intrusive memories related to the recent trauma. Your sleep has been severely disrupted, with nightmares and frequent awakenings, and you\u2019ve described feeling detached or dissociated at times. Additionally, you\u2019ve expressed thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym>, which is very serious, and you\u2019re using substances like alcohol and cigarettes to cope. It sounds like the trauma and loss from the accident are significantly impacting your mental health and daily functioning, and I want to acknowledge how tough this must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> with features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> (unspecified, due to ongoing use of alcohol, cigarettes, and non-prescribed medications).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including re-experiencing symptoms such as flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, persistent hyperarousal (feeling on edge, hypervigilance, sleep disturbance), and dissociative experiences. The avoidance behaviors, emotional numbing, and intrusive thoughts further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the pervasive low mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and passive suicidal thoughts suggest comorbid <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing substance use, including alcohol and marijuana, appears to be a maladaptive coping strategy that may complicate the clinical picture and pose additional risks. The presence of physical symptoms like headaches and muscle tension could be related to both trauma-related hyperarousal and somatic manifestations of depression. Given the severity of symptoms and risk factors, an integrated approach addressing trauma, mood, and substance use is indicated.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. **Immediate Safety Assessment:** Conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment and ensure the patient's safety, including developing a safety plan if necessary.  \n2. **Referral to a mental health specialist:** Consider referral to a trauma-informed psychiatrist or psychologist with experience in PTSD and co-occurring disorders for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning.  \n3. **Evidence-based trauma treatment:** Initiate trauma-focused therapies such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).  \n4. **Address comorbid depression:** Incorporate psychotherapy aimed at mood symptoms, possibly including antidepressant medication if clinically indicated.  \n5. **Substance use intervention:** Engage in substance use counseling or detoxification programs as needed, and develop strategies to reduce reliance on alcohol and other substances.  \n6. **Supportive care:** Encourage engagement in supportive therapy, peer support groups, and activities that promote safety and stability.  \n7. **Monitor and manage sleep issues:** Use behavioral strategies for sleep hygiene and consider pharmacologic options if appropriate, under medical supervision.",
