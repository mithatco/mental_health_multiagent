There's no right or wrong answer\u2014just tell me how you've been experiencing things. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a complex and distressing range of experiences that reflect significant emotional and psychological challenges. You\u2019ve described persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling as though a <sym>weight on your chest</sym> and hopelessness are constant, which can be incredibly exhausting. Your irritability and social avoidance suggest social anxiety and interpersonal difficulties, while your sleep disturbances, including waking frequently and difficulty falling back asleep, further contribute to fatigue. You also mentioned episodes of <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> such as rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath, which indicate episodic intense anxiety. Additionally, you experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> about past embarrassments, and sometimes feel detached or outside of yourself, which might point to dissociative experiences. Your acknowledgment of feeling lost about your identity or goals, combined with social disconnection, indicates a profound impact on your sense of self and relationships. Importantly, while you have had <sym>passive thoughts of disappearing</sym>, you do not have current active plans or intentions to harm yourself, but it is a signal to monitor closely. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant mood and anxiety disorder that is affecting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> (provisional). Dissociative features may also be present.\n\n**Reasoning:** The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of hopelessness align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance, cognitive complaints, and intrusive negative thoughts further support this diagnosis. The reports of <sym>social anxiety</sym> and avoidance, along with physical symptoms of panic (heart racing, shortness of breath), suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible episodic <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The dissociative feelings, such as feeling outside of oneself, may be related to dissociative features often seen in severe anxiety or trauma-related responses, but further assessment is needed to clarify this. The absence of psychotic symptoms and lack of substance misuse reduce the likelihood of other diagnoses such as schizophrenia or substance-induced disorders. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts indicates a need for careful monitoring and intervention to ensure safety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and consider standardized assessments to clarify diagnoses and severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan and monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts, providing immediate support if needed.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, after a thorough psychiatric evaluation.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene strategies and evaluate for potential sleep disorders.  \n6. Explore trauma history or dissociative symptoms more deeply if they persist, possibly involving trauma-focused interventions.  \n7. Encourage social engagement at a comfortable pace to reduce avoidance and increase social support.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with prominent symptoms indicative of depressive and anxious features, including persistent anhedonia (\"little interest or pleasure\"), feelings of hopelessness, and pervasive low mood. There are reports of irritability and irritability-related interpersonal difficulties. The patient's sleep disturbance is characterized by difficulty maintaining sleep, contributing to fatigue. Anxiety manifests as social apprehension (\"feeling nervous, anxious, on edge\") and episodic panic symptoms (heart racing, shortness of breath, fear of losing control). The patient also reports avoidance behaviors concerning social situations, aligning with social anxiety symptoms.\n\nCognitive concerns are evident through reported memory lapses and difficulty with concentration. The presence of intrusive, repetitive negative thoughts about past embarrassments suggests ruminative tendencies. The experience of dissociative-like symptoms (\"feeling outside of myself\") and feelings of emotional detachment (\"feeling disconnected from oneself or surroundings\") may indicate dissociative features or emotional numbing.\n\nThere are no indications of psychotic symptoms\u2014no hallucinations or delusional experiences\u2014and substance use appears minimal and within prescribed limits. Risk factors include passive suicidal ideation (\"thoughts of disappearing\") without active intent or planning, which warrants careful monitoring.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Considerations:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, particularly social anxiety and panic features.\n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive complaints suggest possible neurovegetative and attentional impacts.\n- Intrusive negative thoughts and dissociative experiences point toward ruminative and dissociative processes.\n- Social withdrawal and emotional detachment may contribute to or exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive disorder, given persistent low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and sleep disturbance.\n- Generalized or social anxiety disorder, considering pervasive anxiety, social avoidance, and social discomfort.\n- Panic symptoms merit further assessment to determine if panic disorder is present.\n- Dissociative symptoms and emotional numbing may suggest comorbid dissociative features or trauma-related processes.\n- Passive suicidal ideation necessitates safety planning and close monitoring.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Passive suicidal thoughts, though no active ideation or intent reported.\n- Significant functional impairment related to mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.\n- Avoidance behaviors that may lead to social isolation.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized primarily by depressive and anxiety symptoms with associated cognitive and dissociative features. The symptom profile warrants a comprehensive diagnostic assessment to delineate mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses, evaluate for trauma-related or dissociative conditions, and develop an appropriate treatment plan emphasizing safety, symptom management, and functional improvement.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing range of experiences that reflect significant emotional and psychological challenges. You\u2019ve described persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feeling as though a <sym>weight on your chest</sym> and hopelessness are constant, which can be incredibly exhausting. Your irritability and social avoidance suggest social anxiety and interpersonal difficulties, while your sleep disturbances, including waking frequently and difficulty falling back asleep, further contribute to fatigue. You also mentioned episodes of <sym>panic-like sensations</sym> such as rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath, which indicate episodic intense anxiety. Additionally, you experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> about past embarrassments, and sometimes feel detached or outside of yourself, which might point to dissociative experiences. Your acknowledgment of feeling lost about your identity or goals, combined with social disconnection, indicates a profound impact on your sense of self and relationships. Importantly, while you have had <sym>passive thoughts of disappearing</sym>, you do not have current active plans or intentions to harm yourself, but it is a signal to monitor closely. Overall, your symptoms suggest a significant mood and anxiety disorder that is affecting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med> with features of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med> (provisional). Dissociative features may also be present.\n\n**Reasoning:** The persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of hopelessness align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbance, cognitive complaints, and intrusive negative thoughts further support this diagnosis. The reports of <sym>social anxiety</sym> and avoidance, along with physical symptoms of panic (heart racing, shortness of breath), suggest comorbid <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible episodic <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The dissociative feelings, such as feeling outside of oneself, may be related to dissociative features often seen in severe anxiety or trauma-related responses, but further assessment is needed to clarify this. The absence of psychotic symptoms and lack of substance misuse reduce the likelihood of other diagnoses such as schizophrenia or substance-induced disorders. The presence of passive suicidal thoughts indicates a need for careful monitoring and intervention to ensure safety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview and consider standardized assessments to clarify diagnoses and severity.  \n2. Develop a safety plan and monitor for any escalation of suicidal thoughts, providing immediate support if needed.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, after a thorough psychiatric evaluation.  \n5. Address sleep disturbances with sleep hygiene strategies and evaluate for potential sleep disorders.  \n6. Explore trauma history or dissociative symptoms more deeply if they persist, possibly involving trauma-focused interventions.  \n7. Encourage social engagement at a comfortable pace to reduce avoidance and increase social support.",
