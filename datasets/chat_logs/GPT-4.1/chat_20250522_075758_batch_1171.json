We will go through 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, and others. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly.

You feel <sym>persistent sadness, hopelessness</sym>, and a <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. You've also been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that include physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and difficulty breathing. Sleep has been disrupted, with frequent awakenings, and you\u2019ve noticed <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and a sense of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You sometimes feel <sym>lost about your identity and goals</sym>, and you\u2019ve been withdrawing from others, feeling <sym>isolated</sym>. You also report <sym>physical pains</sym> such as headaches and stomach aches, despite doctors reassuring you there is no medical cause. Importantly, you experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. You have not used substances recently, and you do not hear voices or have paranoid thoughts. Your symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a two-week history of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. These core symptoms, along with sleep disturbance, cognitive issues, and physical complaints, support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry, feeling on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance of specific situations</sym>, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The experiences of <sym>dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization</sym> suggest the presence of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can occur secondary to severe stress or mood disturbances. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant careful monitoring. No evidence of psychotic symptoms, substance use, or delusional beliefs was noted, and physical health concerns appear to be medically benign at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk of harm, and explore underlying factors.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other appropriate psychotherapy to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, tailored to the patient's symptom profile and preferences, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety planning is in place.  \n5. Address sleep disturbance through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and healthy coping strategies.  \n7. Follow up regularly to evaluate treatment response and adjust the plan as needed.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: The patient reports significant mood disturbances characterized by anhedonia and pervasive feelings of sadness and hopelessness over the past two weeks. They also endorse increased irritability and irritability-related frustration. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including persistent feelings of being on edge, worry about potential adverse events, and episodes of panic with associated physical sensations such as shortness of breath and tachycardia. The patient demonstrates avoidance behaviors related to anxiety-provoking situations, notably crowded places and public transportation.\n\nSleep disturbance is evident, with difficulty maintaining restful sleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Cognitive concerns include recent forgetfulness and disorientation, suggesting potential cognitive impairment or stress-related cognitive effects. Intrusive, negative ruminative thoughts about worst-case scenarios are reported, alongside passive suicidal ideation without indications of intent or planning.\n\nPhysical symptoms include unexplained headaches and gastrointestinal discomfort, despite medical reassurance of absence of physical pathology. The patient also describes feelings of dissociation, including depersonalization and derealization, particularly when overwhelmed. Social withdrawal and decreased emotional connectedness with others indicate possible social isolation.\n\nNo current substance use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs is reported. The patient denies hallucinations, paranoid ideation, compulsive behaviors, or delusional thinking.\n\n**Potential areas of clinical significance include:**  \n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia, hopelessness, and cognitive disturbances  \n- Anxiety disorder features, including panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance  \n- Dissociative symptoms suggestive of dissociative experiences or trauma-related responses  \n- Passive suicidal ideation requiring ongoing monitoring and safety assessment  \n- Physical complaints without medical cause, possibly linked to psychological distress\n\n**Risk factors and warning signs:**  \n- Passive suicidal thoughts, though without active intent or plan  \n- Chronic anxiety and dissociative experiences that may impair functioning  \n- Sleep disturbance and cognitive complaints that could exacerbate mood and anxiety symptoms\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a constellation of depressive, anxious, dissociative, and somatic symptoms consistent with a significant mood and anxiety disorder presentation. Further assessment is warranted to evaluate risk, explore underlying factors, and determine appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that over the past two weeks, you have been experiencing a range of difficult feelings and physical sensations. You feel <sym>persistent sadness, hopelessness</sym>, and a <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities that once brought you joy. You've also been feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym>, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> that include physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and difficulty breathing. Sleep has been disrupted, with frequent awakenings, and you\u2019ve noticed <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and a sense of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. You sometimes feel <sym>lost about your identity and goals</sym>, and you\u2019ve been withdrawing from others, feeling <sym>isolated</sym>. You also report <sym>physical pains</sym> such as headaches and stomach aches, despite doctors reassuring you there is no medical cause. Importantly, you experience <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>. You have not used substances recently, and you do not hear voices or have paranoid thoughts. Your symptoms seem to be significantly impacting your daily functioning and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxious Features> and <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports a two-week history of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. These core symptoms, along with sleep disturbance, cognitive issues, and physical complaints, support a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The prominent anxiety symptoms, including <sym>worry, feeling on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance of specific situations</sym>, indicate comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The experiences of <sym>dissociation, depersonalization, and derealization</sym> suggest the presence of <med>Dissociative Symptoms</med>, which can occur secondary to severe stress or mood disturbances. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant careful monitoring. No evidence of psychotic symptoms, substance use, or delusional beliefs was noted, and physical health concerns appear to be medically benign at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess risk of harm, and explore underlying factors.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other appropriate psychotherapy to address depression, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, tailored to the patient's symptom profile and preferences, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety planning is in place.  \n5. Address sleep disturbance through behavioral strategies and, if necessary, medication.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about mood and anxiety symptoms, dissociation, and healthy coping strategies.  \n7. Follow up regularly to evaluate treatment response and adjust the plan as needed.",
