Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to get a broad sense of your mental health over the past two weeks. Everything you share will be kept confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space where you can honestly talk about your experiences. The assessment involves 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You describe persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless and detached</quote>, which has significantly impacted your interest in activities and your outlook on life. Additionally, you report episodes of <sym>panic</sym> with physical symptoms like racing heart, as well as pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>feeling on edge</sym>. Psychotic symptoms are also present, including <quote>hearing voices</quote> and <quote>believing that thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read your mind</quote>, accompanied by dissociative sensations like <quote>feeling outside of yourself</quote> and memory issues. You mention feeling <quote>withdrawn from others</quote> and experiencing <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about ending your life, though you do not have current plans. There are also physical complaints such as headaches and back pain, alongside some misuse of medication. Your experiences indicate a complex interplay of mood, psychotic, anxiety, dissociative, and somatic symptoms, which are causing significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> with <med>comorbid major depressive disorder</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med> (including panic attacks and generalized anxiety features), along with dissociative features and passive suicidal ideation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> such as thoughts being broadcasted or influenced by external forces strongly suggest <med>psychotic symptoms</med> consistent with <med>schizophrenia</med>. The symptoms have persisted for more than two weeks and involve disorganized perceptions and beliefs. The concurrent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggest a <med>comorbid major depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, the report of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>feeling anxious and on edge</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate significant <med>anxiety</med> features. The dissociative experiences, such as <quote>feeling outside of oneself</quote> and <quote>disconnection from reality</quote>, further support a diagnosis involving dissociative phenomena. Given the severity and variety of symptoms, this appears to be a complex presentation requiring thorough management. It is important to consider the risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>, <med>mood state</med>, <med>anxiety levels</med>, and <med>risk assessment</med> for suicidality.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for escalation of <sym>self-harm</sym> risk.\n3. Consider starting <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to address <med>psychotic symptoms</med> and evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications based on further assessment.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, emphasizing the importance of adherence to treatment and safety.\n5. Arrange for psychotherapy, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) tailored for psychosis and depression, and incorporate trauma-informed approaches if relevant.\n6. Facilitate coordination with other healthcare providers, including medical evaluation for physical symptoms and medication management.\n7. Establish regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication effects, and safety, adjusting treatment as necessary.",

They also endorse notable mood disturbances characterized by depressive features and episodic panic attacks, alongside persistent anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms such as feeling on edge and avoiding situations that provoke anxiety. Psychotic phenomena are indicated by auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and delusional experiences (belief that thoughts are broadcasted or influenced by external forces), suggestive of psychotic symptoms. The patient exhibits dissociative symptoms, including feelings of depersonalization and derealization, as well as cognitive disturbances such as memory impairment and difficulty with orientation.\n\nThe patient demonstrates insight into some maladaptive behaviors, including impulsivity and the use of medication beyond prescribed limits, which may indicate impulsivity or poor self-regulation. There is also evidence of passive suicidal ideation without current intent or plans, alongside reports of physical symptoms like headaches, back pain, and tension, which could be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurring mood disturbance with psychotic features (auditory hallucinations, delusional beliefs)\n- Elevated anxiety levels with avoidance behaviors\n- Dissociative symptoms suggestive of depersonalization/derealization\n- Cognitive impairments, including memory issues\n- Risk factors for suicidality, given reported dark thoughts and passive suicidal ideation\n- Substance use (cigarette smoking) present but not excessive; recreational or self-medicating behaviors noted\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Current suicidal thoughts, although without intent or plan\n- Auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions\n- Dissociative episodes and cognitive disorganization\n- Potential for escalation of psychotic symptoms or mood instability\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient presents with a complex psychiatric profile marked by severe depressive symptoms, psychotic features, anxiety, dissociation, and recent suicidal ideation. The symptomatology suggests a possible primary psychotic disorder with mood components or a comorbid mood disorder with psychotic features. Immediate safety assessment and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation are recommended to determine appropriate interventions and to address potential risk factors.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences over the past two weeks. You describe persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym> such as <quote>feeling hopeless and detached</quote>, which has significantly impacted your interest in activities and your outlook on life. Additionally, you report episodes of <sym>panic</sym> with physical symptoms like racing heart, as well as pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>feeling on edge</sym>. Psychotic symptoms are also present, including <quote>hearing voices</quote> and <quote>believing that thoughts are broadcasted or that others can read your mind</quote>, accompanied by dissociative sensations like <quote>feeling outside of yourself</quote> and memory issues. You mention feeling <quote>withdrawn from others</quote> and experiencing <sym>dark thoughts</sym> about ending your life, though you do not have current plans. There are also physical complaints such as headaches and back pain, alongside some misuse of medication. Your experiences indicate a complex interplay of mood, psychotic, anxiety, dissociative, and somatic symptoms, which are causing significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> with <med>comorbid major depressive disorder</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med> (including panic attacks and generalized anxiety features), along with dissociative features and passive suicidal ideation.\n\n**Reasoning:** The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> and <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> such as thoughts being broadcasted or influenced by external forces strongly suggest <med>psychotic symptoms</med> consistent with <med>schizophrenia</med>. The symptoms have persisted for more than two weeks and involve disorganized perceptions and beliefs. The concurrent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggest a <med>comorbid major depressive disorder</med>. Additionally, the report of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>feeling anxious and on edge</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> indicate significant <med>anxiety</med> features. The dissociative experiences, such as <quote>feeling outside of oneself</quote> and <quote>disconnection from reality</quote>, further support a diagnosis involving dissociative phenomena. Given the severity and variety of symptoms, this appears to be a complex presentation requiring thorough management. It is important to consider the risk of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and safety concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including assessment of <med>psychotic symptoms</med>, <med>mood state</med>, <med>anxiety levels</med>, and <med>risk assessment</med> for suicidality.\n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> and monitor for escalation of <sym>self-harm</sym> risk.\n3. Consider starting <med>antipsychotic medication</med> to address <med>psychotic symptoms</med> and evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant</med> and <med>anxiolytic</med> medications based on further assessment.\n4. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms, emphasizing the importance of adherence to treatment and safety.\n5. Arrange for psychotherapy, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) tailored for psychosis and depression, and incorporate trauma-informed approaches if relevant.\n6. Facilitate coordination with other healthcare providers, including medical evaluation for physical symptoms and medication management.\n7. Establish regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression, medication effects, and safety, adjusting treatment as necessary.",
