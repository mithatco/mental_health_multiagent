You\u2019ve been feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a persistent sense that things may not improve. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>more anxious</sym> than usual, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and avoidance of situations that increase your anxiety. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently, are affecting you, along with cognitive concerns like forgetfulness and disorientation. You mentioned engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and starting many projects, which could be expressions of increased energy or impulsivity. Substance use, including heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, and misuse of medications, has been increased, functioning as a way to cope with stress and emotional pain. Importantly, you\u2019ve had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is a serious concern requiring immediate attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex presentation of mood, anxiety, and substance use issues, with some dissociative experiences and social withdrawal, which suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>irritability</sym>, sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>distant or dissociated</sym> also suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>. The increased engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym> (heavy drinking, smoking, misuse of medications), and attempts to cope with distress indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The combination of mood, anxiety, and substance use symptoms, along with the reported suicidal thoughts, warrants a diagnosis of a complex mood disorder with comorbid conditions requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses, including screening for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> given episodes of increased energy and risky behaviors.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, including immediate risk management and crisis resources.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapies such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> to address depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, and substance use.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or other medications, under psychiatric supervision, especially given the severity and complexity of symptoms.  \n5. Refer for medical evaluation of physical symptoms (headaches, muscle pains, cognitive issues) to rule out underlying medical conditions.  \n6. Implement substance use treatment, including counseling or detoxification programs, to reduce reliance on alcohol, tobacco, and medications.  \n7. Arrange for ongoing monitoring and support to address mood stability, reduce risk of self-harm, and improve social functioning.",

Sleep disturbances characterized by reduced sleep duration and fragmentation are evident, alongside cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness and disorientation. The patient endorses recurrent intrusive negative thoughts and experiences feelings of emotional detachment, social withdrawal, and an ongoing sense of identity confusion. \n\nNotably, the patient exhibits symptoms indicative of mood dysregulation, including episodes of increased energy, risky behaviors, and heightened activity levels over the past two weeks. Anxiety-related symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors targeting social and crowded settings. Somatic complaints, including headaches and muscle pains, are present but attributed by the patient to stress.\n\nSubstance use appears significant, with recent heavy alcohol consumption, increased smoking, and misuse of prescription medications without medical oversight, serving as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient admits to having suicidal thoughts, which pose a notable clinical concern.\n\nPatterns of symptomatology suggest comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, with evidence of impulsivity, substance misuse, and risk factors for self-harm. The presence of dissociative experiences and social withdrawal further complicates the clinical picture.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, possible bipolar features (notably episodes of increased energy and risky behaviors), and substance use disorder. The endorsement of suicidal ideation warrants urgent attention.\n\nOverall, the patient's presentation reflects a complex, multi-dimensional psychopathology with significant functional impairment and elevated risk factors that necessitate comprehensive evaluation and targeted intervention.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you are experiencing a wide range of difficult feelings and behaviors. You\u2019ve been feeling <sym>depressed</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym>, with a persistent sense that things may not improve. You also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>more anxious</sym> than usual, with episodes of <sym>panic</sym> and avoidance of situations that increase your anxiety. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and waking up frequently, are affecting you, along with cognitive concerns like forgetfulness and disorientation. You mentioned engaging in <sym>risky behaviors</sym> and starting many projects, which could be expressions of increased energy or impulsivity. Substance use, including heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, and misuse of medications, has been increased, functioning as a way to cope with stress and emotional pain. Importantly, you\u2019ve had <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which is a serious concern requiring immediate attention. Overall, your symptoms reflect a complex presentation of mood, anxiety, and substance use issues, with some dissociative experiences and social withdrawal, which suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and intervention.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder (likely Major Depressive Disorder) with features of Anxiety Disorder and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks meet criteria for a <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>irritability</sym>, sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> support this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and feelings of being <sym>distant or dissociated</sym> also suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>. The increased engagement in <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, <sym>substance use</sym> (heavy drinking, smoking, misuse of medications), and attempts to cope with distress indicate a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. The combination of mood, anxiety, and substance use symptoms, along with the reported suicidal thoughts, warrants a diagnosis of a complex mood disorder with comorbid conditions requiring integrated treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment to confirm diagnoses, including screening for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> given episodes of increased energy and risky behaviors.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym>, including immediate risk management and crisis resources.  \n3. Initiate evidence-based psychotherapies such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> to address depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, and substance use.  \n4. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants or other medications, under psychiatric supervision, especially given the severity and complexity of symptoms.  \n5. Refer for medical evaluation of physical symptoms (headaches, muscle pains, cognitive issues) to rule out underlying medical conditions.  \n6. Implement substance use treatment, including counseling or detoxification programs, to reduce reliance on alcohol, tobacco, and medications.  \n7. Arrange for ongoing monitoring and support to address mood stability, reduce risk of self-harm, and improve social functioning.",
