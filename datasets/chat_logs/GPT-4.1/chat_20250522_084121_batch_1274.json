This questionnaire helps us understand various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks, including mood, anxiety, substance use, and more. Your responses are confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to share your experiences honestly. We'll go through a series of 23 questions, one at a time, and I'll ask you to describe your feelings and behaviors in your own words. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019re dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities that once brought you joy. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you tired despite sleeping less, and you\u2019re experiencing difficulty with concentration and memory. Anxiety seems to be a significant part of your daily life, with worries about the future, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations that trigger your anxiety. You\u2019ve also mentioned feeling detached at times, questioning your identity, and experiencing strained relationships. Your substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications, appears to be a way you\u2019re coping with these overwhelming feelings. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> heightens concern about your safety and well-being. Overall, your symptoms reflect a challenging mental health situation that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe with Anxious Features</med> accompanied by <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Nicotine, Prescription Medications)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, irritability, and feelings of emotional numbness further support this diagnosis. The presence of excessive worry, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms of anxiety suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of self-harm thoughts, substance misuse, and self-injurious behaviors raise clinical concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> and potential increased risk for harm, requiring safety assessment. The dissociative experiences and identity questions might indicate additional features that could be explored further but are not sufficient alone for a separate diagnosis at this point. The overall presentation is consistent with a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and substance use issues, all of which are affecting functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate risk of self-harm or suicide and establish immediate safety plans if needed.  \n2. Refer to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan, including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and medication management.  \n3. Address substance use by connecting with a substance use counselor or addiction specialist to develop a plan for reduction or cessation and to prevent relapse.  \n4. Implement psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and healthy lifestyle changes such as sleep hygiene and stress management.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety, adjusting interventions as needed.",

There are additionally notable signs of irritability (Q4), sleep disturbance characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep (Q5, Q15), and concentration or memory impairments (Q16). The patient reports feelings of emotional numbness or detachment (Q19), as well as feelings of identity confusion or existential distress (Q20).\n\nAnxiety symptoms are significant, with reports of generalized anxiety, worry about future events (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors related to social and environmental triggers (Q9). These features suggest comorbid anxiety pathology.\n\nThe patient endorses suicidal ideation without intent or plan (Q12), along with self-injurious thoughts, which warrants close risk assessment. Substance use behaviors are notable, including regular cigarette smoking (Q23), alcohol consumption exceeding moderate levels (Q22), and misuse of prescription medications (Q24), all of which may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms.\n\nSomatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and muscle tension (Q10), along with reports of intrusive thoughts related to past mistakes (Q17), further underscore the complexity of the clinical presentation.\n\nPotential areas of clinical significance include major depressive disorder with anxious features, risk of self-harm or suicidality, substance use disorder, and possible dissociative or psychotic-like experiences, although hallucinations or delusions were not reported.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and self-injurious thoughts, necessitating immediate safety evaluation and comprehensive treatment planning. The patient's functional impairment is evident through social withdrawal and diminished interest in activities.\n\nOverall, the assessment suggests a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety, substance misuse, and dissociative features, requiring integrated intervention and safety monitoring.",

      "expected": "substance_abuse",
      "predicted": "You have shared a complex and distressing array of experiences that suggest you are going through a very difficult time. You\u2019re dealing with persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in activities that once brought you joy. Your sleep has been disrupted, leaving you tired despite sleeping less, and you\u2019re experiencing difficulty with concentration and memory. Anxiety seems to be a significant part of your daily life, with worries about the future, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance of certain situations that trigger your anxiety. You\u2019ve also mentioned feeling detached at times, questioning your identity, and experiencing strained relationships. Your substance use, including alcohol, cigarettes, and unprescribed medications, appears to be a way you\u2019re coping with these overwhelming feelings. The presence of <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> heightens concern about your safety and well-being. Overall, your symptoms reflect a challenging mental health situation that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Severe with Anxious Features</med> accompanied by <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Substance Use Disorder (Alcohol, Nicotine, Prescription Medications)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's report includes persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core features of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, irritability, and feelings of emotional numbness further support this diagnosis. The presence of excessive worry, episodes of <sym>panic</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms of anxiety suggest comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The reports of self-harm thoughts, substance misuse, and self-injurious behaviors raise clinical concern for <med>Substance Use Disorder</med> and potential increased risk for harm, requiring safety assessment. The dissociative experiences and identity questions might indicate additional features that could be explored further but are not sufficient alone for a separate diagnosis at this point. The overall presentation is consistent with a severe mood disorder with comorbid anxiety and substance use issues, all of which are affecting functioning and quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to evaluate risk of self-harm or suicide and establish immediate safety plans if needed.  \n2. Refer to a mental health specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and tailored treatment plan, including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy) and medication management.  \n3. Address substance use by connecting with a substance use counselor or addiction specialist to develop a plan for reduction or cessation and to prevent relapse.  \n4. Implement psychoeducation about mood and anxiety disorders, coping strategies, and healthy lifestyle changes such as sleep hygiene and stress management.  \n5. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and safety, adjusting interventions as needed.",
