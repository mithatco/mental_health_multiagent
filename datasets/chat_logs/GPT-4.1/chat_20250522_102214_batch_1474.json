We will be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, which is a questionnaire designed to get an overall picture of your mental health over the past two weeks. This helps us understand different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe and supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

Your somatic complaints, like headaches and stomachaches, may be related to stress but should be further explored.

The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful assessment and intervention. The sleep disturbances and somatic complaints further support a mood and anxiety disorder presentation. While dissociative symptoms are present, they appear secondary to the mood and anxiety symptoms rather than indicative of a primary dissociative disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk assessment for suicidality, and evaluate for any underlying trauma history.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring of response and side effects.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene techniques and, if necessary, pharmacological support under medical supervision.  \n5. Provide ongoing support and monitor for emergent or worsening symptoms, especially thoughts of self-harm, and involve crisis resources if needed.",

There is notable psychomotor agitation or irritability, alongside persistent anxiety and worry, with episodic feelings of panic and loss of control. Sleep disturbances are evident, characterized by insomnia and non-restorative sleep despite increased sleep duration. Cognitive complaints include concentration difficulties and episodic forgetfulness. The patient reports intrusive, negative ruminative thoughts and feelings of emotional numbness or dissociation, with occasional depersonalization experiences. Additionally, somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches are present, which the patient attributes to stress but warrant further exploration. Expressed thoughts of self-harm, although not accompanied by current plans or intent, represent a significant clinical concern.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a mood disorder with features of depression and anxiety, possibly compounded by dissociative symptoms and passive suicidal ideation. The patient's social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors suggest significant functional impairment. Substance use appears minimal, with no current evidence of substance misuse.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include depressive symptoms with passive suicidal thoughts, dissociative experiences, and social isolation. No overt psychotic symptoms or substance misuse are reported.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with an affective disorder with comorbid anxiety features, along with dissociative experiences and somatic complaints. The presence of passive suicidal ideation necessitates careful risk assessment and close monitoring. Further evaluation should focus on the severity, duration, and impact of these symptoms, as well as consideration of potential underlying diagnoses such as major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and dissociative phenomena.",

      "predicted": "You are clearly going through a very difficult time, experiencing a range of intense and distressing symptoms. You\u2019ve described feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, along with difficulty finding joy in activities you used to enjoy. You also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, episodes of feeling like you might lose control, and avoidance of social situations to prevent feeling overwhelmed. Your sleep has been disturbed, and you experience <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and occasional <sym>dissociative</sym> feelings, such as feeling detached from yourself. The presence of <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym> is concerning and indicates a need for careful monitoring. Your somatic complaints, like headaches and stomachaches, may be related to stress but should be further explored. Overall, it seems you are facing significant emotional and psychological challenges that are impacting your daily functioning and sense of well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and symptoms of <med>dissociative experiences</med> (possible depersonalization).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing <sym>anxiety</sym>, worries, and episodes of feeling <sym>panic</sym> suggest a significant anxiety component, consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The reports of <sym>detachment</sym> from oneself and surroundings, along with feelings of unreality, point toward <med>dissociative symptoms</med>. The presence of <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> warrants careful assessment and intervention. The sleep disturbances and somatic complaints further support a mood and anxiety disorder presentation. While dissociative symptoms are present, they appear secondary to the mood and anxiety symptoms rather than indicative of a primary dissociative disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical assessment, including risk assessment for suicidality, and evaluate for any underlying trauma history.  \n2. Initiate evidence-based treatment such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression and anxiety, along with psychoeducation.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as an <med>SSRI</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>, to address mood and anxiety symptoms, with close monitoring of response and side effects.  \n4. Address sleep issues through sleep hygiene techniques and, if necessary, pharmacological support under medical supervision.  \n5. Provide ongoing support and monitor for emergent or worsening symptoms, especially thoughts of self-harm, and involve crisis resources if needed.",
