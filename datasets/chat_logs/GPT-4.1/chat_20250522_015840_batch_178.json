Today, I will be administering a questionnaire called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us understand various aspects of mental health, including mood, thoughts, sleep, and other areas, to better support your needs. Everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe space for you to express yourself honestly. The assessment involves 23 questions, which ask about your experiences over the past two weeks. I'll ask each question, and you can tell me in your own words how you've been feeling or what you've been experiencing. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

      "content": "You have shared a very complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. You experience persistent <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> with voices commenting on and giving commands, which must be very overwhelming. You also report visual disturbances and feelings of <sym>derealization or dissociation</sym>, such as feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Alongside these, you've described pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and episodic sadness, which seem to weigh heavily on you. Your anxiety is significant, as you often feel <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>panic-like</sym> episodes, especially when hearing voices or seeing things, leading you to avoid certain situations. You mention <sym>irritability</sym> and increased <sym>anger</sym>, along with sleep difficulties, memory problems, and intrusive, disturbing thoughts. Importantly, you have expressed <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, which is a serious concern. Your substance use, including daily smoking, episodic alcohol binges, and unsupervised medication intake, further complicate your mental health and may contribute to the severity of your symptoms. Overall, you seem to be experiencing multiple overlapping symptoms affecting your mood, perception, cognition, and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> (or a related psychotic disorder with mood and anxiety features)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> with voices commenting and commanding, along with <sym>visual disturbances</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, are characteristic of active psychotic symptoms consistent with <med>Schizophrenia</med>. The presence of <sym>delusions of thought broadcasting or mind-reading</sym> further supports this. Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms of <sym>depression</sym> (hopelessness, anhedonia), <sym>anxiety</sym> (nervousness, panic episodes, avoidance), and impaired cognition (memory fog, disorientation), which often co-occur in complex psychotic disorders. The <sym>self-injurious thoughts</sym> indicate increased risk that warrants careful attention. Given the duration of symptoms and their impact on functioning, a diagnosis of <med>Schizophrenia</med> or a related <med>psychotic disorder</med> with mood and anxiety features appears most fitting. It is important to consider that substance use may exacerbate these symptoms, and comorbid mood or anxiety disorders are also likely.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis safety plan, given the <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and active hallucinations.  \n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for comprehensive evaluation, including possible medication management such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about <med>psychotic disorders</med> and involve family or support systems as appropriate.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis and mood symptoms, to help manage hallucinations and distress.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling or referral to addiction services, emphasizing reduction or cessation.  \n6. Regular monitoring of symptoms, safety, and medication adherence, with close follow-up.",

They exhibit pervasive depressive features, including anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and episodic sadness, coupled with significant anxiety evidenced by feelings of nervousness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. Mood symptoms are compounded by irritability and increased anger reactivity. The patient demonstrates sleep disturbances, including insomnia, fatigue, and restlessness, which may exacerbate their emotional and cognitive symptoms.\n\nCognitive concerns are noted, including memory fog, disorientation, and derealization, suggestive of possible dissociative experiences or cognitive impairment. Intrusive thoughts, compulsive-like behaviors, and repetitive mental routines point toward ritualistic or obsessive features. The patient admits to self-injurious ideation, which constitutes a critical safety concern. Substance use includes daily cigarette smoking, episodic alcohol bingeing, and unsupervised intake of medications and other substances, raising concerns about potential substance-related exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms.\n\nNotable patterns include concurrent psychotic, mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, with evidence of social withdrawal and feelings of emotional disconnection, indicative of social isolation and possible affective or psychotic disorder. The patient's self-reported experiences of being misunderstood or dismissed by others highlight potential issues with validation and support.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include active suicidal ideation, auditory and visual hallucinations, substance misuse, and impulsive risk-taking behaviors, all of which necessitate urgent clinical attention and safety planning. The constellation of symptoms warrants comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify diagnoses, assess risk, and formulate an integrated treatment approach.",

      "expected": "schizophrenia",
      "predicted": "You have shared a very complex and distressing picture of your current mental health. You experience persistent <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> with voices commenting on and giving commands, which must be very overwhelming. You also report visual disturbances and feelings of <sym>derealization or dissociation</sym>, such as feeling disconnected from yourself and your surroundings. Alongside these, you've described pervasive <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and episodic sadness, which seem to weigh heavily on you. Your anxiety is significant, as you often feel <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>panic-like</sym> episodes, especially when hearing voices or seeing things, leading you to avoid certain situations. You mention <sym>irritability</sym> and increased <sym>anger</sym>, along with sleep difficulties, memory problems, and intrusive, disturbing thoughts. Importantly, you have expressed <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym>, which is a serious concern. Your substance use, including daily smoking, episodic alcohol binges, and unsupervised medication intake, further complicate your mental health and may contribute to the severity of your symptoms. Overall, you seem to be experiencing multiple overlapping symptoms affecting your mood, perception, cognition, and safety.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> (or a related psychotic disorder with mood and anxiety features)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> with voices commenting and commanding, along with <sym>visual disturbances</sym> and <sym>derealization</sym>, are characteristic of active psychotic symptoms consistent with <med>Schizophrenia</med>. The presence of <sym>delusions of thought broadcasting or mind-reading</sym> further supports this. Additionally, the patient exhibits symptoms of <sym>depression</sym> (hopelessness, anhedonia), <sym>anxiety</sym> (nervousness, panic episodes, avoidance), and impaired cognition (memory fog, disorientation), which often co-occur in complex psychotic disorders. The <sym>self-injurious thoughts</sym> indicate increased risk that warrants careful attention. Given the duration of symptoms and their impact on functioning, a diagnosis of <med>Schizophrenia</med> or a related <med>psychotic disorder</med> with mood and anxiety features appears most fitting. It is important to consider that substance use may exacerbate these symptoms, and comorbid mood or anxiety disorders are also likely.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Immediate safety assessment and development of a crisis safety plan, given the <sym>self-harm thoughts</sym> and active hallucinations.  \n2. Referral to a psychiatrist for comprehensive evaluation, including possible medication management such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about <med>psychotic disorders</med> and involve family or support systems as appropriate.  \n4. Consider psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis and mood symptoms, to help manage hallucinations and distress.  \n5. Address substance use through counseling or referral to addiction services, emphasizing reduction or cessation.  \n6. Regular monitoring of symptoms, safety, and medication adherence, with close follow-up.",
