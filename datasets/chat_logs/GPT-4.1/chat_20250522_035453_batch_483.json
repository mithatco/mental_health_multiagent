Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a questionnaire designed to explore various aspects of your mental health over the past two weeks. The goal is to better understand your experiences and identify any areas that might need further attention. Please know that everything you share is confidential, and this is a safe space for you to be open. I will be asking you 23 questions, one at a time, and I appreciate your honesty in answering them as best as you can. Are you ready to begin?"

Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis, assess risk, and explore potential medical or substance-related causes of psychosis.  \n2. Ensure safety by evaluating the risk of self-harm or harm to others, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about psychotic symptoms and discuss treatment options, including antipsychotic medication if appropriate.  \n4. Provide supportive psychotherapy focusing on stabilization, building coping skills, and addressing feelings of hopelessness and isolation.  \n5. Address comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression with appropriate therapy or medication management.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems if the patient consents, to enhance understanding and support.  \n7.

Key features include pervasive anhedonia and depressive mood characterized by feelings of hopelessness, emotional withdrawal, and anhedonia. There is evidence of heightened irritability, impulsivity, and possible mood instability, as indicated by impulsive project initiation and increased risky behaviors. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reports of persistent worry, restlessness, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors, suggestive of comorbid anxiety disorders.\n\nPsychotic features are evident, including auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), delusional beliefs (thoughts broadcasting, mind-reading), and perceptual disturbances, indicating potential psychosis or severe psychotic spectrum symptoms. The patient reports dissociative phenomena, such as feelings of detachment and derealization, alongside cognitive impairments like memory difficulties and concentration problems. Sleep disturbances are severe, with insomnia and non-restorative sleep contributing to overall functional decline.\n\nThere are concerning indicators of suicidality, with reported thoughts of self-harm or not wanting to be alive, although no active intent or plans are documented. Substance use appears to serve as an maladaptive coping mechanism, evidenced by episodes of alcohol overuse and smoking, often linked to anxiety and restlessness. Additionally, self-medication with non-prescribed medication raises concern regarding potential misuse or substance dependence.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- Co-occurrence of depressive symptoms, psychotic experiences, and anxiety suggests a complex mood disorder with psychotic features or a primary psychotic disorder with mood symptoms.\n- Dissociative and perceptual disturbances point toward possible mood-psychotic disorder, or a comorbid dissociative process.\n- Sleep and cognitive impairments may exacerbate mood and psychotic symptoms.\n- Risk factors include active suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and psychotic phenomena, necessitating careful risk assessment.\n\n**Risk Factors/Warning Signs:**\n- Expressed thoughts of self-harm and hopelessness.\n- Auditory hallucinations and delusional beliefs.\n- Substance use as a maladaptive coping strategy.\n- Dissociative symptoms and cognitive disturbances.\n- Impulsivity and possible behavioral disinhibition.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient exhibits severe mood dysregulation with prominent psychotic features, significant anxiety, dissociation, and substance use behaviors. The presentation indicates high clinical complexity with potential risk for self-harm. Further comprehensive assessment, including safety planning and diagnostic clarification, is warranted to inform an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared a very distressing picture of your current experience. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re going through intense feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. You\u2019ve also described hearing <sym>voices</sym> and experiencing <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> such as thoughts being broadcasted or read. These experiences, along with dissociative feelings of <sym>detachment</sym> and <sym>memory difficulties</sym>, suggest that you\u2019re facing significant mental health challenges that impact multiple areas of your life. It\u2019s understandable that these symptoms can feel overwhelming and confusing, and I want you to know that help is available to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (provisional)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient reports <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>delusional beliefs</sym> (thoughts broadcasting, mind-reading), and perceptual disturbances, which are indicative of <med>psychosis</med>. Additionally, symptoms such as <sym>disconnection from self and surroundings</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> support a psychotic process. The presence of these symptoms alongside significant mood disturbance, anxiety, and substance use suggests a complex clinical picture. Given the reports of <quote>hearing voices</quote> and <quote>believing people can read my mind</quote>, the most fitting provisional diagnosis considers a <med>psychotic disorder</med> that could be secondary to substance use or other medical factors, pending further assessment. The symptoms are severe and include features that may meet criteria for <med>schizophrenia spectrum disorder</med> or a <med>brief psychotic disorder</med>, but further diagnostic clarification is necessary.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to clarify the diagnosis, assess risk, and explore potential medical or substance-related causes of psychosis.  \n2. Ensure safety by evaluating the risk of self-harm or harm to others, and develop a safety plan if needed.  \n3. Initiate psychoeducation about psychotic symptoms and discuss treatment options, including antipsychotic medication if appropriate.  \n4. Provide supportive psychotherapy focusing on stabilization, building coping skills, and addressing feelings of hopelessness and isolation.  \n5. Address comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression with appropriate therapy or medication management.  \n6. Consider involving family or support systems if the patient consents, to enhance understanding and support.  \n7. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptoms, medication effects, and overall functioning.",
