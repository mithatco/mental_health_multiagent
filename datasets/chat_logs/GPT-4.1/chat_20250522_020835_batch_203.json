They report significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling asleep and waking during the night, resulting in ongoing <sym>fatigue</sym>. Cognitive concerns such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation are evident, alongside intrusive <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>. The individual feels <sym>lost</sym> and disconnected from their <sym>identity</sym> and <sym>relationships</sym>, which has led to increased <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. The patient's <sym>somatic complaints</sym> include headaches and body aches, possibly linked to their emotional distress. Substance use, including daily <sym>smoking</sym>, <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, and misuse of <sym>medications</sym>, appears to be an attempt at coping with their distress. They also report <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> but no active intent or plans at this time. Overall, they are experiencing a complex presentation of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms, all contributing to their significant impairment and distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe</med> with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> features, dissociative symptoms, and substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep and cognitive disturbances. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicates comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. Dissociative experiences such as <sym>detachment</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection from self and surroundings</sym> support a notable dissociative component. The patient's use of substances and medications as maladaptive coping strategies further complicate the clinical picture. While passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is present, there are no active plans or intent reported. The complexity and severity of symptoms suggest a need for comprehensive treatment addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and substance use, and to evaluate risk factors for self-harm.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and explore options for crisis support if needed.  \n3. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants and anxiolytics, combined with psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targeting mood regulation, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Refer to addiction specialists or outpatient substance use treatment programs to address alcohol and medication misuse.  \n5. Develop a supportive treatment plan that includes psychoeducation, social support, and strategies to improve sleep, cognitive functioning, and emotional regulation.",

Sleep disturbances characterized by insomnia (Q5, Q15) and fatigue are prominent, alongside cognitive impairments such as memory difficulties (Q16) and disorientation in familiar environments. The patient reports intrusive, ruminative thoughts about past mistakes (Q17), coupled with feelings of detachment or dissociation (Q19), and a loss of identity and purpose (Q20). Social withdrawal and anhedonia extend to interpersonal relationships (Q21), contributing to social isolation.\n\nAnxiety symptoms are evident with reports of chronic worry (Q7), panic episodes (Q8), and avoidance behaviors (Q9). Somatic complaints include occasional headaches and body aches (Q10), which may be somatic manifestations of internal distress. Substance use behaviors are notable, including daily smoking (Q23), significant alcohol consumption (Q22), and misuse of medications (Q24), indicating potential maladaptive coping strategies and substance-related risks.\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include passive suicidal ideation (Q12), marked social withdrawal, substance misuse, and reports of dissociation and identity confusion. The patient's presentation warrants careful assessment of depressive severity, suicidality, substance use disorder, and possible comorbid anxiety or trauma-related conditions.\n\nOverall, the patient's symptom profile aligns with moderate to severe depressive disorder with comorbid generalized anxiety disorder, accompanied by dissociative features, substance misuse, and risk factors for self-harm. Further comprehensive evaluation and safety planning are recommended.",

      "predicted": "The patient describes experiencing a persistent <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest or pleasure</sym> in activities, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. They report significant <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, including difficulty falling asleep and waking during the night, resulting in ongoing <sym>fatigue</sym>. Cognitive concerns such as <sym>memory problems</sym> and disorientation are evident, alongside intrusive <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and feelings of <sym>dissociation</sym>. The individual feels <sym>lost</sym> and disconnected from their <sym>identity</sym> and <sym>relationships</sym>, which has led to increased <sym>social withdrawal</sym>. Anxiety symptoms are prominent, including <sym>chronic worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and avoidance behaviors. The patient's <sym>somatic complaints</sym> include headaches and body aches, possibly linked to their emotional distress. Substance use, including daily <sym>smoking</sym>, <sym>alcohol consumption</sym>, and misuse of <sym>medications</sym>, appears to be an attempt at coping with their distress. They also report <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> but no active intent or plans at this time. Overall, they are experiencing a complex presentation of mood, anxiety, dissociative, and substance use symptoms, all contributing to their significant impairment and distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe</med> with <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med> features, dissociative symptoms, and substance use.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder, severe</med>, including persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and sleep and cognitive disturbances. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicates comorbid <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. Dissociative experiences such as <sym>detachment</sym> and feelings of <sym>disconnection from self and surroundings</sym> support a notable dissociative component. The patient's use of substances and medications as maladaptive coping strategies further complicate the clinical picture. While passive <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is present, there are no active plans or intent reported. The complexity and severity of symptoms suggest a need for comprehensive treatment addressing mood, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and substance use, and to evaluate risk factors for self-harm.  \n2. Initiate a safety plan addressing passive suicidal thoughts and explore options for crisis support if needed.  \n3. Consider evidence-based pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants and anxiolytics, combined with psychotherapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targeting mood regulation, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms.  \n4. Refer to addiction specialists or outpatient substance use treatment programs to address alcohol and medication misuse.  \n5. Develop a supportive treatment plan that includes psychoeducation, social support, and strategies to improve sleep, cognitive functioning, and emotional regulation.",
