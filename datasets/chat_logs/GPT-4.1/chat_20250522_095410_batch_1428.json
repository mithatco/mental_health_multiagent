It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed by <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and mood disturbances</sym>. You also describe intense anxiety, including <sym>panic waves, constant worry, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, which seem to interfere with your daily life. Additionally, you mention episodes of <sym>detachment from yourself and your surroundings, intrusive thoughts, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>. Your concerns about <sym>sleep difficulties, physical pains, and feelings of disconnection from your identity and relationships</sym>, along with reports of <sym>dark thoughts and increased substance use</sym>, indicate a complex mental health picture that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder with Co-occurring Anxiety Features and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The symptoms of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and low energy</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a significant anxiety component, which often co-occurs with depression. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts, dissociation, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> suggest possible mood instability and impulsive features, which may be indicative of a broader mood dysregulation or bipolar spectrum, but current symptoms align most closely with a depressive and anxious presentation. The <sym>heavy alcohol consumption, increased cigarette smoking, and self-medicating with prescription medications</sym> point to a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which is contributing to the overall clinical picture and increasing risk factors. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm and feelings of not being understood</sym> highlight the importance of immediate safety assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate risk of <sym>suicidality</sym>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>dark thoughts and substance use</sym>, including monitoring and removing access to means of harm.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications) as appropriate, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address mood symptoms, emotional regulation, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use disorder</med> and facilitate access to addiction treatment services if needed.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to rebuild connections and reduce feelings of disconnection.  \n7. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider interventions to improve sleep hygiene or pharmacological support if necessary.  \n8. Arrange for ongoing follow-up to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response regularly.",

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary:**\n\n**Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\nThe patient reports pervasive anhedonia and depressive symptoms characterized by diminished interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and persistent low mood. They also endorse significant anxiety features including heightened worry, irritability, and physical symptoms such as headaches and back pain. Notable mood disturbances include episodes of panic, intrusive thoughts, and dissociative experiences, such as feeling detached from self and surroundings. The patient exhibits impulsivity, risky behaviors, and compulsive routines, suggestive of mood instability or possible impulsive features. Sleep disturbances are prominent, with early awakening and non-restorative sleep impacting daily functioning.\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\nThe patient presents with a constellation of affective symptoms (depression, anxiety, irritability), somatic complaints (headaches, back pain), and cognitive disturbances (forgetfulness, dissociation). There is a pattern of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and avoidance behaviors. Substance use appears to be significant, with recent heavy alcohol consumption, increased cigarette smoking, and self-medication with prescription medications, indicating maladaptive coping strategies. The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors suggests possible underlying obsessive-compulsive features or trauma-related symptoms.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major depressive symptoms with anhedonia and hopelessness\n- Anxiety spectrum features, including panic and generalized worry\n- Dissociative symptoms indicating possible depersonalization or derealization\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors requiring assessment for mood instability or bipolar spectrum features\n- Elevated substance use and self-medication, raising concerns about substance use disorder\n- Suicidal ideation risk, given reports of dark thoughts and feelings of wanting to escape\n- Sleep disturbance impacting mood and cognition\n- Somatic complaints with unclear etiology, potentially linked to psychological distress\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Reports of thoughts of self-harm or escape, though no current plans or intent described\n- Increased substance use and self-medication, which may increase risk of overdose or adverse health outcomes\n- Feelings of disconnection and identity confusion, warranting careful assessment for suicidality and psychosis\n- Impulsivity and risky behaviors that could lead to harm\n- Anxiety and panic symptoms that may impair functioning or escalate under stress\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by major depressive symptoms, pervasive anxiety, dissociative experiences, impulsivity, and significant substance use. These features suggest the need for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to assess mood disorder severity, suicidality risk, substance use impact, and possible comorbidities such as anxiety disorders or dissociative conditions. Immediate safety assessment is indicated given reports of dark thoughts and substance use patterns. An integrated treatment approach addressing mood stabilization, anxiety management, substance use, and safety planning is recommended.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a very distressing and complex set of experiences that reflect significant emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed by <sym>persistent feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and mood disturbances</sym>. You also describe intense anxiety, including <sym>panic waves, constant worry, and avoidance behaviors</sym>, which seem to interfere with your daily life. Additionally, you mention episodes of <sym>detachment from yourself and your surroundings, intrusive thoughts, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym>. Your concerns about <sym>sleep difficulties, physical pains, and feelings of disconnection from your identity and relationships</sym>, along with reports of <sym>dark thoughts and increased substance use</sym>, indicate a complex mental health picture that warrants careful attention and support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, likely Major Depressive Disorder with Co-occurring Anxiety Features and Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The symptoms of <sym>depressed mood, anhedonia, hopelessness, and low energy</sym> are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of pervasive <sym>anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a significant anxiety component, which often co-occurs with depression. The reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts, dissociation, impulsivity, and risky behaviors</sym> suggest possible mood instability and impulsive features, which may be indicative of a broader mood dysregulation or bipolar spectrum, but current symptoms align most closely with a depressive and anxious presentation. The <sym>heavy alcohol consumption, increased cigarette smoking, and self-medicating with prescription medications</sym> point to a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, which is contributing to the overall clinical picture and increasing risk factors. The <sym>thoughts of self-harm and feelings of not being understood</sym> highlight the importance of immediate safety assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and evaluate risk of <sym>suicidality</sym>.  \n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>dark thoughts and substance use</sym>, including monitoring and removing access to means of harm.  \n3. Initiate or adjust pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications) as appropriate, in consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Recommend psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address mood symptoms, emotional regulation, and maladaptive coping strategies.  \n5. Provide psychoeducation about <med>substance use disorder</med> and facilitate access to addiction treatment services if needed.  \n6. Encourage engagement in supportive social activities gradually to rebuild connections and reduce feelings of disconnection.  \n7. Monitor sleep patterns closely and consider interventions to improve sleep hygiene or pharmacological support if necessary.  \n8. Arrange for ongoing follow-up to reassess symptoms, safety, and treatment response regularly.",
