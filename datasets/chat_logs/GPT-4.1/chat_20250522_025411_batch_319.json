Please know that everything you share is confidential, and my goal is to create a safe, supportive space for you. We'll go through 23 questions, one at a time, covering different aspects like mood, energy, anxiety, and more. Are you ready to begin with the first question?"

It\u2019s clear that you've been struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed and episodes of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also described <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, which impact your daily life. During certain periods, you've experienced <sym>high energy</sym>, <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, and impulsive behaviors, indicating mood swings that include both depressive and elevated states. Physical symptoms like <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>tension</sym> are present, along with sleep disturbances and some tendencies toward <sym>substance use</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about yourself</sym>, as well as <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning. Your experiences suggest a mood disorder with significant mood variability, possibly involving bipolar features, along with anxiety and dissociative symptoms. Your honesty about these struggles is important, and you are not alone in facing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate to severe, with mixed features</med> and co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits clear episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical aches</sym>, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> characterized by <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>excessive energy</sym>. The mood shifts appear to be at least one week long, with some features of <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> and impulsivity warrants careful risk assessment. The physical symptoms and sleep disturbances are consistent with mood episodes, and substance use may be serving as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes with mixed features, irritability, and mood instability points toward a bipolar spectrum diagnosis with comorbid anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history of mood episodes, to confirm bipolar diagnosis and assess for other comorbidities.  \n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.  \n3. Assess and address substance use, including providing education about its impact on mood stability and considering referral to addiction services if appropriate.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and implement safety planning, including crisis intervention resources if needed.  \n5. Address anxiety symptoms through appropriate therapeutic approaches and, if indicated, pharmacotherapy.",

Physical complaints such as unexplained aches and tension, along with sleep disturbances\u2014both hypersomnia and insomnia\u2014are evident and impact overall functioning.\n\nPattern analysis reveals significant mood variability, with depressive episodes interspersed with periods of elevated or irritable mood and hyperactivity. Substance use behaviors, including alcohol consumption and self-medication with prescription sleep aids, are present and may serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms. The patient also reports passive suicidal ideation without specific plans, indicating an elevated risk for self-harm.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include mood dysregulation, comorbid anxiety symptoms, substance use, and possible bipolar disorder. The patient's dissociative experiences and feelings of detachment warrant further exploration. Risk factors of concern include suicidal ideation, impulsivity during high mood states, and substance use, which could exacerbate mood instability.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a complex presentation characterized by mood episodes consistent with bipolar disorder spectrum features, significant depressive symptoms, anxiety, dissociation, and substance use, requiring comprehensive assessment and stabilization planning.",

The reasoning provided references mood episodes with significant variability, including depressive and elevated (manic/hypomanic) features, characteristic of bipolar disorder. The mention of mood swings, mixed features, and bipolar spectrum diagnosis confirms the match.",

      "predicted": "You have shared a complex picture of your mental health experiences. It\u2019s clear that you've been struggling with persistent <sym>depressive feelings</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed and episodes of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also described <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>, which impact your daily life. During certain periods, you've experienced <sym>high energy</sym>, <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, and impulsive behaviors, indicating mood swings that include both depressive and elevated states. Physical symptoms like <sym>aches</sym> and <sym>tension</sym> are present, along with sleep disturbances and some tendencies toward <sym>substance use</sym>. You\u2019ve expressed feelings of <sym>disconnection</sym> and <sym>uncertainty about yourself</sym>, as well as <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, which are concerning. Your experiences suggest a mood disorder with significant mood variability, possibly involving bipolar features, along with anxiety and dissociative symptoms. Your honesty about these struggles is important, and you are not alone in facing these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar I Disorder, current episode depressed, moderate to severe, with mixed features</med> and co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder, unspecified</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient exhibits clear episodes of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>physical aches</sym>, alongside episodes of <sym>elevated mood</sym> characterized by <sym>reduced sleep</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, <sym>risky behaviors</sym>, and <sym>excessive energy</sym>. The mood shifts appear to be at least one week long, with some features of <med>Bipolar I disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and dissociative experiences suggest comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's report of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym> and impulsivity warrants careful risk assessment. The physical symptoms and sleep disturbances are consistent with mood episodes, and substance use may be serving as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Overall, the pattern of mood episodes with mixed features, irritability, and mood instability points toward a bipolar spectrum diagnosis with comorbid anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including a detailed history of mood episodes, to confirm bipolar diagnosis and assess for other comorbidities.  \n2. Develop an integrated treatment plan that may include mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate), psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy), and psychoeducation about mood regulation.  \n3. Assess and address substance use, including providing education about its impact on mood stability and considering referral to addiction services if appropriate.  \n4. Monitor for suicidal ideation and implement safety planning, including crisis intervention resources if needed.  \n5. Address anxiety symptoms through appropriate therapeutic approaches and, if indicated, pharmacotherapy.",
