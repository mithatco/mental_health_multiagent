The dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts could point to additional features, but they do not currently meet criteria for a specific dissociative or obsessive-compulsive disorder. No evidence suggests <sym>psychosis</sym> or <sym>self-harm</sym> behaviors at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for a formal diagnosis and to assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, pharmacological support.  \n4. Explore stress management techniques, including mindfulness or relaxation exercises.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in symptoms, particularly thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or worsening anxiety, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n6.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Assessment Summary:**\n\nThe patient presents with pervasive symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depressive and anxiety features. Key concerns include persistent anhedonia and feelings of hopelessness, evidenced by reports of diminished interest in activities and ongoing low mood. There is notable irritability, tension, and physical symptoms such as headaches, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep and frequent awakenings. Cognitive complaints include memory issues and disorientation, often exacerbated by anxiety.\n\nThe patient reports significant anxiety symptoms, including pervasive worry, feelings of being on edge, and panic episodes characterized by physical sensations like heart racing and shortness of breath. Avoidance behaviors related to social situations and concerns about panic attacks are also evident. Intrusive thoughts, compulsive checking behaviors, and dissociative experiences suggest possible obsessive-compulsive or trauma-related features.\n\nSubstance use appears minimal, with no recent alcohol misuse or tobacco use, and no evidence of recent non-prescribed medication or drug misuse.\n\n**Patterns and Clinical Significance:**\n- The constellation of mood disturbance, anhedonia, and hopelessness suggests depressive pathology.\n- Prominent anxiety symptoms, including panic and avoidance, indicate comorbid anxiety disorder features.\n- Physical and cognitive symptoms support the presence of somatic and cognitive manifestations of mood and anxiety disorders.\n- Dissociative experiences and intrusive thoughts may warrant further assessment for trauma-related or obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n- Feelings of hopelessness and pervasive distress elevate risk for worsening depressive symptoms.\n- Presence of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors suggest potential for functional impairment.\n- No current suicidal ideation or intent reported; however, ongoing hopelessness warrants close monitoring.\n\n**Observations:**\nThe patient's self-reports reflect significant emotional distress characterized by depressive and anxious symptom clusters, accompanied by somatic complaints and cognitive disturbances. The pattern indicates a need for comprehensive evaluation to delineate diagnoses, assess risk, and inform treatment planning, with particular attention to mood stabilization, anxiety management, and addressing functional impairments.",

      "predicted": "You\u2019ve shared that you're experiencing persistent feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including a lack of <sym>interest or pleasure</sym> in activities you used to enjoy and a sense of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You've also described feeling <sym>irritable</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> most of the time, with physical symptoms like <sym>headaches</sym>, <sym>stomachaches</sym>, and muscle tension. Sleep has been disrupted, with difficulties falling asleep and waking frequently, leaving you feeling restless and unrefreshed. Additionally, you've noticed some <sym>forgetfulness</sym> and moments of feeling detached or outside of yourself. Anxiety seems to be a significant component, with pervasive worry, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance of situations that might trigger these feelings. Despite these challenges, you have not experienced thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or hearing/seeing things that aren't there, and you do not misuse substances. Overall, you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by emotional and physical symptoms that interfere with your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder (likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder)</med> and somatic symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of persistent <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> over the past two weeks align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as headaches, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances suggests somatic manifestations often associated with depression. The pervasive <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors indicate a strong component of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, likely <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, given the broad worry and physical symptoms. The dissociative feelings and intrusive thoughts could point to additional features, but they do not currently meet criteria for a specific dissociative or obsessive-compulsive disorder. No evidence suggests <sym>psychosis</sym> or <sym>self-harm</sym> behaviors at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for a formal diagnosis and to assess severity.  \n2. Consider starting evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants) targeting depression and anxiety symptoms.  \n3. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral strategies and, if appropriate, pharmacological support.  \n4. Explore stress management techniques, including mindfulness or relaxation exercises.  \n5. Monitor for any escalation in symptoms, particularly thoughts of <sym>self-harm</sym> or worsening anxiety, and provide safety planning if needed.  \n6. Consider referral to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or therapist with experience in mood and anxiety disorders, for ongoing support.",
