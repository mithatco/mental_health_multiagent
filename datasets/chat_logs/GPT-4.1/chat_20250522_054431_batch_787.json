Conduct a thorough clinical interview to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and suicidality, including risk assessment.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) tailored to depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, especially if symptoms are severe or persistent.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in thoughts of self-harm or suicidality, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n5. Encourage supportive measures, including regular sleep routines, physical activity, and social engagement as tolerated.  \n6.

Key symptoms include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness, fatigue, hypersomnia with early morning awakening, and concentration difficulties. Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, characterized by generalized worry, irritability, social withdrawal, and avoidance behaviors, suggesting comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient reports intrusive negative thoughts and mild dissociative feelings, though no psychotic features or hallucinations are evident. Physical complaints such as headaches and muscle aches may be somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nPatterns of concern include persistent low mood, anhedonia, social withdrawal, impaired concentration, and disturbances in sleep affecting daytime functioning. The patient's self-reported thoughts of death, although without intent or planning, warrant careful monitoring for suicidality. The absence of substance misuse and psychotic symptoms is noted.\n\nRisk factors or warning signs include:\n- Suicidal ideation (thoughts of death)\n- Significant functional impairment (withdrawal, concentration issues)\n- Sleep disturbances and fatigue\n- Feelings of hopelessness and emotional numbness\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits a clinical profile characterized by depressive and anxiety symptoms with associated cognitive and somatic complaints, indicating a need for comprehensive assessment and potential intervention to address mood, anxiety, and suicidality concerns.",

      "expected": "depression",
      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging feelings and thoughts over the past few weeks. You mention persistent <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You also report difficulties with <sym>sleeping early and waking up very early</sym> despite feeling <sym>restless and exhausted</sym>. Your concentration has decreased, and you're finding it hard to focus at work. Social withdrawal and avoidance of crowded or social situations are also significant issues for you. Additionally, you've had <sym>intrusive negative thoughts about yourself</sym> and some <sym>thoughts about death</sym>, which are concerning. Anxiety symptoms such as excessive worry, feeling overwhelmed, and physical sensations like feeling unable to breathe or control your thoughts are present, though you haven't experienced panic attacks. You mention feeling somewhat disconnected from your sense of self and experiencing confusion about your identity, along with withdrawal from loved ones. Physical symptoms like headaches and muscle aches are also noted, which may be linked to your emotional distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms include pervasive <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, fatigue, early morning awakening, concentration difficulties, and feelings of hopelessness, which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of excessive worry, social avoidance, physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle aches, and feelings of being overwhelmed align with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The thoughts of death, although not accompanied by intent or planning, indicate some level of distress that warrants careful monitoring. The symptoms are impacting daily functioning and are consistent with a clinical presentation of depression and anxiety comorbidities, without evidence of psychosis or substance misuse.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a thorough clinical interview to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, and suicidality, including risk assessment.  \n2. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) tailored to depression and anxiety.  \n3. Evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, especially if symptoms are severe or persistent.  \n4. Monitor for any escalation in thoughts of self-harm or suicidality, and develop a safety plan if necessary.  \n5. Encourage supportive measures, including regular sleep routines, physical activity, and social engagement as tolerated.  \n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to assess treatment response and adjust interventions accordingly.",
