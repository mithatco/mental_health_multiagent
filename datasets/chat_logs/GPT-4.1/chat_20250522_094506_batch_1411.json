There is notable psychomotor retardation or fatigue evidenced by reports of exhaustion limiting engagement in activities (Q6). Cognitive concerns are apparent, with reported memory difficulties and disorientation (Q16), alongside feelings of confusion about identity and purpose (Q20).\n\nAnxious features are also observed, including excessive worry about various life stressors (Q7), avoidance behaviors related to social situations (Q9), and occasional feelings of fear or distress without full-blown panic attacks (Q8). The patient reports recurrent negative ruminative thoughts (Q17), as well as dissociative experiences characterized by feelings of detachment or being outside oneself (Q19). There are no indications of hallucinations, delusions, or perceptual disturbances, and substance use appears minimal or absent (Q22\u2013Q24).\n\nRisk factors and warning signs include thoughts of self-harm without plans (Q12), which require careful assessment for severity and intent. The patient\u2019s withdrawal from social relationships and feelings of emotional numbness (Q21) further underscore clinical concerns related to social isolation and emotional dysregulation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis individual exhibits symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder, accompanied by notable anxiety, cognitive impairment, sleep disruption, and dissociative experiences. The presence of passive suicidal ideation warrants ongoing safety assessment. No current substance misuse or psychotic features are reported. Further comprehensive evaluation is recommended to determine diagnosis, severity, and appropriate intervention strategies.",

      "predicted": "You have shared that you've been experiencing a range of challenging symptoms recently. You\u2019ve felt <sym>persistent sadness</sym> and <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities you once enjoyed, along with feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>. You mentioned difficulty sleeping, particularly waking up very early and feeling tired during the day, as well as some <sym>memory problems</sym> and feelings of <sym>detachment or being outside of yourself</sym>. You've also expressed <sym>anxiety about various concerns</sym>, avoiding social situations because they feel overwhelming, and having <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> at times, though not with any specific plan. It\u2019s understandable that these experiences are overwhelming and have impacted your overall sense of well-being and connection with others.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>major depression</med>, such as <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, lasting over a two-week period. The presence of sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and social withdrawal further support this diagnosis. There are also notable <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, which often coexist with depression, and the reported <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> necessitate careful monitoring. While some symptoms overlap with other disorders, the pattern here aligns with a depressive episode, with additional features that may complicate the clinical picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive clinical interview to explore the severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, including risk assessment for self-harm.\n2. Develop a safety plan addressing <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> and <sym>self-harm risk</sym>.\n3. Consider initiating evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>.\n4. Evaluate the need for pharmacologic intervention with a psychiatrist if symptoms are significantly impairing.\n5. Monitor sleep patterns and consider behavioral strategies or medical evaluation to address sleep disturbances.\n6. Assess for any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to symptoms, such as thyroid issues or neurological concerns.\n7. Schedule regular follow-up to reassess symptoms and treatment response, adjusting the plan as needed.",
