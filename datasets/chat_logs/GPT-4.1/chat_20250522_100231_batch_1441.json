Today, I will be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Please know that everything you share here is confidential, and my goal is to provide a safe, supportive space for you. The assessment includes 23 questions covering different areas like mood, anxiety, sleep, and more. I will ask you each question one at a time, and you can answer honestly and openly. Are you ready to begin?"

You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> and hopelessness, as well as heightened <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with persistent worries and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and fragmented rest, are affecting your functioning, and you\u2019ve noticed some cognitive difficulties like forgetfulness and feeling disoriented. Additionally, you've described engaging in impulsive behaviors and risky activities, avoiding social situations due to fear of panic, and experiencing intrusive, disturbing thoughts along with routines that help soothe your anxiety. You\u2019ve also reported <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself, questioning your identity, and withdrawing from close relationships. Importantly, you\u2019ve acknowledged <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without current plans, which indicates a need for careful safety monitoring. Substance use, particularly episodic alcohol consumption and smoking, seems to be a way you cope with stress, though it\u2019s not excessive at this time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and features of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like symptoms and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s predominant symptoms include persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and hopelessness, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, feeling on edge, and episodic panic attacks suggest significant <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of intrusive thoughts, compulsive routines, and dissociative feelings points toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like features and dissociative phenomena. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, impulsivity, and social withdrawal further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. The passive suicidal thoughts require ongoing assessment but do not currently indicate an active plan, although they warrant close monitoring. The substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary substance dependence.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and risk.  \n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), after consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties, possibly involving neuropsychological testing or consultation with a specialist.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and develop a safety plan for suicidal thoughts.",

They report increased irritability and irritability-related behaviors, alongside significant anxiety symptoms marked by persistent worry, feeling on edge, and episodes of panic with corresponding physical sensations (e.g., racing heart, shortness of breath). Sleep disturbances are evident, including reduced sleep duration and fragmentation, accompanied by subjective cognitive impairment such as forgetfulness and disorientation, which may indicate cognitive or neurological concerns.\n\nThe patient exhibits behavioral risk factors, including impulsivity (starting new projects and engaging in risky behaviors) and avoidance of social situations due to fear of panic attacks, indicative of social anxiety or agoraphobic tendencies. Intrusive, distressing thoughts are noted, alongside compulsive-like routines (rechecking behaviors), reflecting possible obsessive-compulsive features. Dissociative experiences, such as depersonalization or derealization, are reported, alongside identity questioning and social withdrawal, which may suggest underlying dissociative or identity-related issues.\n\nOf concern are passive suicidal ideation without active plans, indicating a potential risk that warrants ongoing safety assessment. Substance use behaviors, specifically episodic alcohol consumption and smoking tied to stress, are present but do not appear to be compulsive or excessive at this time.\n\nPotential clinical considerations include mood disorder (major depression), anxiety disorder (generalized or panic), dissociative symptoms, and substance use issues. The patient's presentation warrants comprehensive assessment of suicidality, mood stability, anxiety severity, dissociative phenomena, and cognitive functioning. The observed symptoms and behaviors denote significant functional impairment and highlight the importance of safety planning and targeted interventions.",

      "predicted": "You appear to be experiencing a complex and distressing mixture of symptoms that significantly impact your daily life. You\u2019ve shared feelings of <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> and hopelessness, as well as heightened <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, with persistent worries and episodes of <sym>panic</sym>. Sleep disturbances, such as <sym>reduced sleep</sym> and fragmented rest, are affecting your functioning, and you\u2019ve noticed some cognitive difficulties like forgetfulness and feeling disoriented. Additionally, you've described engaging in impulsive behaviors and risky activities, avoiding social situations due to fear of panic, and experiencing intrusive, disturbing thoughts along with routines that help soothe your anxiety. You\u2019ve also reported <sym>dissociative experiences</sym>, such as feeling detached from yourself, questioning your identity, and withdrawing from close relationships. Importantly, you\u2019ve acknowledged <sym>passive suicidal thoughts</sym> without current plans, which indicates a need for careful safety monitoring. Substance use, particularly episodic alcohol consumption and smoking, seems to be a way you cope with stress, though it\u2019s not excessive at this time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with comorbid <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and features of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like symptoms and dissociative experiences.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient\u2019s predominant symptoms include persistent <sym>depressive mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and hopelessness, which align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The ongoing worry, feeling on edge, and episodic panic attacks suggest significant <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms consistent with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of intrusive thoughts, compulsive routines, and dissociative feelings points toward <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>-like features and dissociative phenomena. Sleep disturbances, cognitive issues, impulsivity, and social withdrawal further support a complex mood and anxiety presentation. The passive suicidal thoughts require ongoing assessment but do not currently indicate an active plan, although they warrant close monitoring. The substance use appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism rather than primary substance dependence.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Conduct a comprehensive safety assessment focusing on suicidal ideation and risk.  \n2. Initiate or adjust evidence-based treatments such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> targeting depression, anxiety, and compulsive behaviors.  \n3. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs), after consultation with a psychiatrist.  \n4. Address sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and, if appropriate, medical evaluation for sleep disorders.  \n5. Explore additional assessments for dissociative symptoms and cognitive difficulties, possibly involving neuropsychological testing or consultation with a specialist.  \n6. Provide psychoeducation about symptoms and coping strategies, and develop a safety plan for suicidal thoughts.",
