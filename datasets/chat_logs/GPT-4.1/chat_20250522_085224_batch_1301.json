Initiate a comprehensive mental health treatment plan, including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address depressive and anxious symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medications, after consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and impact on daily functioning.  \n3. Conduct a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms.  \n4. Establish safety planning and regular monitoring for suicidal thoughts, ensuring the patient has access to crisis support if needed.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and social connections as tolerated to reduce feelings of isolation.",

Anxiety is prominent, with persistent worry, agitation, and episodic panic attacks. Sleep disturbances are noted, with disrupted sleep patterns including insomnia and difficulty maintaining restful sleep. Cognitive concerns include concentration difficulties and memory impairment. Intrusive negative thoughts are present, alongside feelings of emotional numbness and derealization, indicating dissociative experiences. The patient also reports somatic complaints such as unexplained headaches and stomachaches, which may reflect somatic manifestations of psychological distress.\n\nPattern analysis reveals a co-occurrence of depressive and anxious symptoms, with evidence of mood dysregulation and cognitive impairment. The patient denies hallucinations, delusions, or compulsive behaviors, and reports no substance use or risky behaviors.\n\nPotential clinical concerns include major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder, dissociative features, and somatic symptom presentation. The reported passive suicidal thoughts, without active planning or intent, constitute a significant risk factor requiring ongoing monitoring.\n\nIn summary, the patient exhibits symptoms consistent with moderate to severe depression and generalized anxiety, accompanied by dissociative experiences and somatic complaints. These findings warrant comprehensive assessment and integrated intervention planning to address mood, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, with careful attention to suicidality.",

You sometimes feel <sym>detached or numb</sym>, as if you\u2019re watching yourself from outside, and you\u2019ve had <sym>intrusive negative thoughts</sym>. You acknowledge having <sym>passive thoughts of self-harm</sym>, but no active plans or intentions. Overall, you are going through a very challenging time marked by mood, anxiety, cognitive, and somatic symptoms, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share this with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation includes core symptoms of <med>depression</med>, such as <sym>decreased interest or pleasure, feelings of sadness and hopelessness, social withdrawal, and difficulty with sleep and concentration</sym>. The presence of persistent <sym>anxiety, worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym> supports the diagnosis of <med>generalized anxiety disorder</med>. The dissociative experiences like feeling numb or outside of oneself, along with somatic complaints such as headaches and stomachaches, suggest somatic manifestations of psychological distress but do not meet criteria for somatic symptom disorder at this time. The passive <sym>suicidal thoughts</sym> warrant close monitoring but do not indicate active plans or intent. Overall, the symptom profile aligns with a mood disorder complicated by significant anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**  \n1. Initiate a comprehensive mental health treatment plan, including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address depressive and anxious symptoms.  \n2. Consider pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressant medications, after consultation with a psychiatrist, especially given the severity of symptoms and impact on daily functioning.  \n3. Conduct a thorough medical evaluation to rule out any underlying physical health issues contributing to somatic symptoms.  \n4. Establish safety planning and regular monitoring for suicidal thoughts, ensuring the patient has access to crisis support if needed.  \n5. Encourage engagement in supportive activities and social connections as tolerated to reduce feelings of isolation.",
