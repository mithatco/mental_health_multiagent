This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Their reports of mood instability, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors suggest potential diagnostic considerations for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use without a prescription highlight significant risk factors that require immediate attention. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.",
