You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a heavy weight on you all the time. It's clear that <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> have been significant issues, making everyday situations feel overwhelming. Your sleep has been poor, and you've been experiencing <sym>memory difficulties</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairment</sym>. You've also shared <quote>thoughts of not wanting to be here</quote> and feeling like a burden to others. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> further supports this diagnosis. While anxiety symptoms are also present, they appear to be secondary to the depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm <med>MDD</med> and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan, including <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants) and <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).\n3. <med>Safety planning</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure patient safety.\n4. <med>Referral to a mental health specialist</med> for ongoing therapy and support.\n5. Encouragement of <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support.",
