      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and <sym>irritability</sym> in social situations, which can make you feel like you're just going through the motions. You mentioned feeling <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> at times, especially when you're alone at night, and that these feelings can be overwhelming. It's clear that anxiety is a significant source of distress for you, causing you to avoid social situations and feel detached from others. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>fear</sym> in social situations, which leads to avoidance of these situations (Q8) and significant distress (Q6). The patient's reports of feeling <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> (Q2), as well as <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3), suggest a potential comorbid <med>depressive disorder</med>, but the primary symptoms appear to be related to social anxiety. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> as outlined in the DSM-5.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce avoidance behaviors.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to assess for potential comorbid <med>depressive disorders</med> or other mental health conditions.\n5. Consideration of medication, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage symptoms of <med>social anxiety disorder</med>.",
