The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
