I feel like I'm just so overwhelmed sometimes. I don't know if I would actually do anything, but it's hard to see a way out sometimes.\") indicates potential suicidal thoughts or feelings of hopelessness.\n2. **Substance Use:** Although the patient denies using substances (Q21-23), their reported use of wine (Q21) may warrant further exploration.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile, characterized by significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, emotional regulation difficulties, and somatic complaints. The patient's recent divorce and reported emotional distress may contribute to their current mental health concerns. The presence of suicidal ideation and potential trauma-related issues necessitate careful assessment and treatment planning. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan addressing the patient's specific needs are warranted.",
