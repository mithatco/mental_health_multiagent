          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, including:\n\n- **Depressed mood:** The patient expressed feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a notable decrease in interest or pleasure in activities they used to enjoy.\n- **Anxiety:** The patient experiences anxiety, worry, and panic attacks, indicating a high level of distress.\n- **Irritability:** The patient reports increased irritability and frustration.\n- **Sleep disturbances:** The patient experiences excessive sleep, fatigue, and overall poor sleep quality.\n- **Cognitive difficulties:** The patient reports trouble concentrating, memory issues, and a general feeling of mental fogginess.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Depressive symptoms:** The patient's responses suggest a pattern of depressive symptoms that started after significant life events (job loss and relationship end).\n- **Anxiety and worry:** The patient exhibits a pervasive pattern of worry about their future, finances, and relationships.\n- **Avoidance behaviors:** The patient avoids social and potentially enjoyable activities due to anxiety and feelings of overwhelm.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** The patient's symptoms align with criteria for MDD, including depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** The patient's experiences of anxiety, worry, and panic attacks suggest the presence of an anxiety disorder, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the patient's significant life events could potentially trigger PTSD symptoms; further assessment is warranted.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves but denies any intent to act on these thoughts. This indicates a need for close monitoring and possible crisis intervention planning.\n- **Substance use:** The patient denies using substances, which is positive but should be monitored as a protective factor.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, likely meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and possibly an anxiety disorder. The patient's recent life events appear to have triggered these symptoms. Suicidal ideation without intent is noted, requiring careful assessment and management. Cognitive and sleep disturbances further complicate the clinical picture. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan focusing on depression, anxiety, and coping strategies are warranted.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n- Panic Disorder\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (further assessment needed)\n\n**Treatment Approach:**\n\n- **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), or psychodynamic therapy may be beneficial.\n- **Pharmacotherapy:** Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) could be considered for managing depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Conduct a detailed diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., PTSD screen) to confirm the diagnosis.\n- Develop a treatment plan tailored to the patient's needs, including therapy and possible medication.\n- Establish a safety plan given the patient's suicidal ideation.\n\n**Confidentiality and informed consent have been established, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for the patient to explore their mental health concerns.**",

It sounds like everything started to feel <quote>really dark</quote> after your job and relationship ended. You're experiencing <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which can be really scary and affect your daily life. You're also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>physical aches and pains</sym> that are making it hard for you to cope. It's clear that you're struggling and looking for support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, changes in <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>energy</sym>, and feelings of <sym>worthlessness</sym> or <sym>guilt</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> suggests a high level of anxious distress, which is a common specifier for MDD.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., <med>PTSD</med> screen) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan focusing on <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>, including <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>) and possible <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRIs</med>).\n3. Establish a <med>safety plan</med> given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them comfort and <sym>pleasure</sym>, and to maintain a <med>self-care</med> routine.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
