This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's mental health status.",

The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively used the patient's disclosures to guide subsequent inquiries. For instance, after the patient mentioned avoiding situations that remind them of the accident, the therapist followed up with questions about anxiety and avoidance behaviors. The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression, with no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",

The therapist cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as intrusive thoughts, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, irritability, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, which are all consistent with PTSD. The therapist also considered the patient's feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to differential diagnosis.",
