The patient's symptoms suggest potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and one or more anxiety disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation and avoidance behavior highlights the need for immediate attention and intervention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are warranted to address the patient's complex needs.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **In-depth Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to determine the presence of specific mental health conditions.\n2. **Crisis Intervention:** Address the patient's suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan to mitigate risk.\n3. **Development of a Treatment Plan:** Create a treatment plan that addresses the patient's depressive, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, as well as their physical and social functioning.",
