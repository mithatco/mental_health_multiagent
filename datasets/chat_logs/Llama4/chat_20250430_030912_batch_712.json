I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, characterized by a persistent and excessive fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others <quote>\"I feel like I'm under a microscope\"</quote>.

Co-occurring <med>depressive</med> symptoms are evident, including <sym>feelings of sadness</sym> <quote>\"Yeah, I've been feeling down more often than I'd like\"</quote> and <sym>lack of enjoyment</sym> in activities.
