This tool helps us understand various mental health domains and identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
