The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things? On a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is 'None / Not at all' and 4 is 'Severe / Nearly every day', how would you rate your experience over the past two weeks?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed 20 out of 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Most domains were explored, including depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and cognitive function. However, the therapist skipped or didn't adequately follow up on questions related to mania (questions 4 and 5), psychotic symptoms (questions 12 and 13), and substance use (questions 21, 22, and 23). The conversation primarily focused on depressive and anxiety symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, accurately targeting clinical symptoms. However, some questions were phrased vaguely or lacked specificity, which might have led to minor inaccuracies in capturing the patient's experiences. For example, the question about 'problems with sleep that affected your sleep quality overall' could have been more precise by directly referencing sleep disturbances as per DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the therapist could have probed deeper or asked follow-up questions. For example, when the patient mentioned suicidal ideation, the therapist could have explored this further but instead moved on to the next question. Overall, the conversation maintained coherence and understanding.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety and sleep disturbances clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms. The therapist provided a reasonable justification for the diagnoses, citing specific symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, and anxiety. However, the differential diagnosis process could have been more comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses were not explicitly ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses demonstrated empathy and a professional tone. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences.
