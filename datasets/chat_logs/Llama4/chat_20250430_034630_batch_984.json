Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n- **Social Anxiety:** The patient reports significant distress in social situations, fear of being judged, and avoidance of social gatherings.\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Occasional feelings of being down, especially after social events where the patient felt embarrassed.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Frequent feelings of nervousness, being on edge, and panic, particularly in social situations.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Trouble sleeping before big days or events.\n- **Rumination:** Recurring thoughts about social interactions and fear of negative evaluation.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n- **Social Context Dependency:** Symptoms and distress are predominantly reported in social contexts.\n- **Intermittent Symptom Experience:** The patient experiences symptoms episodically, particularly triggered by social events or anticipation of such events.\n- **Self-Reported Avoidance Behavior:** The patient actively avoids situations that increase anxiety.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** Significant avoidance of social situations due to fear of embarrassment or negative evaluation.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Although not constant, feelings of hopelessness or being down, especially post-social events.\n- **Generalized Anxiety:** Persistent worry about social interactions and performance.\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Difficulty sleeping, particularly related to anxiety about upcoming events.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Not explicitly reported, but the patient wishes they could feel more confident in social situations, indicating distress.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies use of illicit substances or misuse of prescription medications.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\nThe patient presents with **predominant symptoms of social anxiety**, including significant distress in social situations, fear of negative evaluation, and avoidance of social gatherings. **Depressive symptoms** are present but appear to be situational and less frequent. **Anxiety and sleep disturbances** are also noted, often in anticipation of or following social events. The patient's experiences suggest potential diagnoses of **Social Anxiety Disorder** and possible **Depressive Disorder**, with **sleep disturbances** likely related to anxiety. No immediate risk factors for suicidal behavior or substance use disorders were identified. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm these observations and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Considerations:**\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23):** Marked fear of one or more social situations in which the person is concerned about being evaluated by others.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (296.32):** Although less frequent, episodes of feeling down.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02):** Persistent worry that is difficult to control.\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:**\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically social skills training and exposure therapy, may be beneficial.\n- Assessment and potential treatment for depressive symptoms.\n- Strategies for improving sleep hygiene.\n\nThis summary focuses on extracting relevant clinical information directly from the patient's responses, avoiding speculation, and highlighting areas for further clinical investigation and intervention.",
