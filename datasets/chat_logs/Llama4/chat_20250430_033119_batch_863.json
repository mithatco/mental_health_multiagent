Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health across different domains. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one at a time. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like, and we can take breaks if needed. Let's start with the first question. I. Mood 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
