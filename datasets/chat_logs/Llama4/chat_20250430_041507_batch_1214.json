This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The therapist directly linked the patient's symptoms, such as 'feelings of anxiety' and 'avoidance behaviors,' to the DSM-5 criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder, providing a clear and justified diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, expressing understanding and support. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling like they're 'just going through the motions,' the therapist responded with empathy, saying, 'I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you work through these challenges.'"
