For example, when the patient reported 'sometimes it feels like it would just be easier if I wasn't here anymore,' the therapist immediately followed up on this suicidal ideation. All domains, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, cognitive function, and others, were thoroughly explored.",

The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology.

The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, effectively building on the patient's disclosures. For example, after the patient mentioned feeling 'on edge all the time,' the therapist logically followed up with questions about anxiety and worry, demonstrating a smooth transition and understanding of the patient's symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, hopelessness, and lack of interest in activities. The justification was comprehensive, and the diagnosis was directly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style, maintaining an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, when the patient expressed feelings of hopelessness, the therapist provided a supportive and non-judgmental response, demonstrating warmth and understanding."
