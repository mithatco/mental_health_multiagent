Alternative diagnoses were implicitly ruled out by the absence of symptoms like hallucinations or delusions.",

      "predicted": "The patient presents with a complex array of symptoms that suggest significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. <quote>I've been feeling really disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting as it used to. I've been going through the motions, but it's hard to find the energy or excitement in activities</quote>. This disconnection and lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, coupled with <sym>persistent sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, are concerning for <med>depressive disorders</med>. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>memory problems</sym>, which further underscore the complexity of their mental health challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>diminished ability to think or concentrate</sym>, and <sym>recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation</sym> (without a plan) support this diagnosis. The co-occurrence of <sym>anxiety</sym> suggests <med>anxious distress</med> as a specifier. The absence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> or <sym>delusions</sym> helps to rule out more severe <med>psychotic disorders</med>. \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation, including a detailed psychiatric interview, physical examination, and possibly laboratory tests, to rule out other medical conditions that could be contributing to symptoms.\n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consideration of antidepressant medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) or <med>SNRI</med> (e.g., venlafaxine), to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Initiation of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Education on <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to help manage <sym>insomnia</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. **Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
