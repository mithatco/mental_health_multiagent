Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, Q2).\n- Anxiety and fear of panic attacks (Q6, Q7).\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8).\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14).\n- Physical symptoms during panic attacks (Q9).\n- Suicidal ideation without a plan (Q11).\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n- Feelings of detachment and loss of identity (Q18, Q19).\n- Social withdrawal and relationship difficulties (Q20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and fear, particularly related to panic attacks.\n- Depressive symptoms, including loss of interest in activities and feelings of hopelessness.\n- Significant impairment in social and occupational functioning due to anxiety and avoidance behaviors.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having panic attacks, and avoidance of situations due to fear of panic.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Possible given the physical symptoms during panic attacks and feelings of detachment, though specific trauma is not mentioned.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry and anxiety about various things.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11) without a plan, indicating a need for careful assessment and management of suicide risk.\n- Substance use disorders: Denied (Q21, Q22, Q23), which is positive but should be monitored.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, notably panic disorder and symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation, although without a plan, necessitates immediate attention. The patient's significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning underscore the need for comprehensive treatment planning. Key areas for intervention include management of panic attacks, depressive symptoms, improvement of sleep quality, and enhancement of coping strategies. The patient's report of feeling misunderstood (Q10) highlights the importance of a supportive therapeutic relationship. Overall, a multifaceted treatment approach addressing both depressive and anxiety disorders, with careful monitoring of suicide risk, is warranted.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of distress, feeling disconnected from things that used to bring you joy, and struggling with <sym>persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>. You described living with a constant sense of anxiety and fear of having <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which significantly impacts your daily life and relationships. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and that they've been affecting your sleep, social interactions, and overall well-being. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and feelings of detachment from yourself and others are particularly concerning and suggest a need for comprehensive support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with both <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med> given the recurrent panic attacks and persistent worry about having future attacks, and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to the <sym>persistent feelings of sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan necessitates careful management. The combination of these symptoms significantly impairs daily functioning and warrants a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <quote>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</quote> to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and to develop coping strategies.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as <med>SSRIs</med> (e.g., fluoxetine) or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term relief of <sym>panic symptoms</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Development of a <quote>safety plan</quote> to manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure support systems are in place.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices and potentially <med>sleep aids</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
