This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

But sometimes I feel like I'm just not sure what's the point of it all.\") suggests some level of suicidal ideation or ambivalence about life.\n2. **Substance use**: The patient's use of marijuana (Q23) and history of smoking (Q22) may indicate substance use or nicotine dependence.\n\n**Clinical Summary:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity, which may indicate co-occurring mental health conditions. The patient's mood instability, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties suggest a complex clinical presentation. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use are notable risk factors that require careful assessment and intervention. Further evaluation and diagnostic assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.",
