For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the patient reported sleeping a lot, and the therapist did not probe further. Additionally, some questions could have been rephrased to better match DSM-5 language, but overall, the questions were clinically relevant.",

The therapist also could have provided more explicit links to DSM-5 criteria.",

However, there were moments where the therapist's responses seemed somewhat formulaic or lacking in emotional depth.

The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>fear</sym> you're experiencing in social situations, along with your avoidance of these situations, are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, but the broader pattern of symptoms points more towards <med>GAD</med>. The <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> you reported, such as feeling down and hopeless, suggest a co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. Your <sym>cognitive symptoms</sym>, such as intrusive thoughts and forgetfulness, are also consistent with these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview and physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and to develop coping strategies for managing stress.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as an SSRI, to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Development of a self-care plan, including stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation, to help you manage your symptoms.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed.",
