Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment consists of 23 questions and will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen and support you through this process. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, with reports of nervousness, worry, and panic. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties are notable, and the patient reports feelings of detachment and suicidal ideation.
