      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and frustration in social situations, which can be really overwhelming for you. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and enjoying hobbies and spending time with close friends, but feeling anxious in big gatherings or parties. You also shared that you get <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>irritated</sym> in uncomfortable situations, and that <quote>\"it's like my heart is racing and I worry about saying something wrong\"</quote>. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient reports feeling <sym>nervous</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>frightened</sym> in social situations, particularly when they are the center of attention or have to interact with people they don't know well. They also report avoiding social situations that make them anxious and experiencing anxiety-related physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and stomach aches. Additionally, the patient's intrusive thoughts and rumination about social interactions are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. While the patient also reports some depressive symptoms, they do not appear to be severe or persistent enough to warrant a separate diagnosis of a <med>depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations that trigger anxiety.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, if deemed necessary.",
