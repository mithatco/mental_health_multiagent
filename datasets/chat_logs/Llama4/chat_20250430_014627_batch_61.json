Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety and depression. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Anxiety:** Persistent worry, feeling on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.\n- **Depression:** Feelings of hopelessness, depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, and irritability.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts and anxiety.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains, particularly in the shoulders, neck, and digestive issues.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Endorses thoughts of hurting themselves when feeling overwhelmed by anxiety.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Depression Overlap:** The patient exhibits a significant overlap between anxiety and depressive symptoms, suggesting a possible mood disorder with anxious distress.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Avoids social and crowded situations due to anxiety.\n- **Repetitive Behaviors:** Exhibits compulsive behaviors such as repeatedly checking locks.\n- **Dissociation:** Occasionally feels detached from themselves and their surroundings.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms align with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder, given the panic attacks and persistent worry.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressive symptoms such as loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep and energy.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Repetitive thoughts and compulsions to check locks.\n- **Dissociative Symptoms:** Indicates possible dissociative disorder or symptom severity related to stress.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient endorses thoughts of self-harm, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies using substances to cope, but the absence of coping mechanisms might increase vulnerability.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with **mixed depressive and anxiety symptoms**, meeting criteria for further evaluation for Major Depressive Disorder and an Anxiety Disorder. The presence of **suicidal ideation** necessitates immediate risk assessment and safety planning. Compulsive behaviors and dissociative symptoms suggest possible co-occurring OCD or dissociative disorder. Physical symptoms and sleep disturbances further underscore the clinical significance of anxiety. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and consideration of treatment options, including therapy and medication, are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- 296.32 Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, with anxious distress\n- 300.02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- 301.81 Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (for compulsive behaviors)\n- 308.0 Acute Stress Disorder (for dissociative symptoms)\n\n**Immediate Actions:**\n- Assess suicide risk and develop a safety plan.\n- Consider referral for psychotherapy (CBT, DBT) and psychiatric evaluation for medication.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that <quote>\"this constant cloud of worry and sadness [is] following me around.\"</quote> It's clear that these feelings are overwhelming and impact your daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. Your descriptions of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>physical tension</sym> highlight the severity of your distress. I'm here to support you in exploring these challenges and finding ways to improve your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> you experience daily, along with <sym>panic attacks</sym>, suggest <med>anxious distress</med> as a specifier for MDD. Additionally, your <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (e.g., repeatedly checking locks) and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> (feeling detached) may indicate co-occurring conditions such as <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> or a <med>dissociative disorder</med>, but these require further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Suicide Risk Assessment and Safety Planning:** Given your <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it's crucial to assess your risk level and develop a safety plan to ensure your immediate well-being.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n3. **Psychiatric Evaluation:** A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for potential medication to manage <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Coping Mechanisms:** Explore healthy coping strategies, such as mindfulness, exercise, or creative activities, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. **Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up sessions to monitor your progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
