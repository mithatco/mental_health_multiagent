However, it may suggest the need for:\n\n1. **Establishing a rapport**: Building a therapeutic relationship to encourage patient engagement and disclosure.\n2. **Alternative assessment methods**: Considering alternative assessment approaches, such as observational or collateral data, to gather more information.\n\n**Summary of Observations:** The patient's failure to provide responses to the questionnaire suggests a need for further evaluation to determine the underlying reasons for this non-engagement. The clinical team should consider strategies to establish a rapport and explore alternative assessment methods to gather relevant information. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan may be warranted to address potential underlying concerns.",

The therapist's conclusion that 'no diagnosis can be made' is justified, but the reasoning provided speculates about potential underlying issues without concrete evidence from the conversation.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrates empathy and a professional tone, acknowledging the patient's struggle to express thoughts and feelings. The response, 'It takes courage to seek help, and I'm here to support you,' shows understanding and support. However, the overall interaction is somewhat limited by the lack of specific patient responses."
