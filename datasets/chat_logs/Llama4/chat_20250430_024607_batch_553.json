          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports experiencing significant mood variability, with periods of low interest/pleasure (Q1), feeling down/depressed/hopeless (Q2), irritability (Q3), and anxiety (Q6). They also describe sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14), engaging in risky behaviors (Q5), and experiencing panic (Q7). Additionally, they mention physical symptoms such as aches and pains (Q9) and memory problems (Q15). The patient also expresses feelings of being a burden and having thoughts about not wanting to be around anymore (Q11).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Mood Swings:** The patient describes significant mood swings, oscillating between high energy/ideas and low motivation/depression. This pattern suggests possible bipolar-like symptoms.\n- **Anxiety and Stress:** Anxiety and stress appear to exacerbate symptoms, contributing to sleep disturbances, irritability, and physical complaints.\n- **Impulsivity:** The patient admits to engaging in risky behaviors and making impulsive decisions, which could indicate issues with impulse control.\n- **Self-Perception and Relationships:** The patient struggles with identity (Q19) and feels disconnected from others (Q20), indicating possible issues with self-esteem and interpersonal relationships.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Mood Disorders:** The patient's reports of depressive episodes, periods of high energy, and irritability suggest a possible mood disorder, such as Bipolar Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder with possible manic/hypomanic features.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms of anxiety (Q6, Q7, Q8) and avoidance behaviors indicate a potential anxiety disorder.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient does not indicate a significant problem with prescription medication misuse (Q23), recreational substance use might be a concern, particularly if used as a coping mechanism.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The presence of thoughts about not wanting to be around anymore (Q11) is a significant concern and indicates a need for immediate risk assessment.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation (Q11):** The patient reports thoughts about not wanting to be around anymore, which is a clear warning sign for suicide risk.\n- **Substance Use (Q23):** While not at a level indicating dependence, recreational use could pose risks, especially if used to cope with mental health symptoms.\n- **Impulsivity and Risky Behaviors (Q5):** These behaviors could lead to physical or psychological harm.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with complex symptomatology suggestive of a mood disorder, possible anxiety disorder, and issues related to impulsivity and substance use. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment and immediate intervention. The patient's reports of significant distress, mood variability, and functional impairment highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a tailored treatment plan. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Bipolar I or II Disorder\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Anxiety Disorder (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder)\n- Substance Use Disorder (depending on further evaluation of substance use patterns)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a detailed diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., mood disorder questionnaires, anxiety scales) to clarify the diagnosis.\n- Assess suicide risk thoroughly and develop a safety plan.\n- Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation if warranted.\n- Initiate therapy (e.g., CBT, DBT) to address symptoms and coping strategies.",
