This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one question at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their responses suggest a complex clinical presentation, potentially involving multiple diagnoses, including Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and impulse control issues. The patient's suicidal ideation and substance use are notable risk factors that require immediate attention and further assessment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address these concerns.",
