Depressed mood (Q2: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless)\n2. Anhedonia (Q1: little interest or pleasure in doing things)\n3. Sleep disturbances (Q4: sleeping less than usual, Q14: problems with sleep affecting overall quality)\n4. Anxiety (Q6: feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge)\n5.
