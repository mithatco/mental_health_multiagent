The therapist did not ask any questions related to the patient's symptoms or mental health status, and therefore, did not have any clinically relevant or accurate interactions.

The conversation abruptly stopped due to technical errors without any meaningful interaction. This results in a score of 1 for consistency and logical flow.",

The technical errors prevented any interaction, and therefore, no diagnostic considerations were discussed or justified. This results in a score of 1 for diagnostic justification and explainability.",

The lack of engagement means there were no opportunities to demonstrate empathy or a professional tone. This results in a score of 1 for empathy, naturalness, and professionalism."
