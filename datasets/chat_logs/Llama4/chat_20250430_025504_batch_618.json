Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. This comprehensive coverage justifies a score of 5.",

For example, when asking about substance use, the therapist could have been more precise in defining 'medicines on your own.' However, the questions were largely clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts, and ensured a coherent conversational arc. The conversation had smooth transitions and was well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors, to justify the diagnoses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance. Overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and showed concern for the patient's well-being."
