You're also experiencing anxiety, worry, and fear, which is affecting your daily life and relationships. Your sleep is disrupted, and you're waking up early, feeling exhausted. You're not sure who you are or what you want out of life, and you're feeling disconnected from others. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> (provisional), and <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests anxious distress. The patient's reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> are consistent with <med>Insomnia Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>physical symptoms</sym>, such as back pain and headaches, may be related to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, although this diagnosis requires further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess the patient's symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider referring the patient to a therapist for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Discuss <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or sleep aids, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to track their sleep patterns and identify potential triggers.\n5. Explore <med>mindfulness-based stress reduction</med> techniques to help the patient cope with anxiety and stress.",
