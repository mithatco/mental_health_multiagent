The patient's report of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by a plan, warrants further assessment and monitoring. The patient's sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties may be related to their depressive and anxiety symptoms. Overall, the patient's responses suggest a need for further evaluation and potential treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n* Social Anxiety Disorder\n* Insomnia or Sleep Disturbance\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Further evaluation and diagnostic assessment to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses.\n* Development of a treatment plan to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties.\n* Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and risk factors.",
