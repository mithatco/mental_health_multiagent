This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your well-being and identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and we'll go through them one by one. I'm ready to begin with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
