You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, like a heavy cloud is following you around. You also mentioned feeling irritable, anxious, and on edge, with panic attacks that feel like you're going to die. Your sleep is messed up, and you have nightmares. You're avoiding certain situations that make you anxious, like driving. You feel detached from yourself, others, and activities you used to enjoy. You even mentioned that sometimes it feels like it would be easier if you weren't here. <quote>I've been feeling pretty disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote>\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> due to the presence of <sym>nightmares</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (e.g., driving), and <sym>hyperarousal symptoms</sym> (e.g., feeling on edge, irritability). The patient's history of a traumatic event (implied, not directly stated) and current symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> also support a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's substance use (Q21) may be a coping mechanism for their symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a more in-depth diagnostic interview to confirm clinical impressions and assess for trauma history.\n2. Develop a treatment plan addressing <med>PTSD</med> symptoms, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and trauma-focused interventions.\n3. Address <med>MDD</med> symptoms with medication and/or therapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and interpersonal therapy (IPT).\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a sleep diary to monitor sleep patterns and identify strategies to improve sleep quality.\n5. Explore alternative coping mechanisms for anxiety and stress, such as mindfulness, exercise, or creative activities.\n6. Consider referral to a specialist (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist) for further evaluation and treatment.",
