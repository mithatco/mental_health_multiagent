Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your symptoms. This is a comprehensive assessment that will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
