Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a tool to help identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless about the future. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, and you've been having trouble sleeping and experiencing nightmares. You also shared that you've been feeling like you're constantly on edge and worried about something bad happening. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> due to the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts/images</sym> (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (Q6). Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>\"feelings of hopelessness\"</quote> and <quote>\"not knowing who I really am or what I want out of life\"</quote> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. <med>Trauma-focused CBT</med> to address <sym>PTSD symptoms</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts/images</sym>.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
