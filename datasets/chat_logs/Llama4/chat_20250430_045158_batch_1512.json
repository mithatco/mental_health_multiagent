However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly moved to a new topic without fully exploring the patient's previous disclosure (e.g., the patient's report of 'drinking more than I should' was not thoroughly addressed).

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses were not thoroughly discussed or ruled out.
