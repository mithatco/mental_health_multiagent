For example, question 5 was phrased as 'Starting lots more projects than usual or doing more risky things than usual?' which might not directly align with the DSM-5 criteria for mania. However, the therapist attempted to use clinically relevant language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies, such as abrupt transitions between topics (e.g., moving from discussing sleep to hearing voices). The therapist mostly maintained a coherent conversational arc but could improve on smoother transitions.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as hearing voices (A12), feeling like people can read their mind (A13), and experiencing unpleasant thoughts (A16). The justification was clinically sound and comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style. However, there were moments where the therapist seemed to focus more on the technical aspects of the assessment rather than fully acknowledging the patient's distress. For example, when the patient mentioned suicidal ideation, the therapist could have provided more immediate empathy and support."
