The patient's reports of suicidal ideation and potential substance use issues raise concerns for immediate risk assessment and intervention. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the presence of specific mental health conditions and to develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Immediate risk assessment and intervention for suicidal ideation.\n* Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders.\n* Exploration of potential trauma or stress-related disorders.\n* Assessment of substance use patterns and potential related issues.\n* Development of a treatment plan addressing the patient's identified symptoms and concerns.",
