      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which are affecting your daily life. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not enjoying things as much as you used to. You also shared that you're on edge a lot, worried about making mistakes, and scared that something bad will happen. It's clear that these feelings are overwhelming and impacting your relationships and overall well-being. <quote>\"I feel like there's a cloud over me, and I don't know how to shake it off.\"</quote> It's completely understandable to feel this way, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest co-occurring <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depressive</med> disorders. Your reported <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> (Q6-Q7), as well as avoidance behaviors (Q8), are indicative of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), decreased interest in activities (Q1), and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) meet criteria for a <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (Q17) may also suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. In-depth diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and identify any underlying causes.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med>, to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Development of coping mechanisms and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
