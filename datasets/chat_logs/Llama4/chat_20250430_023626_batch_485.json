The patient's reported symptoms and concerns suggest potential diagnoses, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. The patient's sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and physical symptoms further contribute to their overall distress. Notably, the patient's suicidal ideation and increased alcohol consumption raise concerns for risk factors that warrant immediate attention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address the patient's multifaceted needs.\n\n**Future Assessment and Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n* Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying causes of the patient's symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan\n* A thorough trauma assessment is warranted to understand the impact of the reported accident on the patient's mental health\n* Consideration of evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and trauma-focused CBT, may be beneficial in addressing the patient's symptoms and concerns.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a profound sense of disconnection from things that used to bring you joy, and that <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> has become a frequent companion for you. You described it as a <quote>weight on my chest</quote>, which suggests a deep emotional pain. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>nightmares</sym> are affecting your overall well-being, and it's understandable that you'd feel <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> much of the time. I'm here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with those characteristic of <med>PTSD</med>, particularly given your reported accident and the associated <sym>flashbacks</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. The <sym>hypervigilance</sym> and <sym>exaggerated startle response</sym> you mentioned also support this diagnosis. Additionally, your <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> are common comorbidities with <med>PTSD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (<med>TFCBT</med>):** This therapy approach can help you process and cope with the traumatic experience.\n2. **Medication:** Consider <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNIRIs</med> to manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Practices:** Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. **Support Groups:** Joining a support group for individuals with <med>PTSD</med> may provide a sense of community and understanding.\n5. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
