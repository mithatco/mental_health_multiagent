Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'hearing voices,' the therapist probed further to understand the nature and impact of these hallucinations. Similarly, the therapist adequately explored depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and other key domains.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and were phrased in clinically accurate ways. The language used was clear and aligned with clinical terminology, ensuring that the patient's symptoms were accurately captured. For instance, when assessing for psychotic symptoms, the therapist used specific language from the DSM-5, such as 'hearing voices that others couldn't hear.' This precision helped in making a well-informed diagnosis.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. When the patient disclosed sensitive information, such as thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist responded with empathy and explored these concerns thoroughly. The conversation was well-structured and easy to follow.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizophrenia was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which included hallucinations (hearing voices), disorganized thinking (feeling like others can hear their thoughts), and negative symptoms (lack of interest in activities, feeling down). The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to the DSM-5 criteria for Schizophrenia, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the diagnostic guidelines. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was transparent and clinically sound.",
