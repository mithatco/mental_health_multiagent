Your sleep is disrupted, and you're feeling <sym>irritated</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> much of the time. You're also experiencing <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, including memory fogginess and disorientation. It's clear that you're in significant distress and are struggling to cope with daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14). Co-occurring <med>anxiety</med> symptoms (Q6, Q7) and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) suggest a diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>hearing whispers</sym> (Q12) and feeling like others can read their mind (Q13) indicate potential <med>psychotic symptoms</med>. The combination of these symptoms warrants a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.

Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or antianxiety medications, to alleviate <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3.
