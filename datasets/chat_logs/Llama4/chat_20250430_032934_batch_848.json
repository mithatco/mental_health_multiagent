However, the questions were mostly relevant and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",

The therapist effectively linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, demonstrating a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing 'suicidal thoughts,' the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, the therapist generally maintained a warm and professional tone."
