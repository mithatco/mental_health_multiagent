Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1), feelings of hopelessness and being down (Q2), and decreased energy levels (Q4).\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent worry (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Trouble sleeping due to a racing mind and not feeling rested (Q4, Q14).\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains, particularly in the shoulders, neck, and stomach issues (Q9).\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** Difficulty concentrating, memory issues when anxious, and intrusive thoughts (Q15, Q16).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Depression:** The patient\u2019s responses suggest a strong interplay between anxiety and depressive symptoms. Anxiety seems to exacerbate depressive feelings and vice versa.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** A pattern of avoidance of social and possibly other situations due to anxiety (Q8).\n- **Self-Perception:** The patient feels disconnected from themselves and others, indicating possible identity or self-concept issues (Q18, Q19, Q20).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Significant symptoms of depression (Q1, Q2).\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry and anxiety (Q6).\n- **Panic Disorder:** Experiences panic attacks (Q7).\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Avoidance of situations due to anxiety (Q8).\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Reports of sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14).\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient mentions feeling overwhelmed but does not have specific thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11).\n- **Substance Use:** Past attempts at self-medication with alcohol or marijuana, which worsened symptoms (Q21, Q23).\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and possible major depressive disorder. Sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and physical symptoms further complicate the clinical picture. The patient reports a sense of disconnection from themselves and others, suggesting potential identity issues. While there are no active suicidal ideations, the patient has a history of self-medication, which could be a risk factor. Comprehensive assessment and intervention are warranted to address these multifaceted symptoms and concerns.\n\n**DSM-5 Diagnosis Considerations:** Depressive Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, and Sleep-Wake Disorders should be evaluated further. \n\n**Treatment Recommendations:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication for depression and anxiety, and sleep hygiene practices could be beneficial. \n\n**Follow-Up:** Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and substance use.",

The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> manifests as <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>aches and pains</sym>. They also describe <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and cognitive issues like <sym>memory problems</sym> when anxious. The patient's attempts to cope, including past <quote>\"self-medication\"</quote> with substances, have not been effective and may have worsened their condition.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med>. The <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as lack of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep and energy levels are consistent with <med>MDD</med>. The persistent worry, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and avoidance behaviors support a diagnosis of <med>GAD</med>.
