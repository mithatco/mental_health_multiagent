        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder generally aligns with the patient's reported symptoms, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, irritability, and psychotic symptoms. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnosis, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, there was minor ambiguity in the justification, as some alternative diagnoses were not thoroughly ruled out or discussed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with appropriate professional tone. However, there were a few moments where the therapist's language seemed slightly formal or technical, which may have come across as somewhat impersonal. Overall, the therapist demonstrated a good understanding of the patient's emotional state and responded accordingly."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing the patient's mental health using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist effectively explored all 23 dimensions, and the dialogue flowed logically. While there were minor issues with clinical relevance and diagnostic justification, the overall performance was strong. With some refinement in these areas, the therapist could achieve exceptional performance across all criteria.",
