These symptoms align with criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n2. **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences anxiety (Q6), panic (Q7), and avoidance of situations that make them anxious (Q8), suggesting the presence of an anxiety disorder.\n3. **Sleep Disturbance:** Reports of sleeping less but not having energy (Q4) and overall poor sleep quality (Q14) indicate significant sleep disturbances.\n4. **Cognitive and Emotional Functioning:** The patient reports problems with memory and concentration (Q15), feelings of detachment (Q18), and uncertainty about their identity and life goals (Q19).\n\n**Patterns in Responses:**\n- **Mood and Affective Symptoms:** Prominent depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Social withdrawal and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.\n- **Self-Perception:** Negative self-view, feelings of being a burden, and low self-worth.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt.\n2. **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety Disorder, or Panic Disorder, given the symptoms of anxiety, panic, and avoidance.\n3. **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Insomnia Disorder, given the difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts about not wanting to be here (Q11), indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies use of illicit substances or misuse of prescription medications (Q21-23), reducing the likelihood of substance-related factors contributing to symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments, suggesting a complex clinical picture likely involving mood and anxiety disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment and development of a safety plan.
