We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> for periods of time. You've also mentioned experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, which can be really tough to deal with. It's clear that you're facing some significant challenges, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to not be okay.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Recurrent</med>. Your experiences of feeling <quote>like I'm going through the motions</quote> and <quote>like I'm watching myself from outside my body</quote> suggest a sense of detachment and disconnection, which can be common in depressive disorders. Additionally, your <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> are significant risk factors that require immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Complete a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and identify any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Administer additional assessment tools, such as the <med>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale</med>, to assess suicidal risk.\n3. Consider consulting with a psychiatrist for medication evaluation, as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> may be helpful in managing symptoms.\n4. Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns, emotional regulation, and coping skills.\n5. Develop a safety plan to mitigate suicidal risk, including crisis intervention and support.\n6. Encourage healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise, balanced diet, and stress management techniques, to support overall mental health.",
