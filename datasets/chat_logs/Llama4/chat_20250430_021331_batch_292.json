          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant distress across several domains, with prominent symptoms including:\n\n* Depressed mood (Q2: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless)\n* Anxious distress (Q6: feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge)\n* Loss of interest (Q1: little interest or pleasure in doing things)\n* Irritability (Q3: feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual)\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14: sleeping less due to racing thoughts and poor sleep quality)\n* Somatic symptoms (Q9: unexplained aches and pains)\n* Suicidal ideation (Q11: thoughts of actually hurting yourself, though not a clear plan)\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n* **Anxiety and worry:** The patient consistently reports high levels of anxiety (Q6, Q7, Q8), describing a pervasive sense of worry and fear.\n* **Depressive symptoms:** Depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness are recurrent themes (Q1, Q2, Q19).\n* **Self-doubt and uncertainty:** The patient expresses uncertainty about their identity, desires, and future (Q19: not knowing who you really are or what you want out of life).\n* **Interpersonal difficulties:** The patient reports strained relationships due to their irritability and anxiety (Q3, Q20).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, and associated symptoms (Q1, Q2) suggest potential MDD.\n* **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurring anxiety, panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) indicate possible anxiety disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder).\n* **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14) may meet criteria for insomnia or anxiety-related sleep disorders.\n* **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** The patient reports multiple unexplained physical complaints (Q9).\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n* **Suicidal ideation (Q11):** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves without a clear plan, indicating a need for further assessment and safety planning.\n* **Substance use (Q21-23):** While the patient denies current substance use, past attempts at self-medication with alcohol or marijuana suggest potential substance use disorder.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant distress across multiple domains, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints. Suicidal ideation without a clear plan is noted, necessitating further assessment and safety planning. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Sleep-Wake Disorders. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan addressing these areas are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n* Panic Disorder\n* Insomnia Disorder\n* Somatic Symptom Disorder\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm or rule out suspected diagnoses.\n* Assess for suicidal risk and develop a safety plan.\n* Consider referral for further evaluation or therapy.",
