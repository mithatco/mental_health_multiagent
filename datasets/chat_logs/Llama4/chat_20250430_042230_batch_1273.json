This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from more precise language.",

The reasoning behind each diagnosis was sound and clinically appropriate.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with an appropriate professional tone. However, there were a few moments where the therapist could have been more empathetic, such as when the patient discussed feelings of hopelessness. A more personalized and emotionally engaged response could have enhanced the therapeutic connection."
