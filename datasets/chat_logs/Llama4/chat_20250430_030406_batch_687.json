      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions, with periods of high motivation and interest in life, followed by episodes of feeling hopeless and depressed. <quote>It's like my mood swings are all over the place</quote>. It's clear that these mood swings have been impacting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. You've also shared that you've had thoughts about death and not wanting to be here anymore, which is really concerning and requires immediate attention. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and we'll work together to develop a plan to help you manage these symptoms and improve your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms, including <sym>mood swings</sym>, <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, suggest a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The fact that you experience periods of high energy and motivation, followed by episodes of depression, is consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> may be symptoms of this condition. While you also report <sym>substance use</sym>, it appears to be recreational and not necessarily a primary driver of your symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist or a mental health professional to address your <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a crisis plan.\n2. Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> to help manage your <sym>mood swings</sym> and <sym>depressive episodes</sym>.\n3. Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to develop coping skills and strategies for managing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. Practice self-care techniques, such as mindfulness, exercise, and relaxation, to help regulate your mood and reduce <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Consider a <med>substance use assessment</med> to evaluate your recreational substance use and determine if it's contributing to your symptoms.",
