It's hard to shake them off.\"</quote>. You're also experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which can be really scary. It sounds like you're having trouble sleeping, and your mind keeps racing.

Your reports of <sym>feeling down</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>irritable</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>repetitive thoughts and behaviors</sym>, are consistent with these diagnoses. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further supports the possibility of an <med>anxiety disorder</med>. Your <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and <sym>behaviors</sym> might indicate <med>OCD</med>, but more information is needed to confirm this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnoses and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>OCD symptoms</sym>.\n3.

Development of coping strategies and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, relaxation, or journaling, to help regulate emotions and reduce <sym>symptoms</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
