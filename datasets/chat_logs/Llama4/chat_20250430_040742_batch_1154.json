Their reports of emotional distress, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbances suggest significant impairment in daily functioning.

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and that there's a cloud over you that you can't shake off. It's clear that you're experiencing significant distress and impairment in your daily life. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of recurrent, intrusive thoughts (Q16) and compulsive behaviors (Q17) are characteristic of <med>OCD</med>. Their reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2) and lack of interest in activities (Q1) suggest <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, their symptoms of anxiety (Q6), worry (Q6), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) are consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The patient's responses indicate a complex clinical profile that warrants a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the presence of <med>OCD</med>, <med>MDD</med>, and <med>GAD</med>.\n2. Consideration of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or medication (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) to address <med>OCD</med> and <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n3. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation, to help alleviate <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and make adjustments as needed.\n5. Consideration of additional therapies, such as exposure and response prevention (ERP) for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.",
