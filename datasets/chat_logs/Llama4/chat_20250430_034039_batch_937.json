You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying life as much as you used to. You also expressed concerns about being judged or saying something wrong, which leads to <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and causing significant distress. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of excessive worry, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>GAD</med>. Additionally, your reported <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and decreased interest in activities, suggest <med>MDD</med>. The presence of both anxiety and depressive symptoms warrants consideration of comorbid diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Further evaluation: Schedule a follow-up appointment to conduct a more in-depth diagnostic interview and gather additional information to confirm these impressions.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>: Consider referring you to a therapist who can help you address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and develop coping strategies for managing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med>: Depending on the outcome of the further evaluation, medication may be considered to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage stress-reducing activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n5. Regular check-ins: Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
