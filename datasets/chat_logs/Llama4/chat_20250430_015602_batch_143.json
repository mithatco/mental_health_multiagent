You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and that a \"cloud is following you around.\" <quote>It's like I'm going through the motions</quote>. You're also experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry, and it's hard for you to relax. You've had thoughts of panic and feeling like you're losing control. Additionally, you've reported some pretty distressing symptoms like hearing voices and feeling like people can see inside your head. It's clear that you're going through a really tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Psychotic Features</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile. The endorsement of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, such as hearing voices and feeling like thoughts are being broadcast, suggests <med>psychotic features</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are indicative of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's sleep disturbances, including <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>excessive daytime sleepiness</sym>, meet criteria for a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms, as well as sleep disturbances.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as antidepressants or antipsychotics, to manage symptoms.\n4. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy, to address underlying issues and develop coping strategies.\n5. Lifestyle modifications, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule, engaging in physical activity, and practicing relaxation techniques, to help manage symptoms.\n6. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
