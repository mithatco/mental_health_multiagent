You mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and that you've lost interest in things you used to enjoy. <quote>It's like I'm going through the motions</quote>. Your sleep has been affected, and you're experiencing anxiety and irritability. You also mentioned some unsettling experiences, such as hearing voices and feeling like people can see what you're thinking. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, provisional.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, characterized by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The patient's responses to the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult suggest a high level of distress and impairment. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> could be considered, the symptoms presented do not clearly warrant this diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the presence and severity of specific mental health conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic interview and mental status examination.\n2. Consider a <med>psychological assessment</med> to evaluate cognitive function, emotional regulation, and coping mechanisms.\n3. Develop a <med>personalized treatment plan</med> that addresses depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, potentially incorporating <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, <med>medication</med>, and <med>lifestyle modifications</med>.\n4. Explore <med>stress management techniques</med>, such as mindfulness and relaxation, to help manage anxiety and improve overall well-being.\n5. Consider <med>referral to a specialist</med>, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, for further evaluation and treatment.",
