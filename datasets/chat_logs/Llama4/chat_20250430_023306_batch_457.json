The assessment we're about to do is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Your responses will help us understand your current state and what support you might need. Are you ready to begin?"

I just feel like things would be better if I wasn't here, sometimes.\") suggests passive suicidal ideation, which requires careful assessment and monitoring.\n2. **Functional Impairment:** The patient's symptoms are impacting their daily life, including their relationships, work, and overall well-being.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. The patient's responses suggest significant distress and impairment in various domains of functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation and functional impairment highlights the need for careful assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling to find joy in things you used to love, feeling empty and down, and experiencing a constant sadness that affects your daily life. <quote>It's like I'm just going through the motions</quote>. You're also dealing with a lot of anxiety, worry, and fear, which makes you avoid social situations and feel like you're on edge all the time. Additionally, you're experiencing chronic pain, physical fatigue, and sleep disturbances. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope and feeling overwhelmed. I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep and appetite</sym>, and <sym>physical fatigue</sym>, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>fear</sym> also suggest <med>anxious distress</med> as a specifier. Furthermore, the patient's <sym>chronic pain</sym> and <sym>physical complaints</sym> may indicate <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam and lab tests, to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Pain management strategies, such as medication or physical therapy, to address chronic pain.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices and relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness or deep breathing, to improve sleep quality.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
