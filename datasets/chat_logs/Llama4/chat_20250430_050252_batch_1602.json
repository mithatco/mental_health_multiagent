We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The <quote>\"cloud\"</quote> you've described feeling over you all the time, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident, are consistent with <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling disconnected from activities and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. Your <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> also support a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a licensed therapist to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3.
