Their recent divorce appears to have triggered a significant decline in their mental health, with reports of negative affect, interpersonal sensitivity, and somatic complaints. The patient's suicidal ideation and social isolation are concerning and warrant immediate attention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan are necessary to address these clinical concerns.",
