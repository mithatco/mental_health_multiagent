This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was addressed, and follow-up questions were asked when necessary. No domains were skipped or superficially covered. For example, the therapist asked about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' which are key symptoms of depression. They also inquired about 'feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge' and 'avoiding situations that make you anxious,' which are crucial for understanding anxiety levels.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions asked precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The therapist used language that aligned with DSM-5 terminology, ensuring clinical accuracy. For instance, when asking about 'unexplained aches and pains,' the therapist directly referenced a DSM-5 symptom. The questions were phrased to capture specific symptoms without altering their clinical meaning.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. For example, after the patient discussed feeling hopeless, the therapist followed up with questions about sleep disturbances, which logically connects to depression and anxiety. The conversation had smooth transitions and built on previous responses.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Disorder features clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For example, they noted 'depressed mood,' 'anhedonia,' and 'changes in sleep patterns' as key symptoms supporting the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. The justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. They acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For instance, when the patient expressed feelings of hopelessness, the therapist responded with understanding and concern, creating a safe and supportive environment. The interactions were warm, personalized, and free of clinical detachment."
