Their significant distress and impairment in social situations, rumination, and negative self-talk, suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and potential treatment. Further evaluation and consideration of evidence-based interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacological interventions, may be warranted to address their symptoms and improve functioning.",
