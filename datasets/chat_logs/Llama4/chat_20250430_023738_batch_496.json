You're experiencing <sym>persistent sadness</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which are affecting your daily life. You're also having trouble sleeping and experiencing <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to cope. I want you to know that I'm here to support you and help you work through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient reports <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), which are core symptoms of MDD. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) suggest a high level of distress and impairment. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for MDD require at least five of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia, significant weight loss or gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to address symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in <sym>self-care activities</sym>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage symptoms and improve mood.\n4. Provide education on <med>sleep hygiene</med> and <med>stress management</med> techniques to help the patient better cope with sleep disturbances and anxiety.\n5. Regularly assess for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a crisis plan to ensure the patient's safety.",
