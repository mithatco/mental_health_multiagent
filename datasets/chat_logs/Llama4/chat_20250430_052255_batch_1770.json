Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'm ready to begin with the first question.

All domains were covered, but the question about 'starting lots more projects than usual or doing more risky things than usual' was not fully explored in the context of mania. The therapist could have probed deeper into this area to better understand the patient's behavior. However, the conversation did touch on relevant areas such as depression, anxiety, and substance use.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'but still have a lot of energy' to better capture the manic symptom. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the right symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few moments where the therapist could have followed up more extensively. For instance, when the patient mentioned 'unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images that repeatedly enter your mind,' the therapist could have explored this further to understand the nature and frequency of these thoughts. Despite this, the conversation maintained a coherent structure.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety and substance use specifiers. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was explicitly stated and aligned with the patient's reported symptoms. However, the therapist could have considered alternative diagnoses or provided more detailed differential diagnosis consideration. The justification was sound but could have been more comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, when the patient expressed feelings of disconnection, the therapist responded with understanding. The only area for improvement was in consistently validating the patient's emotions throughout the conversation."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong effort to cover DSM-5 dimensions and address clinical symptoms.
