You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a weight that feels hard to shake off. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're experiencing fatigue. You're also dealing with anxiety, feeling on edge, and worrying about things that might not even happen. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your relationships and daily life. <quote>\"Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here\"</quote> suggests that you're experiencing significant distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15, Q16). The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7, Q8) suggests anxious distress, which is a specifier for MDD. The patient's <quote>\"feelings of emptiness\"</quote> and <quote>\"it's like I'm going through the motions\"</quote> also support this diagnosis. The reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) indicates a need for immediate risk assessment and management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm MDD and rule out other conditions.\n2. Assess and manage <sym>suicidal risk</sym> by developing a safety plan.\n3. Consider <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Evaluate the need for <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and anxiety.",
