The patient's reports of psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and thought interference, warrant further evaluation. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use behaviors also raises concerns for risk management. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should be developed to address these clinical concerns.",

        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with psychotic features and anxiety symptoms were clearly justified by the patient's symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific DSM-5 criteria and patient responses, demonstrating a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",

For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's distress."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided a clear justification for the diagnoses. While there were minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was strong.",
