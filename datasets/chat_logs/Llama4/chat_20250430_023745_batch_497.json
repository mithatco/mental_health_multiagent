      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of disconnection from things you used to enjoy, and experiencing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like feeling down and hopeless. You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>frightened</sym> a lot, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance of situations that make you anxious. Additionally, you've been having trouble sleeping due to worries and <sym>physical tension</sym>. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and scared, and it's affecting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest co-occurring <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>. The <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> you've reported could be indicative of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>physical complaints</sym> may be related to your anxiety and depressive symptoms. As you said, \"<quote>I feel lost sometimes. I don't know what I want or who I am outside of my routines and worries.</quote>\"\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and to rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym>, and to develop coping strategies for managing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. Consideration of medication to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n4. Development of a self-care plan to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>physical tension</sym>, such as regular exercise, mindfulness practices, and relaxation techniques.",
