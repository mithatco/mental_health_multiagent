The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for MDD include a depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, which aligns with the patient's reported symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough safety assessment to address the patient's reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their immediate safety.\n2.
