I'm going to use a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to help us have this conversation. This questionnaire is designed to help identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next little while, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to take your time to answer each one. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use (although occasional) necessitates careful assessment and treatment planning. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and consideration of evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, are warranted to address the patient's symptoms and concerns. Close monitoring of suicidal risk and regular follow-up appointments are essential to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",
