Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking each one in turn. Your responses will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen without judgment, and I'm ready to begin with the first question. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling like you're going through the motions, but not really feeling excited or interested in activities. <quote>It's like everything feels flat</quote>. I can imagine how difficult and isolating this must be for you. You've also shared that you've been experiencing anxiety, worry, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to cope with these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, and <med>insomnia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses suggest a pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1, Q2), which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient also reports <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> (Q6, Q7, Q8), which are common comorbidities with MDD. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) increases the risk and severity of the depressive episode. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15) further support the diagnosis of MDD. The anxious distress is evident in the patient's reports of feeling <quote>nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge</quote> (Q6).\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. In-depth assessment of depressive and anxiety symptoms using standardized measures, such as the <med>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</med> and the <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific needs, including <med>pharmacological interventions</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) and <med>psychotherapeutic approaches</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy).\n3. Sleep hygiene practices and <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, treatment response, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consideration of <med>crisis intervention</med> and <med>suicidal risk management</med> given the patient's reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.",
