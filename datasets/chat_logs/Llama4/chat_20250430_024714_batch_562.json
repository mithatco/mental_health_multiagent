The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "content": "Honestly, I've been feeling a bit disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's not that I don't want to do them, but when I think about doing them, I get really anxious. Like, the thought of going to a party or even just going to the grocery store feels overwhelming lately."
