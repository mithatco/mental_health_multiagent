This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

These symptoms significantly impact daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. The patient's reports of suicidal ideation and consideration of substance use are notable risk factors that require careful assessment and management.
