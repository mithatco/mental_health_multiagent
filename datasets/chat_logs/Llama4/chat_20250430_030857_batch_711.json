This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Their anxiety appears to be linked to social situations and avoidance behaviors. While depressive symptoms are not pervasive, they may indicate a risk for depressive disorders. The patient's sleep disturbances and somatic complaints may be related to stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Further assessment and exploration of these symptoms are necessary to determine the presence of specific mental health conditions.

Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from more precise language in a few instances.",

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, including a discussion of differential diagnoses and specific DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal.

You've also mentioned having trouble sleeping and feeling tired, which can be really frustrating. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and it's affecting your daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of feeling nervous, anxious, and frightened, particularly in social situations, along with avoidance behaviors, suggest a potential <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The <quote>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> and <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> indicate possible <med>depressive symptoms</med>, but they don't seem to be pervasive enough to warrant a separate depressive disorder diagnosis. Your sleep disturbances and somatic complaints may be related to stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to further assess your symptoms and determine the best course of treatment.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n3. Develop a <med>sleep hygiene</med> plan to improve sleep quality.\n4. Explore <med>relaxation techniques</med>, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, to help manage anxiety and stress.\n5. Consider a <med>psychological assessment</med> to evaluate for potential underlying issues contributing to your symptoms.",
