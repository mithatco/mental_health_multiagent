You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a sense of frustration and anxiety that's affecting your daily life. <quote>It's like nothing seems as interesting or fun anymore. I've been going through the motions, but it's all felt pretty empty.</quote> It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress specifier</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests an anxious distress specifier. The patient's responses also indicate <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (although no plan is present), which require careful assessment and monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess and monitor symptoms, including suicidal ideation.\n2. Consider initiating <med>pharmacological treatment</med> with an antidepressant medication, such as an SSRI or SNRI, to address depressive symptoms.\n3. Develop a <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> plan to address negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and enhance problem-solving abilities.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>stress-reducing activities</med>, such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation, to help manage anxiety and improve overall well-being.\n5. Refer the patient to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address sleep disturbances and develop strategies for improving sleep quality.",
