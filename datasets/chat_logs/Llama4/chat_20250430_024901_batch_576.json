I've also noticed that you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be really challenging to manage.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress\n\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and lack of interest in activities meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, avoidance behaviors, and panic episodes also suggest a high level of anxious distress. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for <med>MDD</med> require at least five symptoms, including <sym>depressed mood</sym> or <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities. The patient's responses indicate that they are experiencing several of these symptoms, making <med>MDD</med> a likely diagnosis.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to keep a <med>sleep diary</med> to track their sleep patterns and identify potential <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to improve sleep quality.\n4. Consider <med>mindfulness-based interventions</med> to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and make adjustments as needed.",
