Additionally, the patient reports occasional depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints. The patient's responses indicate a need for further evaluation and potential treatment for anxiety and/or depressive disorders.

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and worrying about what others think of you. <quote>it's like, my mind goes blank, and I worry that people are judging me</quote>. It's clear that these experiences are distressing and impact your daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I appreciate your courage in sharing these concerns with me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and responses suggest a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient reports <sym>excessive anxiety and fear in social situations</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>significant distress</sym> in these situations. Specifically, the patient mentions feeling <quote>nervous or anxious pretty often, especially in social situations or when I'm going to be the center of attention</quote> (Q6). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as <quote>headaches or stomachaches when I'm really anxious about something</quote> (Q9). These symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> as outlined in the DSM-5.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>maladaptive behaviors</sym> contributing to social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym> in social situations.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> as adjunctive treatment for <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, if deemed necessary.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, provide support, and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
