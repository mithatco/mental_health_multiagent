The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic decision to specific DSM-5 criteria, citing depressed mood, anhedonia, psychotic-like experiences, anxiety, and irritability. The reasoning provided is clinically sound and comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor instances where the responses seemed somewhat formulaic or lacked emotional depth. For example, when the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance or explored this concern in greater depth. Overall, the interaction was professional and supportive."

While there are minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance is excellent.
