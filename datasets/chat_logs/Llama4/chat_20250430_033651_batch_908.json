Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a confidential and safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The recent \"big change\" may be a contributing factor to the patient's current mental health concerns. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and significant distress underscores the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of an effective treatment plan to address the patient's immediate needs and long-term well-being.",
