The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, effectively exploring symptoms and concerns. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, indicating strong consistency and logical flow.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which included depressive, anxious, and psychotic symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic decision to specific DSM-5 criteria and patient responses. The reasoning provided was sound, comprehensive, and well-supported by the conversation content.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. However, there were minor moments where the therapist's responses seemed slightly formulaic or impersonal. Overall, the interaction was warm and supportive, but could have benefited from even more personalized and emotionally nuanced responses."

The therapist effectively covered all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided a well-justified diagnosis. While minor areas for improvement exist, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was excellent.",

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that things that used to interest you don't seem as appealing anymore. <quote>\"It's like I'm just going through the motions.\"</quote> It's clear that you're experiencing significant distress and impairment in your daily life. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizoaffective Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, characterized by co-occurring <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms.

Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough assessment by a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Medication: Antipsychotic medication to manage <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and <sym>mood stabilizers</sym> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n3. Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to address <sym>emotional regulation</sym> and coping skills.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage healthy habits, such as regular exercise, balanced diet, and stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, relaxation).\n5. Ongoing monitoring: Regular check-ins with a mental health professional to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide support.",
