However, it may suggest the need for a more sensitive or supportive approach to engage the patient in the assessment process.\n\n**Summary of Observations:** The patient's failure to provide responses to all questionnaire items precludes a comprehensive symptom-based assessment. The non-response pattern warrants further exploration and may necessitate a modified or alternative assessment approach to engage the patient and gather relevant clinical information. A thorough clinical interview and/or observation may be necessary to establish a rapport and gather more information about the patient's mental health status. \n\n**Recommendations:** A follow-up appointment or session may be necessary to re-administer the questionnaire or utilize alternative assessment methods to gather more information about the patient's symptoms, concerns, and mental health status. A collaborative and empathetic approach may help establish trust and facilitate a more accurate assessment.",
