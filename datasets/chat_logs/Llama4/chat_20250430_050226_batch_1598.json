We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The therapist explored depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. This comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's mental health.",

The questions were phrased in clinically accurate ways, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria.",

The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to the diagnostic criteria, such as 'flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts related to a traumatic event' for PTSD and 'depressed mood, loss of interest, and changes in sleep and energy' for MDD.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, expressed understanding, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For example, the therapist stated, 'I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that I'm taking your concerns seriously,' demonstrating warmth and empathy."
