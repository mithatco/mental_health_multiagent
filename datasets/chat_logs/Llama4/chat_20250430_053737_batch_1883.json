The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like. Let's begin with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (A1, A2).\n- Increased irritability and anger (A3).\n- Significant sleep disturbances, characterized by excessive sleeping (A4).\n- Anxious feelings and worry about various aspects of life (A6).\n- Panic-like episodes (A7).\n- Avoidance of social situations due to anxiety (A8).\n- Unexplained physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches (A9).\n- Feelings of hopelessness and occasional thoughts of wishing to disappear (A11).\n- Cognitive difficulties, including trouble concentrating and memory issues (A15).\n- Recurring, intrusive thoughts (A16).\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of negative affect, including depression, anxiety, and irritability.\n- Significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n- Physical symptoms that could be somatic manifestations of stress or anxiety.\n- Avoidance behaviors, particularly in social contexts.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Loss of interest, depressed mood, changes in sleep, feelings of hopelessness, and decreased energy.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Excessive worry, panic-like episodes, and avoidance of social situations.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** Concentration and memory problems.\n- **Psychological Distress:** Feelings of detachment, not knowing one's identity, and decreased enjoyment in relationships.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation, albeit passive, expressed as wishing to disappear (A11).\n- Significant distress and impairment in daily life, social relationships, and work.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture suggestive of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Depressive symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in appetite (not directly reported but inferred through lack of interest in activities), sleep disturbances, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt (inferred through irritability and self-criticism), diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Anxiety symptoms manifest as excessive worry, restlessness, feeling on edge, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors. The presence of significant distress, impairment in functioning, and risk factors (notably passive suicidal ideation) underscores the need for a comprehensive treatment plan. Further evaluation, including a detailed diagnostic interview and possibly additional assessments, is warranted to confirm these impressions and guide treatment.",

I know others have it worse, but it still feels weird that I'm not excited about things I used to love.\"</quote> It's clear that you're finding it tough to cope with daily life, feeling overwhelmed by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Your <quote>\"moments where my heart starts racing and I feel like I'm going to lose control\"</quote> sound incredibly frightening. It's understandable that you're avoiding social situations due to <sym>anxiety</sym> and feeling like you've <quote>\"become a different person\"</quote>. \n\n**Diagnosis:** \n*MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder)*\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym> or guilt, <sym>diminished ability to think or concentrate</sym>, and <sym>recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation</sym> (albeit passive) are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. Simultaneously, the <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>restlessness</sym>, <sym>feeling on edge</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> point towards <med>GAD</med>. The presence of both <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med> suggests a possible comorbid condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. **In-depth Diagnostic Interview:** Conduct a comprehensive interview to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any other potential conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressants</med> (e.g., SSRIs) or <med>anxiolytics</med> to manage symptoms.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep quality</sym> and establishing a regular sleep schedule.\n5. **Coping Mechanisms:** Teach <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n6. **Regular Follow-ups:** Schedule regular appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
