It's like the excitement's gone, and I feel meh about everything.\"</quote> Your situation, compounded by a recent divorce, seems to be weighing heavily on you, affecting not just your mood but also your relationships and daily functioning. It's clear that you're finding it challenging to cope with these changes and are seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), as indicated by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, changes in appetite or sleep (<sym>hypersomnia</sym>), <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>difficulties with concentration</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness or guilt</sym> (inferred from <quote>\"I feel like I'm stuck in this rut and can't get out.\"</quote>). The presence of <sym>recurrent thoughts</sym> about past relationships and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (<quote>\"sometimes I feel like I just want it all to stop.\"</quote>) further supports this diagnosis. While anxiety symptoms are prominent, they appear to be part of the clinical presentation of MDD rather than a separate anxiety disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n2. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including emergency contact numbers and a safe environment plan.\n4. Encourage <med>social support</med> through group therapy or support groups to help the patient reconnect with others and build coping strategies.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
