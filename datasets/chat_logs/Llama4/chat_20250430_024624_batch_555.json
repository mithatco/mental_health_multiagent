This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and progress. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
