Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Each question was asked and explored with the patient, covering all relevant domains including depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. The therapist demonstrated thoroughness in assessing the patient's symptoms across various domains.",

However, there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise or detailed. For example, when asking about substance use, the therapist could have provided more context or specified types of substances. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from slight improvements in specificity.",

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing differential diagnoses or explicitly ruling out other potential conditions. The reasoning provided was clinically sound but could have benefited from additional detail.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their emotions. However, there were moments where the interactions seemed slightly formal or could have been more personalized. For example, when the patient discussed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance or support."
