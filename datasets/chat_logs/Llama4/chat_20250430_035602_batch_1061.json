The patient's <sym>repetitive thoughts and behaviors</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are also consistent with <med>anxiety disorders</med>. The <sym>physical symptoms</sym>, such as tension and stomachaches, could be related to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but the primary symptoms appear to be anxiety and depression.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Further evaluation and assessment to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3.
