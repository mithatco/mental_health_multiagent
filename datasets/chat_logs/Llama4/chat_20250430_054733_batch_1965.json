Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** Using substances without a prescription increases the risk of developing a substance use disorder and may complicate treatment.\n- **Severe Mental Health Symptoms:** The combination of depressive, anxiety, and substance use symptoms suggests a complex clinical presentation requiring careful assessment and management.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by significant depressive symptoms, pronounced anxiety, including panic attacks, and substance use as a coping mechanism. The presence of suicidal ideation, dissociative symptoms, and interpersonal difficulties further underscores the need for a comprehensive and integrated treatment plan.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling with a lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and experiencing anxiety and irritability. You've shared that it's like you're just going through the motions, and a cloud of sadness follows you around. You've also talked about feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, and having panic attacks that feel terrifying. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with daily life, and you're using substances without a prescription to try and manage your stress and anxiety. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you without judgment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (<sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym>, <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym>), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (<sym>feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>), and <sym>substance use</sym> as a coping mechanism. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> further supports the need for a comprehensive diagnosis. The patient's reports of <quote>\"going through the motions\"</quote> and feeling like a <quote>\"cloud is following me around\"</quote> suggest a pervasive mood disorder. The <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> indicate an anxiety disorder. The use of substances without a prescription to cope with stress and anxiety points towards a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnoses of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage the patient in therapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med>, to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Substance Use Counseling:** Provide counseling on <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment options, including <med>detoxification</med>, <med>rehabilitation</med>, and <med>support groups</med>.\n5. **Crisis Intervention:** Develop a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n6. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
