It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> Your days are filled with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about various aspects of life, from your job to your relationships. You're also experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are affecting your overall well-being. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings, and at times, you're worried about your own safety. <quote>Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here.</quote>\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with <med>Anxiety</med> features, and <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests that <med>Anxiety</med> features are also present. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> meet criteria for a <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms and their impact on daily functioning supports these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview and physical examination to rule out underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Initiate treatment with <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety</med> features.\n3. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices and <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment response and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. Consideration of <med>emergency psychiatric services</med> if <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> increases or if the patient is in immediate danger.",
