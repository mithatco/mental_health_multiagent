For example, when asking about substance use, the therapist could have used more specific language related to the types of substances and frequency of use.",

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses, such as Bipolar Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder, and discussing the role of substance use in the patient's symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions felt slightly robotic or impersonal.
