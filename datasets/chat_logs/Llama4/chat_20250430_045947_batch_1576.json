The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of questions, 23 in total, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's negative affect, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints suggest a range of potential diagnoses, including Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation and occasional substance use (wine) highlights the need for further assessment and safety planning.

You mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and it's hard to explain, but it's affecting your daily life. You also shared that you're experiencing anxiety, feeling on edge, and having trouble sleeping. It's clear that you're going through a tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> (Q1), <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic</sym> (Q7), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) suggest anxious distress. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) also warrants consideration.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, potentially including <med>pharmacotherapy</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med>.\n3. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address the patient's depressive symptoms and anxious distress.\n4. <quote>\"Safety planning\"</quote> to address the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
