Their reports of sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, and suicidal ideation (albeit without a strong intent to act) warrant further evaluation. The patient's avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations and compulsive behaviors may be indicative of underlying anxiety and OCD symptoms.

You're also experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive thoughts that you can't seem to shake off. It's like your mind is racing, and you feel detached from others and yourself at times. You expressed feelings of hopelessness and thoughts that you shouldn't be here, but you don't think you'd act on them. Your sleep is affected, and you have some physical complaints like back pain.
