Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a tool to help identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
