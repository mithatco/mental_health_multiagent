This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions together. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that you avoid parties and gatherings because they make you uncomfortable. <quote>I'm not really into big crowds</quote>. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and causing you distress. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and behaviors align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, as evidenced by their <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> due to <sym>fear of being judged or evaluated</sym> (Q8, Q6). Additionally, their reports of <sym>nervousness, anxiety, and fear</sym> in social situations (Q6, Q7) and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about being judged or saying something wrong (Q16) support this diagnosis. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> (Q9) may also be related to their anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety and stress</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for symptom management, under the guidance of a mental health professional.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
