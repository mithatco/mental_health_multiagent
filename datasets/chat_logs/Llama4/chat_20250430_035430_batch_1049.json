Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've described feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, with a cloud over you that you can't shake off. You've also been experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and irritability, which have affected your relationships and daily life. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>low energy</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that are really upsetting. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q1), and <sym>low energy</sym> (Q4) align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) suggest <med>anxious distress</med> as a specifier. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without a plan warrants close monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic interview and <med>psychological assessment</med> to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n3. Develop a <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> plan to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Encourage <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage stress and improve mood.\n5. Monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a crisis plan to ensure the patient's safety.",
