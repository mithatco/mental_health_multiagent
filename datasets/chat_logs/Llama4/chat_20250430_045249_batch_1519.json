This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and guide our conversation. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses, such as Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder, and providing a more detailed differential diagnosis.",

The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, used a professional tone, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. The conversation felt warm and personalized, with no instances of clinical detachment or overly technical language."

The therapist covered all dimensions, displayed empathy, and maintained a logical flow. However, minor areas for improvement exist, particularly in ensuring precise clinical language and providing a comprehensive differential diagnosis.",
