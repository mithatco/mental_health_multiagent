This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "content": "Hmm, I'd say I still find some pleasure in things, but it's been harder to enjoy them lately. I feel like I'm just going through the motions most of the time, and even things I used to love don't bring me as much joy as they used to. It's like I'm just too worried about everything else to really engage."

You're also experiencing physical symptoms like tension, aches, and pains, which are likely related to your anxiety. <sym>Anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> are impacting your relationships, sleep, and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>GAD</med> due to excessive worry, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors (Q6, Q7, Q8). Their <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2) and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2) suggest <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> (Q9) are likely related to their anxiety and depression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>GAD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications) to address symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to practice <med>relaxation techniques</med> (e.g., deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) to manage anxiety.\n4.
