The patient's avoidance behaviors and physical symptoms during panic attacks suggest a possible anxiety disorder. The patient's reports of hopelessness and despair, as well as their desire to find relief from their symptoms, highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a lot of distress, feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and struggling with <sym>panic attacks</sym> that leave you feeling hopeless and on edge. It's clear that these episodes are significantly impacting your daily life, causing you to avoid certain situations and withdraw from social interactions. Your reports of <sym>chest pain</sym>, <sym>shortness of breath</sym>, and <sym>heart palpitations</sym> during these attacks are particularly distressing. <quote>\"It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen. Even little things can set me off.\"</quote> This hypervigilance and fear of having another attack are taking a toll on your mental and physical well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \nPanic Disorder with Agoraphobia\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, persistent concern or worry about having more attacks, and significant maladaptive behavioral changes related to the attacks, such as avoidance of places or situations where escape might be difficult. The presence of <sym>agoraphobia</sym> is indicated by the patient's avoidance of situations or places due to fear of having a panic attack. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and fear of panic attacks have led to significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically <med>panic control treatment</med> and <med>cognitive restructuring</med>, to help manage symptoms of panic and agoraphobia.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term relief, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n3. Lifestyle modifications, including regular <med>exercise</med>, <med>mindfulness</med>, and <med>stress management</med> techniques to help reduce overall anxiety levels.\n4. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out other mental health conditions, such as <med>major depressive disorder</med> or <med>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med>, given the patient's reported symptoms.\n5. Consideration of <med>exposure therapy</med> to help the patient gradually confront feared situations and reduce avoidance behaviors.",
