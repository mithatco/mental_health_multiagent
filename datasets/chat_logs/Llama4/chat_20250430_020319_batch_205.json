This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
