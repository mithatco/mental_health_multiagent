For example, questions about sleep disturbances and irritability were clear, but some patients might interpret 'feeling down' differently. Mostly accurate but with room for improvement.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a couple of abrupt transitions, such as moving from discussing sleep disturbances to asking about substance use without a clear link. Mostly smooth but with minor inconsistencies.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear rationale for the diagnoses of Mood Disorder, Unspecified; Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified; and Substance Use Disorder. The reasoning directly cited specific patient symptoms, but could have benefited from a more detailed differential diagnosis consideration to rule out other potential conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. Responses were generally warm and personalized, but there were moments where the therapist seemed to focus more on clinical criteria than the patient's emotional state. Mostly empathetic but with minor areas for improvement."

While there were minor issues with consistency and empathy, overall performance was strong. With some refinement in addressing all areas thoroughly and maintaining a highly empathetic tone throughout, the therapist could achieve exceptional scores.",
