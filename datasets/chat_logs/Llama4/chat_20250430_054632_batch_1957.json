          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms across several domains:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms**: Little interest or pleasure in doing things (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and thoughts about death or suicidal ideation without intent (Q11).\n- **Anxiety Symptoms**: Feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge (Q6), panic or being frightened (Q7), and avoiding situations that make the patient anxious (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: Sleeping less than usual but having a lot of energy (Q4), problems with sleep affecting overall sleep quality (Q14).\n- **Impulsivity and Risk-taking**: Starting lots of projects but struggling to finish them (Q5), making impulsive decisions (e.g., buying a car on a whim), and substance use (Q21, Q23).\n- **Physical Symptoms**: Unexplained aches and pains (Q9).\n- **Cognitive Symptoms**: Problems with memory (Q15), intrusive thoughts (Q16), and feeling detached from oneself or surroundings (Q18).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Mood Swings**: The patient describes experiencing significant mood swings, with periods of feeling down and hopeless, and other times feeling highly motivated but also irritable and impulsive.\n- **Substance Use**: Reports of alcohol use and use of prescription medications or other substances without a doctor's prescription, particularly during manic phases.\n- **Interpersonal Relationships**: Difficulty maintaining relationships due to mood swings and impulsivity.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Recurrent depressive episodes, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of death.\n- **Anxiety Disorders**: Significant anxiety, worry, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Bipolar Spectrum Disorder**: Symptoms suggestive of manic and depressive episodes, including increased energy, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors.\n- **Substance Use Disorder**: Use of substances in greater amounts or longer than intended.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: Thoughts about death and a desire for the pain to stop, though without a clear intent to act.\n- **Impulsive and Risky Behaviors**: Indicates potential for harm to self or others.\n- **Substance Use**: Increases the risk of overdose, accidents, and worsening of psychiatric symptoms.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture suggestive of a mood disorder, likely within the bipolar spectrum, given the reported manic and depressive episodes. Anxiety symptoms and substance use are also significant concerns. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent requires careful assessment and management. The patient's pattern of impulsive behaviors, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties further supports the need for a comprehensive treatment plan addressing mood stabilization, anxiety management, sleep hygiene, and substance use cessation. Collaboration with other healthcare professionals and consideration of both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n\n- Bipolar I or II Disorder\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Anxiety Disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder)\n- Substance Use Disorders\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Further evaluation, including a detailed diagnostic interview and possibly additional assessments (e.g., mood disorder rating scales).\n- Development of a crisis plan given the presence of suicidal ideation.\n- Coordination of care with other healthcare providers as necessary.\n\nThis summary provides a clinical overview based on the patient's self-reported symptoms and experiences. A comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan require a thorough clinical evaluation, including additional diagnostic interviews and assessments.",
