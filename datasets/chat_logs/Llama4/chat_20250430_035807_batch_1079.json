You've shared that you've been feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and that <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> have been creeping in. You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>irritated</sym>, which can be really tough to navigate. It's clear that you're struggling to find your footing, and that these emotions are impacting your daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I'll do my best to help you make sense of what's going on.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Sleep Disturbances</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with <sym>fluctuating mood</sym>, <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>emotional dysregulation</sym> also point towards a <med>mood disorder</med> diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym> raise concerns that need to be addressed. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> could be considered, it's not clear that the symptoms meet the full criteria.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>emotional regulation</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n4. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure your safety.\n5. Consider <med>medication</med> to help manage <sym>mood symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.",
