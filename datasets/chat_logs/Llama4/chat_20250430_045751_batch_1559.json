This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as honest as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

These symptoms align with criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\n2. **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences anxiety (Q6), feelings of being on edge (Q6), and panic (Q7), which suggest the presence of an anxiety disorder.\n3. **Sleep Disturbance:** The patient reports poor sleep quality (Q14), early morning wakefulness, and difficulty falling back asleep, which can be associated with both depressive and anxiety disorders.\n4. **Cognitive Impairment:** The patient notes problems with memory (Q15) and learning new information, which could be related to depression, anxiety, or other underlying conditions.\n\n**Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- **Emotional Distress:** The patient consistently reports feelings of disconnection, hopelessness, and anxiety, suggesting significant emotional distress.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** The patient avoids social situations (Q8) and reports feeling distant from others (Q20), indicating social withdrawal.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** The patient experiences unexplained aches and pains (Q9), which can be associated with both depression and anxiety.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt.\n2. **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms of anxiety, panic, and avoidance behaviors.\n3. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, feelings of detachment and avoidance could suggest trauma; further exploration is warranted.\n4. **Substance Use:** While the patient denies significant substance use, monitoring is recommended.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n1. **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves without a plan (Q11), indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n2. **Social Isolation:** Avoidance of social situations and feeling distant from others could exacerbate symptoms.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, along with sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and social withdrawal. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan necessitates urgent attention to safety planning. Comprehensive assessment and potential referral for further psychiatric evaluation are warranted to address these clinical concerns. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n- Anxiety Disorder (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder)\n- Possible PTSD or trauma-related disorders (given avoidance and detachment symptoms)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Safety Planning:** Develop a safety plan given the patient's suicidal ideation.\n2. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., trauma-focused) to clarify diagnoses.\n3. **Referral:** Consider referral to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation and a therapist for psychotherapy.",
