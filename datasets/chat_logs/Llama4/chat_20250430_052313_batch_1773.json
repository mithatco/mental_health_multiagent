You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and that a cloud of sadness follows you around, making you feel hopeless about the future. <quote>I've been feeling pretty disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> It's clear that this has been a really tough time for you, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex presentation of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> following a traumatic event (the accident). The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are characteristic of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>persistent feelings of sadness</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The co-occurrence of these conditions is not uncommon, and a comprehensive treatment plan should address both diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med> and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates evidence-based therapies for <med>PTSD</med>, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and trauma-focused CBT.\n3. Consider pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address symptoms of <med>MDD</med> and <med>PTSD</med>.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a sleep diary to monitor sleep patterns and identify potential triggers for <sym>insomnia</sym>.\n5. Offer coping skills and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> symptoms.",
