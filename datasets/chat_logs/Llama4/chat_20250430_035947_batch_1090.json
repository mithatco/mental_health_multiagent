The assessment we're about to do is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I mean, I go through the motions, but nothing really brings me joy like it used to. It's been like this for a while now, especially since... you know, the accident."

Sometimes it gets really bad, and I just feel like I'm going through the motions of life without any real purpose."
