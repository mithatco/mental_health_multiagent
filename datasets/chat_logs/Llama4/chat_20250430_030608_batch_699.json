Your descriptions paint a picture of significant distress and impairment in daily life, with <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> being particularly prominent. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope and are looking for support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms and potential <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are characteristic of <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> also supports a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <quote>hearing voices</quote> and <quote>feeling like others can hear thoughts</quote> suggest potential <med>Psychotic Symptoms</med>, which require further evaluation. The complexity of symptoms and their impact on daily life necessitate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and physical examination to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Administer standardized measures of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms to track symptom severity and monitor treatment response.\n3. Develop a treatment plan that integrates pharmacotherapy (e.g., antidepressants, antianxiety medications) with psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, <med>CBT</med>).\n4. Explore <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia</med> (<med>CBT-I</med>) to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Consider <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> to help the patient process and cope with <quote>trauma or stress-related symptoms</quote>.\n6.
