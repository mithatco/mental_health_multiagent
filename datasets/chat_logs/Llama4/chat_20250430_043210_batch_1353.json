You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and there's a cloud of sadness following you around. <quote>it's like this cloud follows me around, making everything feel heavier</quote>. You're also experiencing a lot of anxiety, feeling like you're constantly on edge, and having panic attacks. It sounds incredibly tough to deal with these <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> on a daily basis. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are affecting your overall well-being, and you're trying to cope with <sym>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</sym> that are intrusive and distressing.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses indicate a pattern of <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q16, Q17), which are characteristic of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7) further supports the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam, psychological questionnaires, and a thorough medical and mental health history, to confirm the diagnoses and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms, and <med>pharmacotherapy</med> (e.g., antidepressants) to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track their <sym>mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>OCD</sym> symptoms, which can help identify patterns and triggers.\n4. Consider <med>mindfulness-based stress reduction</med> techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
