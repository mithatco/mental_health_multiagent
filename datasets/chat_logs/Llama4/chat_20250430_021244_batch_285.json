The patient's reports of suicidal ideation, emotional distress, and cognitive impairments highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and immediate attention to safety concerns. Further assessment and potential referral to specialized care (e.g., psychotherapy, medication evaluation) are warranted to address these clinical concerns.",
