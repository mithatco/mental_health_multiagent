I'm going to administer the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

It's clear that you're carrying a significant emotional burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>PTSD</med> due to the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> (Q6, Q7) following a traumatic event (the accident). Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> (Q4, Q14) are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's increased alcohol use (Q21) may be a coping mechanism for these symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Trauma-Informed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** This therapy approach can help you process and cope with the traumatic event and reduce symptoms of <med>PTSD</med>.\n2. **Pharmacological Interventions:** Consideration of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be warranted to help manage symptoms of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Practices:** Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine may help improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Substance Use Counseling:** Addressing increased alcohol use through counseling or support groups can help mitigate potential risks and improve overall well-being.\n5. **Support System:** Encouraging the patient to reconnect with friends and family or join a support group for trauma survivors may help alleviate <sym>feelings of isolation</sym>.",
