Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in activities\n- Increased irritability and anger\n- Anxiety and worry\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Cognitive impairments (concentration, memory)\n- Feelings of hopelessness and detachment\n- Suicidal ideation (passive)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- Pervasive negative affect (depressed mood, irritability, anxiety)\n- Significant impairment in functioning (social withdrawal, decreased motivation)\n- Predominance of internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression) over externalizing behaviors\n- Reports of physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches) potentially related to stress\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and energy, feelings of hopelessness, and concentration problems.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Possible given the recent divorce and reports of intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment.\n- **Adjustment Disorder:** Significant distress following a major life change (divorce).\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation (passive): \"I'm not sure... I mean, I feel like I just want to escape sometimes, but I don't know if I'd really do anything to hurt myself.\"\n- Social isolation and withdrawal\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and adjustment-related symptoms. The recent divorce appears to be a significant precipitating factor. The patient's report of passive suicidal ideation necessitates careful assessment and monitoring. The presence of sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, and physical symptoms further underscores the severity of the patient's mental health concerns. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a tailored treatment plan are warranted to address these multifaceted needs. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic interview\n- Consideration of standardized measures for depression, anxiety, and PTSD\n- Development of a crisis plan given the presence of passive suicidal ideation\n- Potential therapeutic modalities: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and/or pharmacological interventions.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're going through an incredibly tough time, especially after your divorce. You mentioned feeling <sym>down and depressed</sym>, and it's clear that you're struggling with <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> you used to enjoy. Your feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> are understandable given the challenges you're facing. It's heartbreaking to hear about your <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are clearly impacting your daily life. Your concerns about feeling <sym>detached</sym> from yourself and others are also valid. As you said, <quote>\"I just feel so overwhelmed and unsure about my future.\"</quote>.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>, and <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>.\n\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, changes in <sym>sleep</sym> and <sym>energy</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about various aspects of life, along with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The recent divorce triggering these symptoms points towards <med>Adjustment Disorder</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although passive, necessitates careful consideration.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n2. Explore <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to help cope with the emotional aftermath of the divorce.\n3. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> given the presence of <sym>passive suicidal ideation</sym>.\n4. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n5. Encourage <sym>social support</sym> through reconnecting with friends and family or joining a support group.\n6. Implement <med>stress management techniques</med> such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.",
