For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance and support."

The conversation was logical, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound.

The symptoms described, such as hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and cognitive difficulties, are consistent with schizophrenia.
