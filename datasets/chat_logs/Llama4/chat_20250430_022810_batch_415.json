The recent accident appears to be a significant stressor contributing to the patient's current mental health concerns. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as a coping mechanism raises concerns about the patient's immediate risk and potential for long-term mental health challenges. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan addressing these concerns are warranted.",

Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>PTSD</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n3.
