This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as honest as possible. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a deep sense of disconnection and hopelessness, feeling like you're just going through the motions of daily life without much joy or purpose. You mentioned that things that used to bring you pleasure no longer seem interesting, and you're often feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. These feelings are weighing heavily on you, making everyday tasks feel overwhelming. It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of emotional pain and distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15) are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7, Q8) and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2, Q11) further support this diagnosis. While you also report some <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, they appear to be secondary to your depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Consideration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. <med>Psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and enhance relationships.\n4. Development of a <med>safety plan</med> to address suicidal ideation, including regular check-ins and crisis intervention.\n5. Encouragement of <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.",
