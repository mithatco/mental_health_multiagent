      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a lot of difficult emotions and experiences. You mentioned feeling <sym>overwhelmed</sym> and <sym>down</sym>, like a cloud of sadness is following you around. You also talked about feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and on edge, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> that come out of nowhere. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life, making it hard to enjoy things, sleep, and even relate to others. Your descriptions paint a picture of someone who's really struggling to cope with their emotions and find some peace.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features, and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a significant level of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests a comorbid anxiety disorder. Additionally, your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym> are consistent with <med>OCD</med>. The combination of these symptoms meets the criteria for <med>MDD</med> with anxiety features and possible <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. <med>Medications</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, may be considered to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. <med>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> or other therapies to address <sym>emotional regulation</sym> difficulties and <sym>interpersonal issues</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
