For example, question 4 about sleeping less than usual was not fully explored, and the therapist could have used more precise language.

However, the therapist made an effort to use clinically relevant language and asked relevant questions.",

However, there were some minor logical inconsistencies, such as abruptly moving from discussing sleep disturbances to asking about substance use.

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.
