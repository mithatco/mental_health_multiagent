Depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and anxiety-related physical symptoms are also reported. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the presence and severity of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's reports of feeling detached or distant from themselves and others (Q18) and struggling to connect with people (Q20) may indicate additional areas of concern. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and consideration of evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacological interventions, may be warranted.",

The recommended treatment options, such as CBT, exposure therapy, and pharmacological interventions, are also consistent with social anxiety treatment. However, the diagnosis also mentions 'Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder' which might not be directly related to social anxiety, but the primary focus seems to be on anxiety and social situations.",
