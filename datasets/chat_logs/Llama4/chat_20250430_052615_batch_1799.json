The assessment we're going to do today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I used to love hiking, but now it feels like just another thing to worry about, like 'what if I get lost?' or 'what if the weather is bad?' It's hard to find pleasure in things when my mind is racing all the time."

I worry about my job, my health, my family... it feels like there's always something. Sometimes it feels like I'm just barely keeping my head above water.
