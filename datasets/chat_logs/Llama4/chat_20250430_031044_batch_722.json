The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can share your thoughts and feelings. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
