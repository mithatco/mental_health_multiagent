You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and experiencing a \"cloud\" of sadness that you can't shake off <quote>It's like there's this cloud over me, and I don't know how to shake it off</quote>. Your anxiety and worry about making mistakes or things being okay are overwhelming, and you're trying to cope with these feelings.

The presence of recurrent, unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors, such as checking locks or washing hands excessively, suggests <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, your reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and experiencing changes in sleep patterns, may indicate <med>MDD</med>. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>OCD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Consider <sym>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</sym>, specifically <sym>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</sym> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Explore <sym>medication options</sym> with a psychiatrist, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4.
