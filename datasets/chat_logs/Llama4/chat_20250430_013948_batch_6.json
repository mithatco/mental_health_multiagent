Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand your mental health across various domains. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one at a time. Please feel free to express yourself in as much detail as you like. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist systematically addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other key domains thoroughly.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about substance use, the therapist could have been more specific about the types of substances and frequency of use. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and panic attacks, and ensured a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) clearly aligns with the patient's symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep patterns, and fatigue. However, the therapist could have provided more explicit consideration of alternative diagnoses and more detailed justification for ruling out other potential conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and tailored responses to their emotional state."
