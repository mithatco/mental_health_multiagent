      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with some really tough stuff. You mentioned having these <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that you just can't shake off, and they're affecting your daily life. You feel <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> a lot, and you're having trouble sleeping. You're also experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. It's clear that you're trying to cope with all of this, but it's impacting your relationships and overall well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to manage these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q1, Q16) and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17) are consistent with <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, their experiences of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) may be related to their OCD symptoms. The patient's <quote>\"thoughts just keep coming back, and I try to push them away\"</quote> suggests a pattern of intrusive thoughts and compulsions. While the patient also reports <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2, Q14), their primary concerns seem to center around the intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Specifically, <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> therapy can help the patient learn to manage their <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n2. **Medications**: Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>clomipramine</med> to help manage OCD symptoms.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene**: Encourage the patient to establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and engage in relaxing activities to improve sleep quality.\n4. **Anxiety Management**: Teach the patient <med>relaxation techniques</med> such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. **Follow-up appointments**: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
