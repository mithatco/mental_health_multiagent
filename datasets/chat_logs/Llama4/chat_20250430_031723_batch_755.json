We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported feeling down and hopeless, the therapist followed up with questions about sleep patterns and interest in activities, which are key symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. Similarly, the therapist explored anxiety and worry, which are pervasive in the patient's life, and addressed intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors indicative of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The questions asked by the therapist precisely reflect DSM-5 criteria and clearly target clinical symptoms. For instance, when assessing for suicidal ideation, the therapist directly asked, 'Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?' which aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for Suicidal Ideation. The therapist also used clinically accurate language when discussing symptoms, such as 'intrusive thoughts' and 'repetitive behaviors,' which are specific to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics based on the patient's disclosures. For example, after the patient mentioned avoiding crowded places due to anxiety, the therapist logically followed up with questions about somatic symptoms and concerns about physical health. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) clearly align with the patient's reported symptoms. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For instance, the therapist noted that the patient's reported low mood, lack of interest, and changes in sleep patterns are indicative of MDD. The therapist also provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration, ruling out other potential conditions.",
