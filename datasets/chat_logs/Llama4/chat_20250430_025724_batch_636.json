We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Depressive symptoms include loss of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and decreased pleasure in daily life. Anxiety symptoms include excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties are also reported.

The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as a coping mechanism are notable risk factors that require immediate attention.
