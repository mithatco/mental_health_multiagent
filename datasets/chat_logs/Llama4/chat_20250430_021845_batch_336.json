Their reports of intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and sleep disturbances suggest significant distress and impairment. The patient's symptoms may be indicative of multiple diagnoses, including MDD, Anxiety Disorder, OCD, and potentially PTSD. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's suicidal ideation and increased risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior necessitate close monitoring and crisis intervention planning.",
