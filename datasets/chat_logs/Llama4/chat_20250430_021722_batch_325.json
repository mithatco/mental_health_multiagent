However, there were minor instances where the phrasing could have been more precise or aligned with specific DSM-5 terminology. For example, when discussing 'feelings of being lost' and 'not knowing who I really am or what I want out of life,' the therapist could have directly linked these to identity issues or existential concerns using more standardized language.",

However, there could have been a more detailed exploration of alternative diagnoses and a deeper discussion of how the patient's symptoms meet specific DSM-5 criteria for each disorder. The justification provided is clinically sound but could be more comprehensive.",

The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences.

Instead, it focuses on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Anxiety Disorder, which suggests a different condition. However, it's worth noting that depressive symptoms can be present in both MDD and bipolar disorder, but the absence of any mention of manic or hypomanic episodes makes it unlikely that bipolar disorder is being considered.",

Additionally, you've reported <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>, such as experimenting with substances without a prescription. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <quote>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> (Q2), <quote>little interest or pleasure in doing things</quote> (Q1), and changes in sleep patterns (Q14). These symptoms, combined with <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7, and Q8), suggest potential diagnoses of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.
