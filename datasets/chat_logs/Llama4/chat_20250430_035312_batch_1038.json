The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'm here to listen and support you throughout. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks are interconnected, and it's essential to address these symptoms comprehensively.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT can help you address your anxiety, depression, and panic attacks by teaching you coping skills and strategies to manage your symptoms.\n2. **Medication:** We may consider medication options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage your depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. **Panic-Focused Therapies:** Therapies like <med>panic-focused CBT</med> or <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med> can help you address your panic attacks and avoidance behaviors.\n4. **Safety Planning:** We need to develop a safety plan to address your suicidal ideation, including identifying emergency contacts and coping strategies.\n5. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm the presence of specific mental health conditions and develop an effective treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a tremendous amount of distress and anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find pleasure in things you used to enjoy. <quote>It's hard to find pleasure in anything when I'm constantly worried about having a panic attack.</quote> Your anxiety and fear of panic attacks have led to avoidance behaviors, making it difficult for you to engage in daily activities and maintain relationships. You've also expressed feelings of hopelessness and depression, and have even had thoughts of self-harm. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms meet criteria for <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> due to the presence of recurrent panic attacks, fear of having another attack, and avoidance behaviors (Q6-Q8). Additionally, the patient's depressive symptoms, such as feeling down and hopeless (Q2), loss of interest in activities (Q1), and thoughts of self-harm (Q11), suggest a potential diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks are interconnected, and it's essential to address these symptoms comprehensively.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT can help you address your anxiety, depression, and panic attacks by teaching you coping skills and strategies to manage your symptoms.\n2. **Medication:** We may consider medication options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage your depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. **Panic-Focused Therapies:** Therapies like <med>panic-focused CBT</med> or <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med> can help you address your panic attacks and avoidance behaviors.\n4. **Safety Planning:** We need to develop a safety plan to address your suicidal ideation, including identifying emergency contacts and coping strategies.\n5. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm the presence of specific mental health conditions and develop an effective treatment plan.",
