      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, feeling like you're just going through the motions of life without much joy. You mentioned a <quote>\"cloud of sadness\"</quote> following you around, making it hard to shake off, and that you're constantly worried about everything else. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life, relationships, and even your physical health. You expressed feeling <quote>\"lost\"</quote> and unsure of who you are or what you want out of life, which can be really tough to navigate.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate significant <sym>anxious distress</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, which seem to be intertwined and impacting daily life. The <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> and <sym>behaviors</sym> you described, such as checking things over and over, suggest possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> symptoms, but more information is needed to confirm this. Your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also noteworthy. Given the information, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> seem to be the most fitting diagnoses, but further evaluation is necessary to rule out other conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic interview to gather more information and confirm the diagnoses.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, with a qualified healthcare professional.\n4. Develop a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and manage <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <med>symptom journal</med> to track their symptoms and identify patterns.",
