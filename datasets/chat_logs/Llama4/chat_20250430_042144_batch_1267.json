This tool helps us understand various mental health domains and identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You're also experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym> that are difficult to manage. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and that they're affecting your relationships and daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you work through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym> (Q16 and Q17) are characteristic of <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1 and Q2) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) may also indicate co-occurring <med>anxiety disorders</med>. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.

Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms and <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> for <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n3.
