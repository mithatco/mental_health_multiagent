You're feeling <sym>down, depressed, and hopeless</sym> (Q2), and you've noticed a decrease in interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy (Q1). You're also experiencing <sym>anxiety and worry</sym> (Q6) about your future, finances, and relationships. It's like you're stuck in a rut and can't get out of it. I can sense the emotional pain and struggle you're going through, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, the patient's experiences of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>anxiety-related avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's recent life changes and stressors may have contributed to their current mental health concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to symptoms.\n3. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, may be considered to help manage symptoms.\n4. Development of a self-care plan to improve sleep habits, increase physical activity, and enhance overall well-being.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
