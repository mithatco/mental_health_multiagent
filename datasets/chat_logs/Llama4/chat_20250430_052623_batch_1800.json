It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and that they're impacting your relationships and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile with co-occurring <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive</sym> symptoms.
