The patient's reports of a traumatic event (\"the accident\") and subsequent symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognition and mood are particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the patient's expression of suicidal ideation without intent but with significant emotional pain underscores the need for immediate support and safety planning. Substance use as a coping mechanism further complicates the clinical presentation. Comprehensive assessment and formulation of a treatment plan addressing these areas are warranted.",
