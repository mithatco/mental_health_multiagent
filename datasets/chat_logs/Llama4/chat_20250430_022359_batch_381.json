This assessment helps us understand your current symptoms and how they've been affecting you over the past two weeks. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
