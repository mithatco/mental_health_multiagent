Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Anxiety symptoms, including worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, are also prominent. The patient reports sleep disturbances, fatigue, and somatic complaints. Suicidal ideation is a concerning risk factor. Overall, the patient's responses suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, possibly with anxious distress. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm this impression and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Clinical Impression:**\n\nThe patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a high level of distress and impairment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough clinical interview and consideration of additional assessment tools, is warranted to determine the patient's specific needs and develop a targeted treatment plan. The patient's suicidal ideation and increased irritability and anger necessitate careful risk assessment and management.",

It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>changes in appetite</sym> (not explicitly reported but inferred through <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>), and <sym>fatigue</sym> are all consistent with MDD. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> support the specifier of <med>anxious distress</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further underscores the need for immediate and comprehensive care.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic interview and evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxious symptoms.\n3. Consideration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Crisis intervention and <med>suicidal prevention strategies</med> to ensure the patient's safety.",
