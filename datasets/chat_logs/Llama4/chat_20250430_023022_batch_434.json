Your symptoms, such as <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of the accident, suggest that you're struggling to process and cope with this traumatic event.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>intrusive memories</sym> (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q5, Q8), and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> (Q3, Q6), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>.
