I'm going to use a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to help us have this conversation. This questionnaire will help us identify any areas that might be concerning and guide our discussion. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in activities\n- Increased irritability and anger\n- Anxiety and panic\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Cognitive difficulties (concentration, memory)\n- Feelings of hopelessness and detachment\n- Suicidal ideation (passive)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of negative affectivity, including depression, anxiety, and irritability\n- Significant distress and impairment across multiple domains of functioning\n- Avoidance behaviors (social, anxiety-provoking situations)\n- Physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches)\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and energy, feelings of hopelessness\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Hypersomnia\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** Concentration and memory difficulties\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation (passive), although the patient does not endorse intent or plan\n- Increased risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior given the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxious, and sleep-related symptoms. The endorsement of passive suicidal ideation warrants careful assessment and management. Cognitive difficulties and physical complaints further underscore the patient's significant distress and functional impairment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a tailored treatment plan are necessary to address these clinical concerns.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Panic Disorder\n- Sleep-Wake Disorder (Hypersomnia)\n- Adjustment Disorder\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., suicide risk assessment) as warranted\n- Develop a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, IPT), pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both\n- Regularly monitor symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation and overall treatment response.",
