Their responses suggest a significant impact on daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.

Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other relevant areas, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the language used was slightly vague or imprecise. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist did not specifically define 'usual' or inquire about the patient's typical sleep patterns. However, the questions were largely clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and adequately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's report of suicidal ideation and psychotic experiences. The conversation had a coherent and logical structure.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Distress, Psychotic Features, clearly aligns with the patient's reported symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' and 'hearing voices.' The reasoning behind the diagnosis was well-articulated and clinically sound.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor instances where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist immediately shifted to crisis intervention, which was appropriate but could have been preceded by a more empathetic acknowledgment of the patient's distress."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant domains, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound. While the conversation was largely empathetic and professional, there were minor areas for improvement in terms of clinical relevance and empathy. Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong ability to conduct a thorough and clinically relevant assessment.",
