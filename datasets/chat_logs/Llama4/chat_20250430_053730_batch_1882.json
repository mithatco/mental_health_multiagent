The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I'll ask each one in turn. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
