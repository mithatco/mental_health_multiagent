You mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and it's like a cloud follows you around. You're also experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, and avoiding situations that make you anxious. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's taking a toll on your well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>behaviors</sym> (Q17), which are characteristic of <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) suggest <med>MDD</med>. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7) further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm these potential diagnoses.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>exposure and response prevention (ERP)</med> to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure your safety.\n5. Encourage you to keep a <med>symptom journal</med> to track your symptoms and identify patterns.",
