They exhibit avoidance behaviors, self-doubt, and uncertainty about their identity and goals. The patient's responses indicate a high level of psychological distress, and their suicidal ideation and substance use pose significant risk factors.

Your feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety are understandable, and it's clear that they're impacting your daily life.

Additionally, your experiences of hearing voices and feeling like people can hear your thoughts suggest <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, which are sometimes seen in <med>MDD with Psychotic Features</med>. Your <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> may also be related to your depressive disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that may include <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>.\n3. Regular check-ins with a mental health professional to monitor symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n4. Consideration of <med>hospitalization</med> if suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms worsen.\n5. Encouragement to engage in self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support groups, to help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.",
