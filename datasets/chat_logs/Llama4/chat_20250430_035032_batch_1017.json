This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health across different domains. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and we'll go through them one by one. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports feeling disconnected from activities they used to enjoy (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and having thoughts about hurting themselves (Q11), though they clarify these are not active plans.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences irritability (Q3), anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoids situations that make them anxious (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Reports sleeping more than usual (Q4) and overall problems with sleep quality (Q14).\n- **Substance Use:** Admits to using marijuana and prescription painkillers without a prescription (Q23).\n- **Cognitive and Emotional Symptoms:** Experiences memory problems (Q15), unpleasant thoughts/urges/images (Q16), and feelings of detachment (Q18).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Mood and Affective Symptoms:** The patient consistently reports symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety, including decreased interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and increased anxiety.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient acknowledges substance use, which may be related to attempts at self-medication for their mental health symptoms.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Avoids situations that induce anxiety, which could be limiting their social and occupational functioning.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low interest/pleasure (Q1), feeling down/depressed/ hopeless (Q2), changes in sleep (Q4), and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Persistent feelings of anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- **Substance Use Disorder (SUD):** Use of substances without a prescription (Q23), suggesting possible misuse or dependency.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Dissociative Symptoms:** Feelings of detachment (Q18) and possibly unaddressed trauma.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports having thoughts about hurting themselves (Q11), indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use:** The use of substances without a prescription (Q23) poses risks for overdose, legal issues, and worsening mental health.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and substance use, which are impacting their daily functioning and overall well-being. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment and development of a safety plan. Patterns of avoidance and substance use suggest possible co-occurring mental health disorders, including Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Substance Use Disorder. Further evaluation is warranted to determine the presence of PTSD or dissociative disorders given the patient's reports of detachment. The clinical picture suggests a complex presentation requiring comprehensive assessment and multimodal treatment planning. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Anxiety Disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder)\n- Substance Use Disorder\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n- Dissociative Disorders\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic evaluation\n- Development of a safety plan given the presence of suicidal ideation\n- Consideration of pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety symptoms\n- Psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), to address symptoms and coping mechanisms\n- Substance use counseling or referral to a substance abuse program.",

You're also experiencing a lot of anxiety, irritability, and have had panic attacks. It sounds incredibly tough to deal with these feelings, especially when they interfere with your daily life and relationships. Your sleep has been affected, and you've been using substances without a prescription, which can add another layer of complexity to your situation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> (Q4). Their reports of <sym>persistent anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and <sym>avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations</sym> (Q8) support a diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The use of substances without a prescription (Q23) indicates a potential <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, possibly related to self-medication for their mental health symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct an in-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a safety plan given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without intent or plan.\n3. Consider pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety symptoms, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.\n4. Engage in psychotherapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med>, to address symptoms and coping mechanisms.\n5. Provide substance use counseling or refer the patient to a substance abuse program to address <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n6. Encourage the patient to keep a symptom journal to track their mood, anxiety, and substance use patterns.",
