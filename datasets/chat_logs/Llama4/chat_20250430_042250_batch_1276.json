Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a tool to help identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive disorders: the patient's reported lack of interest or pleasure in activities, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and empty feelings may indicate a depressive disorder.\n* Anxiety disorders: the patient's reported anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations may indicate an anxiety disorder.\n* Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): the patient's reported avoidance of situations that remind them of a traumatic event (Q8) and intrusive thoughts or images (Q16) may indicate PTSD.\n* Substance use: the patient's reported use of alcohol to cope with sleep disturbances (Q21) may indicate a substance use issue.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation: the patient's reported thoughts of not wanting to be here (Q11) may indicate a risk for suicidal behavior.\n* Self-medication: the patient's reported use of alcohol to cope with sleep disturbances and anxiety may indicate self-medication.\n\n**5.

The patient's reported sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and cognitive difficulties may be related to their stress and anxiety levels. The patient's avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations and intrusive thoughts or images may indicate PTSD. The patient's reported suicidal ideation and self-medication with alcohol are concerning and require immediate attention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan are warranted to address these clinical concerns.",
