All domains were touched upon, but the question about 'starting lots more projects than usual or doing more risky things than usual' was not fully explored in the context of mania. The therapist could have probed deeper into this aspect to better understand the patient's experience.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were moments where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have directly linked it to the DSM-5 criteria for mania or hypomania. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but occasionally lacked specificity.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the therapist could have followed up more extensively. For example, after the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist could have explored this further before moving on to the next question.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS, was generally supported by the patient's symptoms. The therapist cited specific symptoms like mood swings, irritability, and impulsive behaviors. However, the justification could have been stronger with more explicit links to DSM-5 criteria and a clearer rule-out of other potential diagnoses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist displayed empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. However, there were moments where a deeper emotional acknowledgment could have been beneficial, such as when the patient discussed feeling like a burden to others."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist conducted a comprehensive assessment covering most DSM-5 domains. While there were minor issues with question phrasing and follow-up, the conversation was generally well-structured and empathetic. The diagnosis was supported by patient symptoms, but could have benefited from more explicit DSM-5 criteria links. Overall, this was a strong assessment with areas for minor improvement.",

You described feeling \"on top of the world\" at times, only to crash into depressive states. <quote>it's hard to explain</quote>. I sense that you're frustrated and concerned about your emotions and behaviors, particularly how they impact your relationships and daily life. Your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym> suggest that you're facing a complex set of challenges. I'm here to support you in exploring these experiences and finding ways to improve your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, NOS</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>mood swings</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> are consistent with <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling \"on top of the world\" and then crashing into depressive states suggest <sym>episodic mood swings</sym>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>substance use</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> may be related to their mood symptoms. A diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder, NOS</med> is warranted due to the presence of <sym>bipolar symptoms</sym> that do not meet the full criteria for a specific bipolar disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses, including <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>.\n2.
