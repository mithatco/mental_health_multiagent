This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and guide our conversation. Everything discussed here is confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and you can share your experiences with me. We have 23 questions to go through, and I'll make sure to go at a comfortable pace. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Each dimension was thoroughly explored, and the patient provided detailed responses. The therapist ensured that no domain was skipped or superficially covered, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist could have used more direct language to ensure clarity. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent and engaging dialogue, effectively building on the patient's disclosures to explore symptoms in greater depth. Transitions were smooth, and no abrupt topic changes were observed.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder were clearly justified by the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked specific symptoms (e.g., lack of interest or pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, anxiety) to the diagnostic conclusions, demonstrating a thorough understanding of DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were moments where the responses seemed slightly formulaic or lacked personal warmth. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, a more empathetic acknowledgment of the patient's distress could have been provided. Overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone but could improve in showing emotional warmth."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The therapist conducted a comprehensive assessment using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The conversation covered all relevant dimensions, and the diagnostic justification was sound. While the therapist demonstrated clinical competence, there is room for improvement in showing empathy and ensuring questions are phrased with absolute clinical accuracy. Overall, this was a strong assessment with minor areas for growth.",
