Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences.

We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
