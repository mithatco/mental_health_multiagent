Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to assess various aspects of your mental health. This tool helps us identify areas that might need further exploration and ensures we address all relevant concerns. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and we'll go through them one by one. I'm ready to begin with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned that <quote>nothing seems as fun or interesting as it used to</quote>, and it's been hard for you to find joy in daily activities. Additionally, you're experiencing <sym>anxiety, fear, and worry</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> that feel terrifying and overwhelming. It's clear that these symptoms are affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms, as reported, align closely with characteristics of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> are indicative of <med>GAD</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>loss of interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>depressed mood</sym> support a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The absence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> helps to rule out other potential diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnoses and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n3. Pharmacological interventions, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Development of a <med>crisis plan</med> to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure patient safety.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and make adjustments as needed.",
