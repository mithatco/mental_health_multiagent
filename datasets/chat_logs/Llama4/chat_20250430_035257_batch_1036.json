They report significant distress, social withdrawal, and cognitive difficulties. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not plan-specific, warrants careful assessment and monitoring. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's reported dissociative symptoms and somatic complaints also suggest the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.",

It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> You're also experiencing significant distress, feeling down and hopeless, which is affecting your daily life. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're waking up early, unable to fall back asleep. These symptoms are compounded by anxiety and worry, making it difficult for you to cope with everyday situations. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress\n\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as evidenced by <sym>persistent feelings of sadness and emptiness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> suggests <med>anxious distress</med>, which often co-occurs with MDD. The patient's reported <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> may also be related to their depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, psychiatric interview, and potentially, psychological assessments, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, improve coping skills, and enhance relationships.\n3. **Pharmacological Interventions:** <med>antidepressant medication</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Educate the patient on <sym>sleep hygiene practices</sym> to improve sleep quality, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n5. **Crisis Intervention:** Given the patient's reported <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it's essential to ensure they have a crisis plan in place, including a support system and emergency contact information.",
