The patient's negative affect, avoidance behaviors, and self-criticism suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and/or Anxiety Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation and self-criticism warrants careful assessment and monitoring. Further evaluation and diagnostic assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific mental health needs and develop an effective treatment plan.",

You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a constant cloud hanging over you. Your frustration and irritability are high, and you're experiencing significant anxiety and worry about everyday things. Sleep is elusive, and you're tired but can't seem to get a break. You're also struggling with memories and learning new things, and you've been withdrawing from friends and family. Your words convey a sense of desperation and hopelessness, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as indicated by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as feeling empty, down, and hopeless, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in previously enjoyed activities, <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports this diagnosis. While <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> might also be considered given your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, the predominance of depressive symptoms suggests <med>MDD</med> as a primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam and lab tests, to rule out underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) could help you address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacological Interventions**: Depending on the outcome of the diagnostic evaluation, medication such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> might be considered to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Recommendations for regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises, to help improve <sym>sleep</sym> and overall well-being.\n5. **Crisis Intervention**: Given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, it's essential to have a crisis plan in place, including emergency contact numbers and a safe support system.",
