The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment or well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'll ask each one, and you can share your thoughts and feelings. Let's get started. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of these symptoms, particularly the suicidal ideation, necessitates immediate attention and intervention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of suicide risk, and consideration of evidence-based treatments for MDD and anxiety disorders are warranted. Collaboration with other healthcare professionals may be necessary to address the patient's overall well-being.\n\n**DSM-5 Considerations:**\n- **MDD:** Criteria met for depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and diminished interest in activities.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Criteria potentially met for GAD or Social Anxiety Disorder, based on excessive worry, anxiety, and avoidance behaviors.\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depression and anxiety.\n2. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consideration of antidepressants or anxiolytics, pending a thorough medical evaluation and consideration of side effect profiles.\n3. **Suicide Risk Management:** Immediate assessment and mitigation of suicide risk through safety planning and possibly hospitalization if risk is deemed imminent.\n\nThis summary provides a clinical overview based on the patient's self-reported symptoms and experiences, highlighting the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and tailored treatment plan.",
