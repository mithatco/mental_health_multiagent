This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reported impulsivity, mood instability, and cognitive difficulties further support the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use are notable risk factors that require immediate attention. A thorough diagnostic interview and further assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.",
