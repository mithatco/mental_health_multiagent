Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n* **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports experiencing little interest or pleasure in activities (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and having thoughts about hurting themselves (Q11), though they clarify they wouldn't act on these thoughts.\n* **Anxiety and Irritability:** The patient experiences anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and irritability (Q3), which impact daily functioning and relationships.\n* **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, including sleeping less than usual with high energy (Q4), overall poor sleep quality (Q14), and sometimes sleeping 12 hours a day.\n* **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains (Q9) and headaches are common.\n* **Cognitive and Emotional Concerns:** The patient experiences feelings of detachment (Q18), uncertainty about their identity and life goals (Q19), and difficulties in relationships (Q20).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n* **Mood Swings and Emotional Dysregulation:** The patient's responses suggest significant mood swings, irritability, and emotional instability.\n* **Anxiety and Avoidance:** Anxiety (Q6) and fear of situations that make them anxious (Q8) lead to avoidance behaviors.\n* **Substance Use:** The patient reports some history of recreational substance use (Q23) but does not indicate a regular or problematic pattern.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Recurrent feelings of depression (Q2), loss of interest in activities (Q1), and changes in sleep patterns (Q4, Q14) are indicative.\n* **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms of anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) are concerning.\n* **Substance Use Disorders:** While the patient reports limited substance use, it's an area to monitor for potential escalation or negative impacts.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n* **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), which is a significant risk factor.\n* **Emotional and Behavioral Dysregulation:** High levels of irritability (Q3), anxiety (Q6), and emotional distress suggest a need for coping strategies and emotional regulation techniques.\n\n### 5.

Suicidal ideation and a history of substance use are noted risk factors. Sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and relationship difficulties further complicate the clinical picture.
