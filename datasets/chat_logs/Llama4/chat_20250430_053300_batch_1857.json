Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Hypersomnia (Q4)\n- Decreased motivation and activity (Q5)\n- Anxiety and worry (Q6)\n- Panic episodes (Q7)\n- Avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8)\n- Somatic symptoms (headaches, stomachaches) (Q9)\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q14)\n- Cognitive issues (concentration and memory problems) (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Dissociation (Q18)\n- Identity issues (Q19)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- **Mood and Affective Symptoms:** Predominant symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia, irritability, and anxiety, suggesting a possible mood disorder with anxious features.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Reports of hypersomnia and later confirms sleep quality issues, indicating significant sleep disturbances.\n- **Cognitive and Somatic Complaints:** The patient reports cognitive difficulties, somatic complaints, and dissociative symptoms, which could be related to stress, anxiety, or depressive disorders.\n- **Avoidance and Social Withdrawal:** Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal suggest anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep and motivation.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic episodes, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Intrusive thoughts and dissociation might suggest PTSD, especially if related to a specific event.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Reports of suicidal thoughts indicate a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation (Q11):** The patient reports thoughts of not being here anymore, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies use of illicit substances or misuse of prescription medications, which is a positive indicator but should be monitored.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by significant depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, hypersomnia, decreased motivation), anxiety (worry, panic, avoidance), and additional symptoms suggestive of possible PTSD (intrusive thoughts, dissociation). Cognitive and somatic complaints are also noted. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment and immediate development of a safety plan. The clinical presentation suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, potentially involving mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and/or trauma-related disorders.",

You've expressed that it's hard to find pleasure in activities that normally bring you joy, and you've been experiencing <sym>increased irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. You're also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that can be distressing. It's clear that you're going through a tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder with Anxious Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns (<sym>hypersomnia</sym>), decreased motivation, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The co-occurrence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym> suggests anxious features. While <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> could be considered due to <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym>, there's insufficient information to confirm exposure to a traumatic event.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan.\n2. Initiate therapy, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med>, to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with antidepressants or anxiolytics under close monitoring.\n4. Encourage <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n6. Explore <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.",
