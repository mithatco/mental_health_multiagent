This assessment helps us understand your current symptoms and how they've been affecting you over the past two weeks. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'm here to listen to your experiences. Let's begin. 1.

Your experiences with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are valid and understandable, given the challenges you've been facing. It takes courage to share your story, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>anxiety symptoms</med> and <med>psychotic symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses suggest a pervasive experience of negative emotions, including <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym>. The presence of <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, such as hearing whispers (Q12), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, like problems with memory (Q15), are concerning. Your <quote>feelings of detachment from yourself and others</quote> (Q18) and <quote>not knowing who you really are or what you want out of life</quote> (Q19) may indicate a more complex clinical profile. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm this impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam, psychological assessments, and a detailed medical history, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any underlying conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan, which may include <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or antipsychotics, and <med>psychotherapies</med>, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy.\n3. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n4. Consideration of <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment, given your report of using substances without a prescription (Q23).\n5. Crisis intervention and support, given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11).",
