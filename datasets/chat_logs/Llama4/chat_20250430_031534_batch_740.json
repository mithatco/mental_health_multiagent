I've been going through the motions, but it all feels so empty</quote>. You're also experiencing <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are affecting your daily life. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings, and it's taking a toll on your relationships and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a significant presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2). The patient also reports <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15). These symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without a plan warrants careful monitoring and risk assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.
