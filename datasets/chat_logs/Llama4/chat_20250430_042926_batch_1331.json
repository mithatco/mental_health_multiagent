For example, when asking about 'sleep problems,' the therapist could have been more specific about types of sleep disturbances. However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. However, there were a few minor logical inconsistencies, such as not immediately following up on the patient's mention of suicidal ideation with a more detailed safety plan discussion.",
