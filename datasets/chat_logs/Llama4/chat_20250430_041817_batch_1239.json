This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual but still having a lot of energy,' the therapist could have specified 'hypomanic episodes' to better align with DSM-5 terminology. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use, and ensured that the conversation was coherent and well-structured. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode, clearly aligns with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked specific symptoms (e.g., little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, changes in sleep patterns) to the diagnostic criteria. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was sound, and alternative diagnoses were implicitly considered through the comprehensive assessment.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a professional tone, but there were moments where the interaction felt slightly formulaic. For instance, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate emotional support. However, overall, the therapist maintained a warm and personalized interaction."

The therapist effectively explored all domains, and the diagnostic justification was clear and sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was strong.",
