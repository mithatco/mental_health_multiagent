The presence of suicidal ideation, anxiety-panic cycle, and avoidance behaviors highlights the need for comprehensive assessment, treatment planning, and risk management.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of distress and impairment in various areas of your life. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and a cloud of sadness follows you around. You also shared that you're constantly on edge, worried about having panic attacks, and have trouble sleeping. These symptoms are affecting your relationships and daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>sleep-related</sym> symptoms. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), <sym>fear of panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) may indicate a <med>panic disorder</med> or <med>agoraphobia</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>low interest/pleasure</sym> (Q1), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), and <sym>thoughts of self-harm</sym> (Q11) warrant further exploration for <med>major depressive disorder</med>. Your <quote>\"cloud of sadness\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling disconnected\"</quote> also suggest a possible <med>depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>anxiety</med>, <med>depressive</med>, and <med>sleep disorders</med>.\n2. Develop a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure patient safety.\n3. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms.\n4. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> symptoms.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to monitor <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and identify potential triggers.",
