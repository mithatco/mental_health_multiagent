The therapist ensured that all relevant areas, including depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use, were covered. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a clear understanding of the patient's symptoms and experiences.",

The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter the questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, ensuring that the assessment was both relevant and accurate.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The questions built smoothly on previous responses, creating a fluid and natural conversation. The therapist also appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and anxiety symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The diagnosis was directly linked to DSM-5 criteria, and the justification was comprehensive and clinically sound. Alternative diagnoses were implicitly considered through the comprehensive assessment.",
