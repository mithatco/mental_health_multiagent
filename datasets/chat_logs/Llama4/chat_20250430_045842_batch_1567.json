You mentioned feeling <quote>\"down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote> and experiencing <quote>\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"</quote> that you used to enjoy. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your relationships and overall well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties, along with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym>, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of anxious distress, as indicated by your reports of feeling <quote>\"nervous, anxious, or on edge\"</quote> and experiencing <quote>\"panic or being frightened\"</quote>, further supports this diagnosis. Your responses also suggest potential <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> symptoms, but it's not clear if these symptoms are sufficient to warrant a separate diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a mental health professional to further assess and address your symptoms.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider.\n3. Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based therapies to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n4. Practice <med>self-care strategies</med>, such as mindfulness, relaxation techniques, and regular exercise, to help manage stress and improve mood.\n5. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to address suicidal ideation and ensure your safety.",
