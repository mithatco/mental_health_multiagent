This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports suggest a possible diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, with potential co-occurring depressive symptoms. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these findings and develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's risk factors and warning signs, including potential suicidal ideation, will be closely monitored.",
