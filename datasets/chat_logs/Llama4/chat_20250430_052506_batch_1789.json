Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Overwhelming anxiety and fear of panic attacks\n- Depressed mood and hopelessness\n- Irritability and short-temperedness\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety\n- Physical symptoms during and outside of panic attacks (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath)\n- Intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors (e.g., checking and seeking reassurance)\n- Feelings of detachment and isolation\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of anxiety and fear, particularly related to panic attacks, influencing daily functioning and interpersonal relationships.\n- Co-occurring depressive symptoms, including decreased pleasure in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- Significant impact on sleep quality and daily functioning.\n- Use of avoidance and safety-seeking behaviors.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms suggest a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia, given the fear of panic attacks and avoidance of places or situations that might trigger an attack.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Presence of depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and sleep disturbances could indicate a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the experience of panic attacks and persistent fear could suggest elements of PTSD, particularly if there are unreported traumatic experiences.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** The patient's report of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking) might suggest OCD symptoms.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports occasional thoughts about how it would be easier if they didn\u2019t have to deal with their panic attacks anymore, indicating a low level of suicidal ideation without intent or plan.\n- **Substance Use:** The use of marijuana to relax and potential for dependency.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation primarily characterized by symptoms of anxiety (panic disorder with possible agoraphobia) and depression. The pervasive fear of panic attacks significantly impacts daily functioning, social relationships, and overall quality of life. Co-occurring depressive symptoms and potential for substance use as a coping mechanism are noted. The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors may suggest additional psychiatric concerns. The patient's report of suicidal ideation without intent necessitates careful monitoring and intervention to mitigate risk. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of a treatment plan that addresses these multifaceted needs are warranted.",

It's hard to find pleasure in anything when I'm constantly worried about having a panic attack.\"</quote>. Your symptoms include <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, which are all interconnected and affecting your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>panic disorder</med> due to the recurrent panic attacks and persistent fear of having another attack, leading to <sym>agoraphobia</sym> (fear of being in public or situations where escape might be difficult). The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>major depressive disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (e.g., checking and seeking reassurance) could suggest <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med> symptoms but are not sufficient for a standalone diagnosis. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without intent or plan necessitates careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>panic disorder</med> and <sym>depressive symptoms</med>.\n2. Consider <med>medication</med> (e.g., SSRIs) for managing <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3.
