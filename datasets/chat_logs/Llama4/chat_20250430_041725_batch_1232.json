Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, Q2).\n- Increased irritability (Q3).\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14).\n- Predominant anxiety symptoms, including feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of situations due to anxiety (Q8).\n- Physical symptoms associated with panic, such as aches, pains, and autonomic responses (Q9).\n- Feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm (Q11).\n- Cognitive and emotional difficulties, including repetitive thoughts (Q16), feelings of detachment (Q18), and identity confusion (Q19).\n- Social relationship challenges (Q20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A significant pattern of anxiety and fear dominates the patient's symptomatology, including panic attacks, general anxiety, and avoidance behaviors.\n- Depressive symptoms are present, including decreased pleasure in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep and energy levels.\n- The patient experiences a range of physical symptoms that are likely related to their anxiety and panic attacks.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's symptoms strongly suggest an anxiety disorder, potentially Panic Disorder given the presence of panic attacks and significant avoidance behavior.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder:** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of hopelessness are indicative of depression.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the presence of panic attacks and severe anxiety could suggest a trauma-related disorder; further assessment is warranted.\n- **Risk of Suicide:** The patient reports thoughts of self-harm, indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and intervention.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient has had thoughts of hurting themselves, which signifies a critical risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to excess or without a prescription, the avoidance of alcohol and certain medications due to anxiety might indicate a self-medication pattern in the past or a fear of exacerbating symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture primarily characterized by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Predominant symptoms include recurrent panic attacks, persistent feelings of anxiety, depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, and significant distress in social and occupational functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitates immediate attention. The clinical impression suggests the possible presence of an anxiety disorder, likely panic disorder, and major depressive disorder. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of trauma history, substance use, and a mental status exam, is necessary to guide treatment planning. The patient's symptoms indicate a high level of distress and impairment, warranting a prompt and comprehensive therapeutic approach.",
