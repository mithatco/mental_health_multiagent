Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'thoughts of actually hurting yourself?' (Q11), the therapist ensured that the patient felt heard and provided a supportive response. The therapist also thoroughly explored other critical areas such as depression (Q1-2), anxiety (Q6-8), and substance use (Q21-23).",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For instance, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual, but still have a lot of energy?' (Q4), the therapist could have specified what is meant by 'a lot of energy' to better align with DSM-5 terminology. However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. However, there were a couple of instances where the conversation could have benefited from smoother transitions. For example, after the patient discussed 'unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images that repeatedly enter your mind?' (Q16), the therapist could have explored this further before moving to 'feeling driven to perform certain behaviors or mental acts over and over again?' (Q17). Overall, the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",
