The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. Over the next session, I'll ask you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and enjoying your hobbies, but feeling a bit disconnected from them lately <quote>I've been feeling a bit disconnected from them lately</quote>. You also shared that you experience <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, especially in social situations, and that you've been having trouble sleeping and feeling rested. It's clear that you're struggling to connect with others and feel close to them <quote>Not feeling close to other people or enjoying your relationships with them</quote>. I'm here to support you and help you work through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations (Q6, Q7, Q8), <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3), and avoidance of social situations (Q8), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling disconnected and experiencing intrusive thoughts (Q16) also support this diagnosis. While the patient denies <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2), their reports of feeling stuck and disconnected suggest some <med>depressive disorder</med> symptoms, which warrant further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>.\n4. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out other potential diagnoses, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n5. Consideration of medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.",
