Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment is a tool to help identify areas that might need further exploration and support. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's recent divorce and reported stress may be contributing factors to their current mental health concerns. The presence of suicidal ideation, self-neglect, and functional impairment highlights the need for comprehensive assessment, support, and potential therapeutic interventions. Further evaluation and exploration of these concerns are warranted to develop an effective treatment plan.",
