This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'm here to listen and support you. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'compared to usual' to better align with DSM-5 terminology. However, these inaccuracies were minor and did not significantly impact the clinical relevance of the questions.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively used the patient's disclosures to guide the conversation and explore symptoms in greater depth. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration and linked the diagnosis to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments where the language seemed slightly formal or technical. For example, when discussing 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist could have offered more emotional validation and support. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language and emotional validation, the overall performance was excellent.",
