This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and inform our work together. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

However, these were minor inaccuracies and did not significantly impact the clinical relevance.",

The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression throughout.",
