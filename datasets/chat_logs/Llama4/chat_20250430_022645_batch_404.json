This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports experiencing periods of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), little interest or pleasure in doing things (Q1), and thoughts of actually hurting themselves (Q11), although they clarify they wouldn't act on these thoughts.\n- **Manic/Hypomanic Symptoms:** Increased irritability (Q3), reduced need for sleep with high energy (Q4), engaging in more projects or risky behaviors than usual (Q5), and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoids situations that make them anxious (Q8).\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Reports of unexplained aches and pains (Q9) and problems with sleep affecting overall quality (Q14).\n- **Cognitive and Emotional Functioning:** Difficulty with memory (Q15), feeling detached from themselves or their surroundings (Q18), and uncertainty about their identity or life goals (Q19).\n- **Substance Use:** Admission of using substances not prescribed to them and using marijuana (Q23).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Mood Swings:** The patient seems to experience significant mood swings, oscillating between depressive states and manic/hypomanic episodes, which impact their functioning and well-being.\n- **Anxiety and Stress:** High levels of anxiety and stress are reported, affecting daily life and contributing to sleep disturbances.\n- **Substance Use as Coping Mechanism:** The patient's substance use might be a coping mechanism for their mental health symptoms.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Recurrent depressive episodes.\n- **Bipolar Spectrum Disorder:** Symptoms suggestive of manic and depressive episodes.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic disorder.\n- **Substance Use Disorder:** Potential for misuse of prescribed or illicit substances.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient has had thoughts of hurting themselves, indicating a risk for suicide.\n- **Substance Use:** Use of substances without a prescription or in excess.\n- **Impulsivity:** Engaging in risky behaviors during manic phases.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile suggestive of a mood disorder, likely within the bipolar spectrum, given the reported manic and depressive episodes. Co-occurring anxiety symptoms and substance use complicate the clinical picture. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively planned, necessitates immediate attention. The patient's overall functioning appears to be significantly impacted by these symptoms, highlighting the need for a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses mood stabilization, anxiety management, substance use, and coping strategies. Close monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are recommended to mitigate risk factors and improve quality of life.",
