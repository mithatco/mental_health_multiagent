This tool helps us understand various mental health domains that might be affecting you. Everything discussed will remain confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and we'll go through them one by one. I'm ready to begin with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that you've lost interest in activities you once enjoyed, like painting. You also experience physical symptoms like stomach issues and headaches before social events, and you often worry about being judged or saying something stupid. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and responses suggest a possible diagnosis of <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>, as they experience significant distress and impairment in social situations, which leads to avoidance behaviors. Additionally, their symptoms of anxiety, nervousness, and fear in social situations meet the criteria for an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's negative self-talk, feelings of hopelessness, and physical complaints also support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative self-talk</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>physical symptoms</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n4. A comprehensive assessment of the patient's social communication skills to identify areas for improvement and develop strategies for enhancing <sym>pragmatic communication</sym>.\n5. Consideration of medication, such as anxiolytics or antidepressants, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, if deemed necessary.",
