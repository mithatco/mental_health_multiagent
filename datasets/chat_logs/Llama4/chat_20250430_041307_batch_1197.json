For example, the therapist briefly asked about 'sleeping less than usual' but didn't probe further when the patient responded affirmatively. Similarly, when discussing 'substance use,' the therapist didn't ask specific follow-up questions about the frequency or amount of substance use.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but some phrasing was slightly vague or imprecise. For instance, when asking about 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' the therapist could have used more specific language to match the DSM-5 criteria. Additionally, some questions seemed to conflate multiple symptoms (e.g., 'anxiety' and 'panic attacks'). Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly transitioned between topics or didn't fully follow up on concerning disclosures. For example, when the patient mentioned 'using substances to feel normal or relaxed,' the therapist didn't probe further about the specifics of this behavior. These minor inconsistencies didn't significantly disrupt the conversation but could have been improved.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist's diagnostic conclusions generally aligned with the patient's responses, citing specific symptoms like 'sadness,' 'irritability,' and 'substance use.' However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses weren't explicitly ruled out. The therapist could have also provided more explicit links to DSM-5 criteria to support the diagnoses of Substance Use Disorder and Depressive Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses demonstrated empathy and a professional tone, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. However, there were moments where the therapist's language seemed slightly technical or impersonal. For example, when discussing 'substance use,' the therapist could have offered more personalized support or explored the patient's emotional state in greater depth."

However, some areas could have been explored in greater depth, and the therapist could have used more precise language when phrasing questions. The conversation generally flowed logically, and the therapist showed empathy and a professional tone.
