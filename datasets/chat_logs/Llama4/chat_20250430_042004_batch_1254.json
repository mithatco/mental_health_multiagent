Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports a lack of interest in activities (Q1), feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and a general sense of loss of motivation.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient experiences irritability (Q3), anxiety (Q6), panic (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** The patient reports excessive sleep but still feeling tired (Q4) and overall poor sleep quality (Q14).\n- **Psychological Distress:** The patient mentions aches and pains (Q9), feelings of detachment (Q18), and uncertainty about their identity and life goals (Q19).\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** The patient reports problems with memory (Q15) and intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient expresses thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore (Q11).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Pervasive Depressive and Anxious Affect:** The patient's responses suggest a pervasive mood of depression and anxiety influencing most aspects of their life.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** The patient frequently mentions physical symptoms such as aches and pains (Q9) and sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14).\n- **Cognitive and Emotional Disturbances:** There are reports of cognitive disturbances (Q15, Q16), emotional turmoil (Q2, Q3, Q6), and feelings of detachment (Q18).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low interest/pleasure (Q1), depressed mood (Q2), changes in sleep (Q4), fatigue (Q4), and feelings of worthlessness or guilt (implied through Q10 and Q19).\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Marked by anxiety (Q6), panic (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8).\n- **Psychotic Symptoms:** Possible auditory hallucinations (Q12) and delusional thinking (Q13).\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Endorsement of thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore (Q11) indicates a significant risk.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation (Q11):** A clear and immediate risk factor requiring urgent attention.\n- **Substance Use (Q23):** The patient's use of substances (e.g., marijuana) may be indicative of self-medication for their symptoms.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by significant depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep and motivation), anxiety (generalized anxiety, panic, avoidance), and psychotic symptoms (possible auditory hallucinations, delusional thinking). Cognitive disturbances, including memory issues and intrusive thoughts, are also reported. The presence of suicidal ideation without a clear plan necessitates immediate risk assessment and intervention. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Anxiety Disorders, and possible Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder, necessitating a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and immediate attention to safety concerns. \n\nThe patient would benefit from a thorough assessment, including mood and psychotic symptom evaluation, suicidal risk assessment, and consideration of substance use as a coping mechanism or contributing factor. A collaborative treatment approach addressing both psychiatric symptoms and safety concerns is warranted.",

It's clear that you're going through a really tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q1), changes in sleep (Q4), and <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q4).

The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) expressed by the patient indicates a need for immediate risk assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation, including a detailed psychiatric interview, medical history, and possibly <med>psychological testing</med>, to confirm the diagnosis and assess for other potential conditions.\n2. **Crisis Intervention:** Given the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, immediate steps should be taken to ensure the patient's safety, including possible hospitalization if necessary.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Consideration of <med>antidepressant medication</med>, potentially combined with <med>antipsychotic medication</med> given the psychotic symptoms.\n4. **Psychotherapy:** <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</med> could be beneficial in addressing depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n5. **Substance Use Counseling:** Given the patient's report of <med>substance use</med>, counseling on substance use and potential <med>addiction treatment</med> may be necessary.",
