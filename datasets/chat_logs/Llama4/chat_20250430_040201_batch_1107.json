      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of distress with <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that's affecting your daily life. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy and having a hard time mustering the energy for them. You also shared that you're often on edge, worried about having another panic attack, and that it's led to you avoiding certain situations. These feelings and experiences can be really overwhelming and isolating. It's clear that you're struggling with some significant mental health challenges, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>, given the recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having another attack, and significant avoidance behaviors. The <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <quote>\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote> and lack of interest in activities, suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms indicates a need for a comprehensive treatment plan addressing both anxiety and depression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This form of therapy can help you manage your anxiety and depression by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n2. **Medication**: Consider <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term relief of panic symptoms and <med>SSRIs</med> for long-term management of depression and anxiety.\n3. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. **Regular Follow-Up**: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor your progress, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.\n5. **Substance Use Counseling**: Given the occasional self-medication with alcohol or marijuana, it would be beneficial to address these behaviors to prevent potential <med>substance use disorder</med>.",
