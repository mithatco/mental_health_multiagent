The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'm here to listen and support you throughout this process. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've described a persistent cloud of sadness and hopelessness that's hard to shake off, and it's affecting your relationships and daily functioning. It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of pain and distress, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress, and <med>Insomnia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as evidenced by <sym>persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>, <sym>diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> (early morning wakefulness), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (memory problems). The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> suggests a high level of anxious distress. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan indicates a need for immediate safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm <med>MDD</med> and rule out other conditions.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including crisis intervention and regular check-ins.\n3. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Evaluate the need for <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to help manage symptoms.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them comfort and relaxation, such as exercise, mindfulness, or creative pursuits.",
