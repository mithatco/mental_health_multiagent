        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question naturally following from the patient's previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent and organized approach, ensuring that all relevant areas were explored without abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist also appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Anxiety Disorder, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as feelings of depression, hopelessness, and anxiety. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by explicitly linking the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria and considering alternative diagnoses. The therapist also did not provide a detailed discussion of the differential diagnosis process.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style, acknowledging the patient's distress and validating their experiences. However, there were minor moments where the therapist's responses seemed slightly impersonal or abrupt, such as when discussing sensitive topics like suicidal ideation. Overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding, but could have been more consistently empathetic throughout the conversation."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong effort to systematically assess the patient's symptoms using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist covered all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and showed empathy. However, minor areas for improvement exist, such as refining clinical phrasing and providing more comprehensive diagnostic justification. Overall, the therapist performed well, but attention to these details could enhance future interactions.",
