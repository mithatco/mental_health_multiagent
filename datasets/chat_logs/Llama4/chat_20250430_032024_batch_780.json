I'll ask you a series of questions, and you can share your experiences with me. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll make sure to explain each one clearly. Let's get started.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a range of distressing emotions and experiences. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness that's been weighing you down. <quote>\"There's this cloud over me, and I don't know how to shake it off.\"</quote> You're also experiencing anxiety, irritability, and difficulties with sleep, which are all taking a toll on your daily life. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress, and Possible Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depression</sym> (e.g., low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness), <sym>anxiety</sym> (e.g., excessive worry, panic), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress. Additionally, your reports of <sym>dissociation</sym> (e.g., feeling detached from yourself) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> raise the possibility of co-occurring <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: Schedule a thorough diagnostic interview to assess for <med>MDD</med>, <med>PTSD</med>, and other potential diagnoses.\n2. Therapy: Consider <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Trauma-Focused CBT</med> to address depressive, anxious, and traumatic symptoms.\n3. Pharmacological interventions: Explore medication options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, exercise, and relaxation, to help regulate mood and reduce anxiety.\n5. Regular follow-up: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
