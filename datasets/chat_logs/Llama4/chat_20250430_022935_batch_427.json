This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist explored depression (Q1, Q2), anger (Q3), mania (Q4, Q5), anxiety (Q6, Q7, Q8), somatic symptoms (Q9, Q10), suicidal ideation (Q11), psychosis (Q12, Q13), sleep problems (Q14), cognitive function (Q15), repetitive thoughts and behaviors (Q16, Q17), dissociation (Q18), identity and relationships (Q19, Q20), and substance use (Q21, Q22, Q23). This comprehensive approach allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's mental health.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For example, when asking about 'intrusive thoughts and compulsions,' the therapist used specific examples that matched the patient's experiences. The questions were phrased in clinically accurate ways, and the therapist did not alter the questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and provided appropriate follow-up questions based on the patient's disclosures. For instance, after the patient mentioned suicidal ideation, the therapist addressed it directly and empathetically. The conversation had no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, maintaining a coherent and conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder symptoms clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The diagnosis was directly linked to DSM-5 criteria, and the therapist considered differential diagnoses. The recommended next steps and treatment options were comprehensive and tailored to the patient's needs.",
