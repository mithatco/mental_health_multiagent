Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist followed up with questions about feeling down, depressed, or hopeless. This thorough exploration justifies a score of 5.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were minor inaccuracies or vague phrasing in a few instances. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual, but still have a lot of energy,' the therapist could have more precisely defined 'a lot of energy.' However, the questions were mostly clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively addressed abrupt disclosures, such as the patient's thoughts of hurting themselves, by immediately acknowledging the concern and expressing support. The conversation's coherence and logical progression justify a perfect score.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and Substance Use Disorder generally align with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and provided clear reasoning. However, there was minor ambiguity in the justification for Substance Use Disorder, as the patient's admission of recreational substance use was not extensively explored.",

Responses were tailored to the patient's emotional state, and distress was acknowledged and validated.
