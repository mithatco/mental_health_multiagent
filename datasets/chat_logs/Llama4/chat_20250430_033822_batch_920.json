You're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic moments</sym> that seem to come out of nowhere, and you're having trouble sleeping due to a racing mind. You're also dealing with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsions that feel overwhelming. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these symptoms, and they're impacting your relationships and overall well-being. <quote>I've been feeling a bit disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's not that I don't have interest, but it's just been harder to find pleasure in them lately.</quote> I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to manage these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16), <sym>compulsions</sym> (Q17), and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) are indicative of <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, their reports of feeling disconnected from previously enjoyed activities (Q1), experiencing <sym>depressive episodes</sym> (Q2), and having trouble sleeping (Q14) suggest <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) is a significant concern that needs to be addressed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with an emphasis on exposure and response prevention (ERP) to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <med>OCD</med> and <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n3. Development of a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consideration of additional therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), to help the patient manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.",
