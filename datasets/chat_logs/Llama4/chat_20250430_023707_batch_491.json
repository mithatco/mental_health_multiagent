Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your mental health. This assessment is a tool to help identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's responses suggest significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not intense, warrants careful monitoring and assessment. The clinical picture may be indicative of multiple diagnoses, including MDD, anxiety disorders, and potentially PTSD.

You experience <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that affects your daily life, making it hard to find motivation and enjoy activities. Your <quote>\"cloud is over me, and I don't know how to shake it off\"</quote> suggests a sense of helplessness. You're also experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and a fear of having another one, which leads to avoidance behaviors. It's clear that you're finding it challenging to cope with these feelings and symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> due to the presence of <sym>excessive anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>, as well as avoidance behaviors (Q8). The patient's reports of <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2) and <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> (Q1) are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. The co-occurrence of these symptoms suggests a complex clinical profile that requires comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. Development of a coping skills toolkit, including relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage <sym>panic attacks</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to gradually increase engagement in previously enjoyed activities to help alleviate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
