Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and social avoidance.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Recurring, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions).\n- **Potential Suicidal Ideation:** Endorsement of thoughts of hurting oneself.\n\n**4.

The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan requires careful assessment and management. The patient's symptoms have significantly impacted daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a tailored treatment plan addressing these areas are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n- Potentially other Anxiety Disorders (e.g., Social Anxiety Disorder)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic interview and/or structured diagnostic tools (e.g., SCID-5) to confirm diagnoses.\n- Assessment of suicide risk regularly.\n- Development of a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, ERP) and pharmacotherapy.",

You mentioned feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> and having <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> that you used to enjoy. Your daily life has been impacted by <sym>anxiety and worry</sym>, and you've been having trouble sleeping due to <sym>racing thoughts</sym>. You're also experiencing <sym>obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors</sym> that are difficult to control. It's clear that these symptoms have taken a toll on your relationships and overall well-being. <quote>I'm not proud of it, but yes, those thoughts have crossed my mind</quote> - it's understandable that you're struggling with these thoughts, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>OCD</med> due to the presence of <sym>recurring, intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> that the patient feels driven to perform. The patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety and worry</sym> suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's symptoms have significantly impacted daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnoses and assess for any additional conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>exposure and response prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their symptoms and identify patterns.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
