The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being and inform our work together. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
