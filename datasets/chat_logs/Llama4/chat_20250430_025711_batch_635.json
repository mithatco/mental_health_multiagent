No attempt was made to explore the patient's symptoms or experiences.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The conversation lacked clinically relevant questions altogether. The therapist did not pose any specific questions related to the patient's symptoms or experiences, which is essential for a clinical assessment. The absence of relevant questions makes it difficult to evaluate the patient's mental health status.",
        "consistency": "The conversation appears to be highly disconnected and lacking in logical progression. The therapist's responses seem to acknowledge the absence of information rather than engaging in a coherent assessment process. There were no follow-up questions or attempts to gather more information, leading to a disjointed conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of 'Undetermined' was made, but it lacks clear justification based on specific symptoms or DSM-5 criteria. The therapist did not have sufficient information to make an accurate diagnosis, but there was no attempt to explore potential symptoms or differential diagnoses. The diagnostic conclusion seems to be a direct result of the lack of information rather than a thorough evaluation.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses showed empathy and a professional tone, acknowledging the individual's potential struggles and expressing a willingness to provide support. However, the lack of specific interactions or questions limits the evaluation of empathy in a more nuanced context. The therapist's acknowledgment of the individual's courage in seeking help demonstrates some level of empathy."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation was severely limited by the absence of specific questionnaire responses from the patient. As a result, the therapist was unable to conduct a comprehensive assessment or provide a definitive diagnosis.
