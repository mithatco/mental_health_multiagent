Their responses indicate significant emotional distress, self-concept uncertainty, and avoidance behaviors. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to assess for potential suicidal ideation.

However, the questions were mostly relevant and targeted clinical symptoms.",
