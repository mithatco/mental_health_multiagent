This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's avoidance behaviors, somatic symptoms, and negative thought patterns (e.g., Q16) may be maintaining their symptoms. The absence of suicidal ideation and substance use is a positive indicator. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these findings and develop an effective treatment plan.",

You also shared that you get anxious and feel like you're being judged, which can make you feel down and hopeless. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and relationships.
