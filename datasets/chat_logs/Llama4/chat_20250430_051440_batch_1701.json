Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were disclosed.

The only potential area for improvement is that some questions could have been more detailed, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",

For instance, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'more than half the days' to better align with DSM-5 thresholds. However, these were minor inaccuracies and did not significantly impact the clinical relevance of the questions.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and impulsivity, and ensured that these topics were explored thoroughly before moving on. The conversation maintained a coherent and understandable progression throughout.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of 'Mood Disorder with Anxious Disturbances, Provisional' generally aligns with the patient's symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnosis to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as mood swings, feelings of hopelessness, and anxiety. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing differential diagnoses and the specific DSM-5 criteria met.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. They acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist responded with concern and a focus on immediate support. The interaction was warm, personalized, and professional throughout."

The therapist maintained a logical flow, showed empathy, and provided a clinically sound diagnosis with clear justification. While minor areas for improvement exist, such as more precise phrasing of some questions and comprehensive differential diagnosis discussion, the overall performance was excellent.",

Your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> are particularly concerning and require immediate attention. I'm here to support you in exploring these feelings and developing a plan to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with Anxious Disturbances, Provisional</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex presentation of mood and anxiety disturbances. The <sym>mood swings</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> reported across various questions point towards a <med>mood disorder</med> with anxious features. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym> increases the risk and urgency for comprehensive evaluation and intervention. The symptoms do not clearly align with a single diagnosis, suggesting the need for further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Crisis Intervention:** Given the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, immediate crisis intervention and risk management are essential. This may involve hospitalization or intensive outpatient support.\n2. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional, including a detailed medical and psychological history, to accurately determine the underlying conditions.\n3. **Development of a Treatment Plan:** Collaborate with the patient to develop a treatment plan addressing <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>impulsive</sym> symptoms. This may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, DBT), medication (e.g., antidepressants, mood stabilizers), or a combination of both.\n4. **Coping Skills and Stress Management:** Teach the patient coping skills and stress management techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>impulsivity</sym>.\n5. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
