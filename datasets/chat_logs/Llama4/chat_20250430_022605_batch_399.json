        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified, generally aligned with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like mood swings, increased energy, and impulsive behaviors to the diagnosis. However, there was minor ambiguity in justification regarding the specific subtype (e.g., Bipolar I or II) due to insufficient information on episode frequency and duration. Further exploration of differential diagnoses could have been beneficial.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with a professional tone. For example, when the patient discussed suicidal ideation, the therapist responded with understanding and concern. However, there were minor moments where the therapist could have been more empathetic, such as providing more emotional validation during the patient's description of hopelessness."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong clinical assessment skillset, effectively covering all DSM-5 dimensions, maintaining a logical conversation flow, and showing empathy. The diagnosis was generally well-supported, though could benefit from further specificity. With some refinement in differential diagnosis consideration and empathetic responses, this conversation could be considered exceptional.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"stuck in a rut\" and that nothing can get you out of it. Your sleep is also affected, with <sym>insomnia</sym> and <sym>hypersomnia</sym> episodes. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a <med>bipolar disorder</med> diagnosis, given the presence of <sym>mood swings</sym>, <sym>increased energy</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>. The <quote>\"up and down\"</quote> pattern you described, with periods of high energy and activity followed by depressive episodes, is consistent with this diagnosis.

Your <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> also raise concerns and warrant further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a more comprehensive evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history.\n2. Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> to help regulate your mood and reduce symptoms.\n3.
