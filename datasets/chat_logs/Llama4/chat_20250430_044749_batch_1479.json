I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of suicidal ideation, substance use as a coping mechanism, and considerable distress across multiple domains highlight the need for a comprehensive treatment plan. This plan should address immediate safety concerns, incorporate trauma-informed care, and focus on managing depressive and anxiety symptoms, improving sleep quality, and enhancing coping skills. Collaboration with other healthcare professionals may be necessary to ensure a holistic approach to the patient's care.",

        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and tailored responses to their emotional state. For instance, when the patient expressed feeling like a burden, the therapist immediately acknowledged the pain and noted the importance of safety planning."
