Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview and physical examination to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including consideration of pharmacological interventions (e.g., antidepressants) and psychotherapy (e.g., <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</med>).\n3.
