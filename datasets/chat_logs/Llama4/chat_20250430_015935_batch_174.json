You've been experiencing <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and it's hard for you to find the motivation to do things. You're also feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and worried a lot of the time, and you've been having trouble sleeping. You're not feeling close to others, and you're struggling to find meaning in life. <quote>\"It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting anymore. I've been going through the motions, but it all feels pretty empty.\"</quote> It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. They report <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2, Q11). Additionally, they experience <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14). These symptoms have been affecting their daily life and relationships. The patient's responses also suggest possible comorbid <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Develop a <med>therapy plan</med> that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address symptoms and improve relationships.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support groups, to help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.\n5. Monitor the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and risk factors closely and develop a <med>crisis plan</med> if necessary.",
