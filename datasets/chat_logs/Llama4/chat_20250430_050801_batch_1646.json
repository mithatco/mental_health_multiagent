This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll be asking you a series of questions, 23 in total, to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. Let's start with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
