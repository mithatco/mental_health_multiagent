Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a comprehensive assessment that will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to a possible traumatic event (the accident) points towards <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>decreased energy</sym> meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's report of an accident and subsequent avoidance behaviors suggest a possible traumatic event, which may be contributing to the current symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>trauma-informed care</med> to address the possible traumatic event.\n3. Consider <med>medication</med> to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track their symptoms and identify triggers.\n5.
