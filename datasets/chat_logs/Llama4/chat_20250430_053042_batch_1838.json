This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this process as comfortable as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Consider joining a <med>support group</med> for individuals with <med>OCD</med> to connect with others who understand what you're going through and to learn from their experiences.",
