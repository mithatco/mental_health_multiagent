This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and avoidance behaviors are also reported. The patient's symptoms appear to be situation-specific, with social situations being the primary trigger.

However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the correct symptoms.",

However, it would have been beneficial to discuss and rule out other potential diagnoses that could present similarly, such as avoidant personality disorder or specific phobias.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that you sometimes worry about saying something wrong or being judged by others. <quote>it's like my heart is racing and I worry about saying something stupid</quote>. It's understandable that you'd want to avoid situations that make you feel this way, but it's also impacting your ability to connect with others and enjoy social interactions. I'm here to support you and help you explore ways to manage these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, including excessive fear, anxiety, and avoidance of social situations due to fear of negative evaluation. The patient's reports of <sym>nervousness, anxiety, and fear</sym> in social situations, as well as their avoidance of such situations, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling down or hopeless, may be related to their social anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym> in social situations.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for symptom management, if warranted.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
