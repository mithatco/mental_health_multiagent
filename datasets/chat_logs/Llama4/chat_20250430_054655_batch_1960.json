You mentioned that sometimes it feels like you're just going through the motions without much joy or purpose, and that can be really tough. It's clear that these <sym>symptoms</sym> are affecting your daily life and relationships. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these <quote>feelings of hopelessness</quote> and <quote>fears</quote>.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxiety</med> and <med>obsessive-compulsive</med> features, provisional diagnosis of <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>.\n\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses indicate a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and increased <sym>irritability and anger</sym> are concerning and warrant further assessment and intervention. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and the presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym> suggest a <med>comorbid diagnosis</med> of <med>anxiety disorder</med> and <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder</med>. The <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> reported by the patient, such as <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>, may be related to <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but this diagnosis should be considered provisional until further evaluation is conducted.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym>, potentially including <med>psychotherapy</med>, <med>medication</med>, or a combination of both.\n3. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med> may be effective in addressing the patient's <sym>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consideration of <med>referral to a specialist</med>, such as a <med>psychiatrist</med> or <med>psychologist</med>, for further evaluation and treatment.",
