The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, A1).\n- Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability (Q2, A2; Q3, A3).\n- Significant sleep disturbances (Q4, A4; Q14, A14).\n- Anxiety and fear, including panic attacks (Q6, A6; Q7, A7).\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8, A8).\n- Somatic complaints (headaches, stomachaches) (Q9, A9).\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11, A11).\n- Cognitive difficulties (concentration, memory) (Q15, A15).\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16, A16).\n- Feelings of detachment and uncertainty about identity and life goals (Q18, A18; Q19, A19).\n- Social withdrawal (Q20, A20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of negative affectivity, including depression, anxiety, and irritability.\n- Significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n- Presence of both internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., irritability) symptoms.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.\n- Anxiety Disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, or Social Anxiety Disorder, given the patient's reports of anxiety, worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- Possible Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Adjustment Disorder, given the recent life change and symptoms of avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and marked arousal.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11, A11) is a significant risk factor that necessitates immediate attention and safety planning.\n- The patient's recent life change and lack of social support or feeling of being understood by others may exacerbate symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, significant distress, and impairment in daily functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation indicates a high level of risk that requires urgent intervention. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses within the depressive and anxiety disorders spectrum, with possible considerations for trauma-related disorders given the context. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of psychosocial history, mental status exam, and possibly further diagnostic tools or interviews, is warranted to guide treatment planning. Immediate focus should be on establishing safety, reducing symptoms, and enhancing coping strategies. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Immediate safety assessment and planning to address suicidal ideation.\n- Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm specific diagnoses.\n- Development of a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, IPT) and pharmacotherapy to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n- Consideration of trauma-informed care if a significant traumatic event is disclosed.\n- Encouragement of social support engagement and stress management techniques.",
