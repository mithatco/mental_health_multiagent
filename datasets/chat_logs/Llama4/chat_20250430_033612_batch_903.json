The patient's reports of suicidal ideation, substance use, and self-medication behaviors indicate significant risk factors that require immediate attention. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the presence of depressive disorders, bipolar spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, or other conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a mix of emotions, from feeling down and hopeless to being overly energetic and motivated. You mentioned times when you just don't care about anything and feel like staying in bed all day, but then there are moments when you're super motivated and want to take on everything at once. <quote>It's hard to explain</quote>. I can sense the frustration and confusion that comes with experiencing such extreme mood swings. You also shared that you've been having trouble sleeping, and when you do, it's either too much or too little. It's clear that these symptoms are affecting your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with Anxiety and Cognitive Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex presentation of <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>mood instability</sym>. The <quote>ups and downs</quote> you've described, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, point towards a <med>mood disorder</med> with possible <med>anxiety</med> and <med>cognitive symptoms</med>. The <quote>dark thoughts</quote> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> you've reported indicate a need for immediate attention and support.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough assessment, including a physical exam, lab tests, and a detailed psychological evaluation, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Medication management: Exploring <med>mood stabilizers</med>, <med>antidepressants</med>, or <med>anxiolytics</med> to help regulate mood and reduce symptoms.\n3. Psychotherapy: Engaging in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to develop coping skills and manage emotions.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encouraging healthy sleep habits, regular exercise, and a balanced diet to help regulate mood and reduce symptoms.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments: Scheduling regular check-ins to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
