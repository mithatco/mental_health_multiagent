However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and effectively targeted key symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from the patient's previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11) and experiences of hallucinations (Q12). The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression throughout.",

The therapist provided a clear rationale for each diagnosis, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses and providing a more detailed differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing sensitive topics like suicidal ideation (Q11), the therapist could have offered more emotional validation and support. Overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's distress."

Your reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are concerning, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.

The co-occurrence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) supports a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) and <sym>panic</sym> (Q7) indicate a diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n3.
