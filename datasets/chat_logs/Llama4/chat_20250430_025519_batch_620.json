The patient's recent divorce may be a contributing factor to their current symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively endorsed, warrants careful monitoring and assessment. Further evaluation and potential referral to specialized care (e.g., psychotherapy, medication) may be necessary to address these concerns. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should be developed to address the patient's specific needs.",
