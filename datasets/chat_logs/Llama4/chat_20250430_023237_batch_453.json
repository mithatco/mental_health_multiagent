You've also reported experiencing <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, such as hearing voices (Q12) and feeling like someone could hear your thoughts (Q13). It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with daily life, and you're feeling disconnected from others and unsure of who you are or what you want out of life (Q19). I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n**<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Psychotic Features</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>**\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms, including <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7), and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym> (Q12, Q13), are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Psychotic Features</med>. The patient's report of <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of anxiety (Q6, Q7) and avoidance behaviors (Q8) suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any underlying conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan, including <med>psychotherapy</med> and <med>medication</med> as needed, to address depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms.\n3. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to help the patient manage <sym>negative thoughts and behaviors</sym> and improve coping skills.\n4. <med>Medication</med> evaluation to consider <med>antidepressants</med>, <med>antipsychotics</med>, and <med>anxiolytics</med> as needed to manage symptoms.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and make adjustments as needed.",
