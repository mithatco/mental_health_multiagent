The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. Key concerns include:\n\n- **Depression:** The patient experiences a lack of interest in activities they used to enjoy (Q1), feelings of being down or hopeless (Q2), and social withdrawal (Q20).\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** Significant symptoms include persistent feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of situations that trigger anxiety (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient reports problems with sleep quality (Q14) and increased need for rest due to anxiety and panic attacks (Q4).\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains (Q9), such as heart pounding, sweating, and chest pain during panic attacks.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves, though without a plan (Q11).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient's responses suggest that anxiety and panic attacks are central to their current mental health concerns. Many symptoms seem to stem from or are exacerbated by these experiences.\n- **Impact on Daily Life:** There is a clear pattern of avoidance behaviors (Q8) and social withdrawal (Q20), likely due to fear of having panic attacks in public or in front of others.\n- **Emotional Regulation:** The patient reports irritability (Q3) and difficulty managing emotions, particularly in the context of anxiety and after panic attacks.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low interest/pleasure (Q1), feelings of depression/hopelessness (Q2), and social withdrawal (Q20) may indicate depression.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Persistent anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) are indicative of an anxiety disorder, potentially Panic Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Though not directly indicated, the presence of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors could suggest PTSD if trauma is a factor.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The presence of thoughts about hurting oneself (Q11) without a plan is a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to excess or without a prescription (Q21-23), the thought of using something to calm down during an attack (A23) could indicate a risk for future substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, with panic attacks being a central feature. These symptoms have impacted daily functioning, leading to social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan is concerning and warrants immediate attention. Sleep disturbances and physical symptoms during panic attacks further contribute to the patient's distress. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to determine the specific mental health conditions and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Diagnosis Considerations:** \n\n- **Panic Disorder:** Recurrent panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder:** Persistent depressed mood or loss of interest.\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Generalized anxiety or fear that interferes with daily life.\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:** \n\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly panic-focused CBT.\n- Pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression and anxiety.\n- Safety planning and close monitoring of suicidal ideation.\n\nThis clinical summary highlights the need for a detailed diagnostic assessment and the development of a tailored treatment plan to address the patient's complex mental health needs.",
