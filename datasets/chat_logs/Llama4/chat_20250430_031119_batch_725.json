However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the appropriate symptoms.",

The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use, and maintained a coherent conversational arc throughout the assessment.",

The therapist explicitly linked each diagnostic decision to specific DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive justification for the diagnoses. The presence of suicidal ideation was also appropriately noted as a serious concern requiring immediate attention.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly impersonal or abrupt. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation before transitioning to the next question.
