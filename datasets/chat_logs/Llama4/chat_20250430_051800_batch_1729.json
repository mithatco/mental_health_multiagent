I haven't really felt like doing much of anything lately.\"</quote>. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. Your symptoms of anxiety, fear, and irritability are understandable, especially given your history. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported, align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>negative changes in mood and cognition</sym> (Q1, Q2). Additionally, the patient's symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep and appetite</sym> meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> (Q3) may be related to both conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms, focusing on coping skills and managing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan for <med>MDD</med>, incorporating <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to monitor <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and identify potential triggers for <sym>nightmares</sym>.\n4. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n5. Consider <med>referral to a specialist</med>, such as a <med>trauma-informed therapist</med>, to provide additional support and guidance.",
