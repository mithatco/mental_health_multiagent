          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and related distress. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1), feelings of sadness and hopelessness (Q2), and a general sense of disconnection.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Increased irritability (Q3), persistent worry and anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Excessive sleep but feeling tired (Q4) and overall poor sleep quality (Q14).\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains (Q9) and physical tension, particularly in the shoulders and neck.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** Difficulty concentrating, memory issues (Q15), and intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n- **Existential and Relational Distress:** Feelings of detachment (Q18), uncertainty about identity and life goals (Q19), and strained relationships (Q20).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Pervasive Anxiety:** The patient's responses indicate a high level of anxiety that permeates many aspects of their life, including work, personal relationships, and daily activities.\n- **Depressive Affect:** A significant theme of depression, including anhedonia, low mood, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** Avoidance of activities and situations due to anxiety, which may reinforce feelings of isolation and disconnection.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Reports of physical tension, aches, and pains, which could be somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry, anxiety, and physical symptoms associated with worry.\n- **Panic Disorder:** Recurring panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Avoidance behaviors and significant distress in social and occupational functioning.\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Reports of excessive sleep and poor quality sleep.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** While the patient denies thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), the presence of significant depressive and anxiety symptoms requires ongoing assessment for suicidality.\n- **Substance Use:** Although the patient denies misuse of prescribed medications or use of illicit substances (Q23), previous use of marijuana for relaxation indicates potential coping mechanisms that might not be adaptive.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and possible major depressive disorder. The presence of pervasive worry, physical symptoms, sleep disturbances, and avoidance behaviors suggests a complex clinical presentation that warrants a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment planning. The patient's reports of feeling disconnected from activities, others, and themselves highlight the need for interventions aimed at improving mood, reducing anxiety, enhancing coping strategies, and fostering a sense of identity and connection. \n\n**DSM-5 Diagnosis Considerations:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder.\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication evaluation for depression and anxiety, sleep hygiene practices, and coping skills training. \n\n**Follow-Up:** Regular follow-up sessions to monitor symptoms, assess for suicidality, and adjust treatment as necessary.",
