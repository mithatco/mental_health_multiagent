Their symptoms are primarily related to social interactions and performance, leading to avoidance and distress. The patient's reports suggest potential diagnoses of Social Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these impressions and develop an effective treatment plan. Ongoing monitoring of suicidal ideation and substance use is essential.",

Additionally, the patient's <quote>\"avoiding situations that make me anxious\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like I'm missing out on deep connections\"</quote> suggest significant distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2.
