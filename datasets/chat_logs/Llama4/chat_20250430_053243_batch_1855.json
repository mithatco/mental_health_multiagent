Additionally, your reports of feeling <sym>down and depressed</sym> and having <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> suggest that <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> may also be present. The co-occurrence of these symptoms is not uncommon, and a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is needed to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>OCD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3.

Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, as well as their <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>sleep patterns</sym>.\n5. Offer <med>family therapy</med> to help the patient's family understand their condition and provide support.",
