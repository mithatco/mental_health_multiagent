I'm here to support you, and I'm using a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to help us understand your current mental health. This questionnaire will ask you about your experiences over the past two weeks. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Anxiety and worry (Q6, Q7, Q8)\n- Somatic symptoms (Q9)\n- Cognitive difficulties (Q15)\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11) - passive, not active\n- Feelings of detachment and questioning identity (Q18, Q19)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of negative affect, including sadness, irritability, and anxiety.\n- Significant impairment in functioning, including social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors.\n- Reports of cognitive difficulties, including concentration and memory issues.\n- Endorsement of both internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing symptoms (e.g., irritability).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt (not directly asked but inferred).\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms of anxiety, worry, panic, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Endorsement of recurrent and multiple somatic complaints.\n- **Adjustment Disorder:** Given the recent significant life change and the patient's response to it.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports passive suicidal ideation (wanting to escape or disappear), which indicates a need for careful assessment and monitoring.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies use, but this should be monitored as a potential coping mechanism.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture suggestive of co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders, likely precipitated by a recent significant life change. The patient reports substantial distress across various symptom domains, including affective, cognitive, and behavioral. The presence of passive suicidal ideation necessitates a thorough risk assessment and consideration of immediate safety planning. The clinical impression supports the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of depressive, anxiety, and adjustment disorders. Intervention strategies might include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, IPT), potential pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety symptoms, and close monitoring of suicidal ideation. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic evaluation.\n- Development of a treatment plan tailored to address the patient's specific symptoms and concerns.\n- Regular follow-up to assess treatment response and adjust the plan as necessary.\n- Immediate attention to safety planning given the presence of passive suicidal ideation.",
