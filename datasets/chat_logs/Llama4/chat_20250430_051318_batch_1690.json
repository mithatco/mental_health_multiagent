You're experiencing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like feeling down, hopeless, and irritable, which can be really tough to navigate. You're also dealing with <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including panic attacks, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> that are unwanted and distressing. It's clear that these experiences are impacting your relationships and overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and we'll work together to find ways to address these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> should be considered.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses suggest a pattern of internalizing symptoms, including <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive symptoms</sym>. The endorsement of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not intent to act, warrants concern and further assessment. The patient's experiences of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> are consistent with <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> meets criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, respectively.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence and nature of any underlying mental health conditions.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n3. <med>Medications</med>, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRI</med>s, may be considered to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med>, such as <med>mindfulness</med> or <med>deep breathing</med>, to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
