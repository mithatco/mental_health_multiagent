The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, etc., and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally align with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'sleep problems,' the therapist could have been more specific about types of sleep disturbances. However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively built on the patient's disclosures to guide the conversation. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, and the therapist followed up on concerning disclosures appropriately.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to support the diagnoses of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments where the language seemed slightly formal or technical. For example, when discussing 'dissociation,' the therapist could have been more emotionally attuned. However, the therapist generally acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a comprehensive and empathetic approach to assessing the patient's mental health using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, showed a logical flow in questioning, and provided clear diagnostic justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was strong.",
