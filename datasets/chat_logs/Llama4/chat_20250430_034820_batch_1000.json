This tool helps us identify areas that might need further exploration and ensures we address any concerns you may have. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Depressive symptoms, irritability, and emotional dysregulation are also reported. The patient's responses suggest potential areas of clinical significance related to anxiety and depressive disorders. Further evaluation and exploration are necessary to determine the presence and severity of these symptoms. The patient's cautious approach to substance use and absence of suicidal ideation are noted. Overall, the patient's symptoms suggest a need for targeted interventions to address social anxiety, emotional regulation, and depressive symptoms.",
