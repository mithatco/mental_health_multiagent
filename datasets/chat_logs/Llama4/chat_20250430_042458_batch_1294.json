The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Reports a diminished interest in activities (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), particularly during panic attacks.\n- Experiences irritability (Q3) and anxiety (Q6), with frequent panic attacks (Q7) and avoidance of situations that may trigger anxiety (Q8).\n- Physical complaints include aches and pains (Q9), stomach issues, and chest pains without a medical explanation.\n- Endorses thoughts of self-harm (Q11) but denies intent or plan.\n- Reports sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14), concentration and memory problems (Q15), and recurrent, intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n- Exhibits compulsive behaviors (Q17) and feelings of detachment (Q18) and identity confusion (Q19).\n- Social withdrawal and relationship difficulties (Q20).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and panic symptoms, including panic attacks, fear of having attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- Co-occurring depressive symptoms, such as diminished pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability.\n- Physical symptoms that do not have a clear medical explanation.\n- Significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms align with panic disorder, possibly with agoraphobia given the avoidance of places and situations.\n- **Depressive Disorders:** Presence of depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders:** Unexplained physical symptoms.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders:** Repetitive behaviors and thoughts.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Endorses thoughts of hurting self (Q11), indicating a need for careful assessment of suicide risk.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies misuse of substances (Q21-23), which is positive but should be monitored.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by prominent symptoms of anxiety (panic attacks, generalized anxiety) and depression (diminished interest, feelings of hopelessness). The presence of panic attacks, significant avoidance behaviors, and compulsive behaviors are particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the patient reports a range of somatic complaints without medical explanation. The endorsement of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment. Overall, the clinical presentation suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, likely involving both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Close monitoring of suicide risk and coordination of care with other healthcare providers, as needed, is recommended.",

You mentioned feeling like you're walking on eggshells, worried about having another attack, and it's affecting your relationships and daily life. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and it's understandable that you're feeling lost and unsure about how to manage these feelings. <quote>\"I feel like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen.\"</quote> Your concerns about your physical health and the fear that there's something more going on that's not being addressed are also valid.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, given the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, fear of having more attacks, and significant avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding crowded places, public transportation). The presence of <sym>agoraphobia</sym> is suggested by the patient's avoidance of situations or places due to fear of having a panic attack. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as diminished interest in activities and feelings of hopelessness, suggests a possible co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. However, the primary clinical concern appears to be the <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and to assess for co-occurring conditions, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>agoraphobia</sym>, and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Development of a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
