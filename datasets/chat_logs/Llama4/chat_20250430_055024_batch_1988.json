      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities that once brought you joy. You've described feeling like you're walking around with a cloud of sadness following you, and it's hard to find pleasure in things that used to make you happy. You're also experiencing anxiety, irritability, and trouble sleeping. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with your emotions. Your reports of headaches, stomachaches, and feeling \"on edge\" suggest that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>irritability</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>nervousness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations also suggest a high level of anxious distress. The <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and anxiety.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5.
