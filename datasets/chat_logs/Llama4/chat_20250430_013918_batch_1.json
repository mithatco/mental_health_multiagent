This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's <quote>\"constant cloud of worry and dread\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like I'm always bracing for something bad to happen\"</quote> suggest a persistent and excessive worry that is characteristic of <med>GAD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> management.\n2. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to help with <sym>relaxation</sym> and <sym>stress reduction</sym>.\n3. Referral to a psychiatrist for potential <med>pharmacological interventions</med> to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>\"worry journal\"</quote> to track <sym>anxiety</sym> triggers and patterns.\n5. Explore <med>relaxation techniques</med> such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n6.
