        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'hearing voices,' the therapist followed up with questions about the frequency and impact of these symptoms. Similarly, the therapist explored the patient's feelings of depression, anxiety, and cognitive difficulties in detail.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'compared to usual' to better align with DSM-5 terminology. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted the patient's symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively used the patient's disclosures to guide subsequent inquiries. For instance, after the patient mentioned feeling 'on edge,' the therapist asked about anxiety symptoms, demonstrating a coherent and responsive approach.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder is clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which include depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, psychotic symptoms (hearing voices, feeling like people can read minds), cognitive difficulties, and sleep disturbances. The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to the DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive rationale for the diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a professional tone, but there were moments where the interactions seemed slightly formal or abrupt. For example, when the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist could have offered more immediate emotional support or acknowledgment of distress before transitioning to the next question."

      "overall_comments": "Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong ability to systematically assess the patient's symptoms using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. The conversation was well-structured, and the therapist showed empathy and professionalism. However, minor areas for improvement include refining clinical phrasing and providing more immediate emotional support during sensitive disclosures. The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder was well-supported by the patient's symptoms, and the recommended next steps were comprehensive and appropriate.",
