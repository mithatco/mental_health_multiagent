Depressive and anxiety symptoms are prominent, and the patient reports a history of traumatic experiences. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as coping mechanisms are concerning and warrant immediate attention. The patient's sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and cognitive difficulties further support the need for comprehensive assessment and intervention. A diagnostic evaluation for trauma- and stressor-related disorders, depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders is warranted. Clinical attention should focus on addressing the patient's immediate risk factors, developing a treatment plan to address their symptoms, and enhancing coping skills.",
