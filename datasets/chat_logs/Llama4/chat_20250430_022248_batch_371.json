The patient's symptoms have significantly impacted their daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. The clinical interview and questionnaire responses highlight the need for further evaluation and potential treatment of PTSD, MDD, and anxiety disorders. Additionally, the patient's substance use and suicidal ideation warrant close monitoring and potential intervention.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling with a range of difficult emotions and experiences since the accident. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> has been a big problem for you. You also shared that you're feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> a lot, and that <sym>anxiety</sym> is something you're dealing with on a daily basis. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported on the questionnaire, suggest a strong possibility of <med>PTSD</med> given the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to the accident, as well as <sym>hypervigilance</sym>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>low interest</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations</sym>, also support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <quote>I'm not sure if I'm getting the help I need</quote>, so I recommend that we work together to develop a treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and goals.\n2. I suggest that we consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to help you manage your <sym>PTSD</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. We can also explore <med>medication options</med> to help alleviate your <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. I encourage you to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track your experiences and identify patterns that may be helpful in our treatment planning.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.",
