You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that nothing seems fun anymore. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, and that <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> have been affecting your overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'll do my best to help you work through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a strong possibility of <med>PTSD</med>, given your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to a traumatic event. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>nightmares</sym> and <sym>physical tension</sym> you reported may also be indicative of <med>PTSD</med>. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of your trauma history and current symptoms.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> to address your <sym>PTSD</sym> symptoms and <sym>depressive symptoms</med>.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</med>.\n4. Develop a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve your <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Consider <med>group therapy</med> or <med>support groups</med> to provide additional social support and connection.",
