Their reports of emotional pain, avoidance behaviors, and self-doubt suggest significant distress and impairment. The presence of suicidal ideation and emotional distress highlights the need for careful risk assessment and crisis management. Further evaluation and diagnostic assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.",

It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your relationships and overall well-being. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're experiencing a range of physical and emotional symptoms that are distressing and impairing your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>fatigue</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, their reports of <sym>worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym> suggest co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms. The patient's <quote>feelings of emptiness</quote> and <quote>not feeling close to other people</quote> also support this diagnostic impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>MDD</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms and improve sleep quality.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and improve mood.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
