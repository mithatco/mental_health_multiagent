They express feelings of persistent worry, fear, and anxiety, often accompanied by <sym>panic attacks</sym> and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The patient notes difficulty concentrating and enjoying activities they once found pleasure in, alongside <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> due to constant worry.

Their reports of <sym>persistent worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> or <med>Panic Disorder</med>.

The presence of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>increased irritability</sym>, and <sym>physical manifestations of anxiety</sym> further support these diagnostic considerations.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough clinical interview and potentially utilize standardized assessment tools to confirm the presence of <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Depressive Disorders</med>.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <quote>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</quote> or <quote>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</quote> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Evaluate the need for <quote>antidepressants</quote> or <quote>anxiolytics</quote> under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Practices:** Educate the patient on <quote>sleep hygiene</quote> techniques to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. **Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
