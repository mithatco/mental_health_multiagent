Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: **Clinical Observation Summary**\n\n**Patient's Presentation:** The patient presents with a complex clinical profile, primarily characterized by anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n**Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n1. **Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient reports experiencing frequent panic attacks, persistent worry about having another panic attack, and fear of losing control. They endorse feeling nervous, anxious, and on edge most of the time (Q6), and experience panic attacks that are terrifying (Q7).\n2. **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and expresses concerns about their future, feeling like they will never be able to control their panic attacks.\n3. **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient experiences sleep problems due to constant worry about panic attacks (Q14).\n4. **Irritability and Social Withdrawal:** The patient reports increased irritability (Q3) and social withdrawal due to feelings of being a burden to others (Q20).\n\n**Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- **Anxiety and Fear:** A pervasive pattern of anxiety and fear is evident across multiple responses, particularly concerning panic attacks and their consequences.\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** The patient avoids situations that might trigger panic attacks (Q8), leading to social isolation and withdrawal.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** The patient experiences various physical symptoms during and after panic attacks, including heart pounding, sweating, and chest pain (Q9).\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n1. **Anxiety Disorders:** The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of an anxiety disorder, possibly Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, given the avoidance of places and situations that might trigger panic attacks.\n2. **Major Depressive Disorder:** The presence of persistent feelings of hopelessness, depression, and social withdrawal suggests potential comorbidity with Major Depressive Disorder.\n3. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the experience of panic attacks and persistent fear could be related to a traumatic event.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n1. **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves when feeling overwhelmed (Q11), indicating a significant risk factor for suicide.\n2. **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to self-medicate (Q21-Q23), the presence of substance use as a coping mechanism should be monitored.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile dominated by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Key concerns include frequent panic attacks, persistent worry, and fear of losing control, alongside feelings of hopelessness and depression. Sleep disturbances, irritability, and social withdrawal are also prominent. The presence of suicidal ideation and avoidance behaviors highlights the need for immediate intervention. Comprehensive assessment and treatment planning are warranted to address these clinical concerns, focusing on anxiety management, depression, and suicidal risk.\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n1. **In-depth Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of specific disorders, such as Panic Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and potential PTSD.\n2. **Crisis Intervention:** Address the patient's suicidal ideation through crisis intervention and risk management strategies.\n3. **Development of a Treatment Plan:** Create a tailored treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT for anxiety and depression), medication (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications), and coping strategies to manage panic attacks and improve quality of life.",

You mentioned that it's hard to find pleasure in things you used to enjoy, and you're feeling down and hopeless about your future. You feel like you're losing control and that these <sym>panic attacks</sym> are taking over your life. <quote>\"I just feel so anxious all the time, and it's hard to shake off this feeling of hopelessness.\"</quote> I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, as evidenced by recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, persistent worry about having another attack, and <sym>agoraphobia</sym> (avoidance of places and situations that might trigger panic). The patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including feeling down, hopeless, and loss of interest in activities, suggest comorbidity with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports the need for immediate intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a crisis intervention plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's safety.\n3. Implement a treatment plan that includes <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anti-anxiety medications</med> to help manage symptoms.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track <sym>panic attacks</sym> and identify triggers.\n6. Develop a <sym>self-care plan</sym> to improve sleep quality, increase social support, and enhance overall well-being.",
