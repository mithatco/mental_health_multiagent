This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You feel like you're constantly on edge, and it's hard for you to enjoy things you used to love. You mentioned feeling <quote>\"like my mind is always elsewhere\"</quote>, and it's like your brain is constantly scanning for threats. I can imagine how exhausting and frustrating that must be for you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>GAD</med>, which is characterized by excessive and persistent <sym>worry</sym> about everyday things, even when there's no apparent reason to worry. The patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic moments</sym> (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8) support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14), <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3), and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> (Q9) are common comorbidities with <med>GAD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> patterns.\n2. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered to help regulate mood and reduce <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Regular exercise and physical activity to help reduce <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. Further evaluation and assessment to rule out other potential diagnoses, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>.",
