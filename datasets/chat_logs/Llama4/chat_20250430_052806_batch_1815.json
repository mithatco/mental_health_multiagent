You mentioned feeling \"down\" and \"hopeless\" a lot of the time, and that it's hard to explain, but it feels like nothing matters. These feelings are clearly overwhelming and affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. It's completely understandable to feel this way, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, including <sym>persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's reports of <quote>feeling empty most of the time</quote> and <quote>it's like nothing matters</quote> suggest a pervasive negative affect, which is a hallmark of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>worry</sym> and <sym>fear</sym>, may be comorbid with <med>MDD</med> or suggest a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, psychological questionnaires, and a detailed medical and mental health history, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) may be effective in addressing <med>MDD</med> symptoms and improving coping skills.\n3. Pharmacological interventions: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other antidepressants may be prescribed to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices: Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine may help improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. Social support: Encouraging the patient to connect with friends, family, or support groups to help build social connections and reduce feelings of isolation.",
