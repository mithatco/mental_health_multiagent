Each question was addressed with appropriate follow-up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The conversation systematically covered depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other key domains.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'problems with memory,' the therapist could have been more specific about types of memory issues (e.g., learning new information, recalling familiar words). Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from more precision in a few areas.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and maintained a coherent conversational arc throughout the assessment.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist effectively linked specific symptoms (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms, psychotic features) to the DSM-5 criteria for Schizoaffective Disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interaction felt slightly impersonal or overly technical. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation and support. Overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's distress."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing the patient's mental health across various DSM-5 domains. The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language in some questions and enhanced emotional validation, the overall performance was strong.",
