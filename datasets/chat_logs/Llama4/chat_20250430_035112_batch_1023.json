The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and ensured that the conversation remained coherent and focused.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which aligned closely with DSM-5 criteria. The therapist explicitly linked specific symptoms to the diagnostic decision, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the patient's presentation.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the tone seemed slightly impersonal or overly technical. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional and empathetic tone throughout the conversation."
