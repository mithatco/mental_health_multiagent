However, some areas could have been explored in greater depth, and a few questions were phrased vaguely or seemed to lack follow-up. For instance, questions about psychotic symptoms (items 12 and 13) were quickly dismissed by the patient, and substance use (items 21-23) was not thoroughly explored beyond 'I've tried some stuff' and 'I drink socially'. Still, the therapist made an effort to cover a wide range of symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were moments where the phrasing was slightly off or lacked specificity. For example, the question about feeling down was straightforward, but inquiries about sleep disturbances and substance use could have been more precise. The therapist mostly used clinically accurate language but occasionally used vague terms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few abrupt transitions, such as moving from discussing irritability to sleep disturbances without a clear connection. The therapist mostly maintained a coherent conversational arc but could have improved with more transitional phrases or summaries.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety and Substance Use concerns was generally supported by the patient's symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like feeling down, irritability, and anxiety to the diagnosis. However, the justification could have been stronger with more detailed explanations of how each symptom aligned with DSM-5 criteria and consideration of alternative diagnoses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. However, there were moments where the therapist's responses seemed somewhat formulaic or could have been more personalized. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling detached from themselves, the therapist could have explored this symptom more deeply."

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a mix of emotions, from feeling <sym>down</sym> and <sym>irritable</sym> to experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>. You mentioned that you try to avoid situations that make you anxious, and you're experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym>. You also shared that you sometimes feel like people don't understand you, and you're struggling with your identity and life goals. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> and <med>Substance Use</med> concerns.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (feeling down, irritability, sleep disturbances), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (panic, anxiety, avoidance behaviors), and potential <med>substance use concerns</med> (using substances without a doctor's prescription, drinking socially). Your reports of feeling detached from yourself and uncertain about your identity and life goals also suggest <med>emotional dysregulation</med>. While your symptoms do not perfectly align with a single diagnosis, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> appears to be a primary concern, with <med>anxiety</med> and <med>substance use</med> concerns being secondary.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and assess the severity of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2.

Exploration of coping mechanisms and stress management techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. Referral to a <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment program to address potential <med>substance use concerns</med>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
