          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports feeling disconnected from activities they used to enjoy (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and having decreased motivation.\n- **Irritability and Anger:** Increased irritability and anger, as evidenced by snapping at people more often (Q3).\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Sleeping more than usual as a means to escape thoughts and feelings (Q4).\n- **Anxiety:** Constant feelings of worry (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Reports of back pain and headaches attributed to stress (Q9).\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Endorses thoughts of hurting themselves and feeling like a burden (Q11).\n- **Substance Use:** Use of prescription painkillers and marijuana to cope (Q23).\n- **Cognitive and Emotional Difficulties:** Problems with memory (Q15), intrusive thoughts (Q16), compulsive substance use (Q17), and feelings of detachment (Q18).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Mood and Affective Symptoms:** The patient exhibits a pattern of depressive symptoms (e.g., loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness) alongside anxiety symptoms (e.g., constant worry, panic attacks).\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** Avoidance of both internal distress (through substance use and excessive sleeping) and external situations (avoiding crowds and social gatherings).\n- **Self-Coping Mechanisms:** The patient seems to rely on maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance use and avoidance.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms align with potential diagnosis of MDD, including depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** The presence of excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors could suggest an anxiety disorder.\n- **Substance Use Disorder (SUD):** The patient's use of substances to cope and in greater amounts than prescribed indicates potential SUD.\n- **Risk of Suicide:** The endorsement of suicidal ideation without intent or plan requires careful assessment and monitoring.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Thoughts of hurting oneself indicate a significant risk that needs immediate attention and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use:** Using prescription medications without a prescription and using marijuana could indicate a risk for SUD and potential for overdose or other substance-related complications.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by significant depressive symptoms, anxiety, substance use, and suicidal ideation. The pattern of avoidance and use of maladaptive coping strategies suggests a need for comprehensive treatment planning. Key areas for focus include mood stabilization, management of anxiety, addressing substance use, and ensuring safety from suicide. A multifaceted approach, potentially including medication and therapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy), could be beneficial. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and coordination of care to address the patient's complex needs are essential. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:** Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder), Substance Use Disorder, and possible co-occurring mental health conditions given the breadth of symptoms. \n\n**Treatment Recommendations:** Further evaluation, including a detailed diagnostic interview and possibly additional assessments (e.g., suicide risk assessment), is necessary to guide a treatment plan tailored to the patient's specific needs. \n\n**Confidentiality and Follow-Up:** Given the sensitive nature of the information shared, maintaining confidentiality while ensuring safety and providing support is crucial. Follow-up sessions should focus on building a therapeutic relationship, exploring coping strategies, and addressing immediate risk factors.",
