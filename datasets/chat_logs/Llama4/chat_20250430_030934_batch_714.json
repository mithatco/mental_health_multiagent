I'm here to support you, and I'm using a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a 23-question assessment that will help us identify areas that might be concerning and guide our conversation. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking one question at a time, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
