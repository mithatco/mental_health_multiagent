I've been going through the motions, but it's all felt pretty empty</quote>. You're also carrying a heavy emotional burden, feeling down and hopeless about the future. <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> are clearly affecting your daily life, making it hard to sleep, focus, and connect with others. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what's ahead.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, <med>DSM-5</med> code: 296.32\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as indicated by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, and difficulties in concentration. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> suggests anxious distress. The patient's report of <quote>feeling like I'm just going through the motions</quote> and <quote>not knowing who I am anymore</quote> also supports this diagnosis. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> could be considered due to the patient's physical complaints, the primary symptoms appear to be related to mood and anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them joy and help them connect with others, such as social support groups or hobbies.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Consider <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices and stress management techniques to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.",
