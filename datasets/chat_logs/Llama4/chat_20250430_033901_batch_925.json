The assessment I'm about to administer is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in as much detail as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
