      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a lot of emotional pain, feeling disconnected from things that used to bring you joy, and experiencing a range of distressing symptoms. You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and that little things can set you off. You're also struggling with sleep, and using substances to cope. It takes a lot of courage to share these struggles, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported on the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, suggest a complex clinical profile. The patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7), and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) are significant concerns. The patient's reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and <sym>substance use</sym> (Q23) also necessitate attention. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and risk assessment are necessary to inform treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnoses of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>.\n3. Consideration of <med>psychotherapy</med> and <med>pharmacotherapy</med> to address the patient's symptoms.\n4. Regular check-ins to monitor the patient's symptoms, treatment progress, and risk factors, such as <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5. Encouragement of healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, mindfulness, or creative activities, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.",
