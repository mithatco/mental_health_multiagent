The therapist did not skip any dimensions and provided appropriate follow-up questions based on the patient's responses.",

The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The questions were phrased in a way that directly assessed the patient's symptoms and experiences, allowing for a clear understanding of their mental health status. There were no noticeable inaccuracies or vague phrasing in the questions asked.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics based on the patient's disclosures. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, and the therapist appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Social Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) clearly aligned with the patient's responses to the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as feelings of nervousness and anxiety in social situations (Q6, Q7, Q8) and reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and experiencing a decrease in pleasure in activities (Q1). The justification for the diagnoses was clinically sound and directly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style, maintaining an appropriate professional tone throughout the interaction. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, expressing understanding and support. For example, the therapist noted, 'I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.' The interaction was personalized, and the therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, creating a safe and supportive environment for the patient to share their experiences."
