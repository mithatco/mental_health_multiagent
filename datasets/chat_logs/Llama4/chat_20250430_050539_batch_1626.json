Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your mental health.

We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's start with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
