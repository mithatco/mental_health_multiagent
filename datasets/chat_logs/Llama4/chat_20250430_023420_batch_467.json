I'm using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire to help us understand your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a self-rated tool that will help us identify areas that might be impacting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
