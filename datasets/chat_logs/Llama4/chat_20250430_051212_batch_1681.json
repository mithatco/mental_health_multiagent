This tool helps us identify any mental health concerns you might be experiencing. I want to assure you that everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
