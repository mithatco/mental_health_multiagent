You've shared feelings of deep sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in things that used to bring you joy. <quote>It's been hard to find joy in anything since my divorce</quote>. Your sleep has been affected, and you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry. You're also dealing with physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, which can be really frustrating. It's clear that you're struggling and feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The recent divorce appears to be a significant contributing factor to these symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> thoughts and behaviors.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, may be considered in conjunction with therapy.\n3. Development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n4. Encouragement of self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage symptoms.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
