You've shared that <quote>it's like I'm just going through the motions</quote>, and that <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> has become a regular part of your life. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your relationships, daily activities, and overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I'll do my best to help you find a way forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest significant <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, which are often comorbid with <med>MDD</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> reported, although without a plan, warrants careful consideration and monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview and evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. Encouragement of self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage stress and improve mood.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Consideration of <med>trauma-informed care</med> if further evaluation suggests a history of trauma.",
