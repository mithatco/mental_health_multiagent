The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2, Q11)\n* Anxiety symptoms (Q6, Q7, Q8)\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n* Cognitive difficulties (Q15)\n* Suicidal ideation (Q11)\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal thoughts (Q11: \"sometimes I think about not being here\")\n* Increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders\n* Potential for substance use as a coping mechanism (Q23: wishes for a medication to alleviate symptoms)\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression, including depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness. Anxiety symptoms are also prominent, with reports of nervousness, worry, and fear. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties are also noted. The patient's responses suggest a high level of distress and impairment in daily life. Suicidal ideation is a concern, although no plan or intent is reported. Overall, the patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, possibly with anxious distress. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan.",

The presence of <sym>anxious distress</sym> is also evident, as indicated by symptoms of <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>fear</sym>. The patient's <quote>feelings of hopelessness</quote> and <quote>thoughts of not being here</quote> suggest a risk of suicidal ideation, although no plan or intent is reported.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3.
