Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your symptoms. This is a standard tool that helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The justification was sound and referenced DSM-5 criteria, providing a clear link between the patient's symptoms and the proposed diagnosis.",

The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state.
