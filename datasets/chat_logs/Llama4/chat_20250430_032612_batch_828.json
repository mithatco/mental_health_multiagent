      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a lot of pain and distress lately. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and it's like you're just going through the motions. You've also been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a weight on you all the time. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and it's affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with co-occurring <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>posttraumatic stress</sym>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>hyperarousal</sym> (Q6, Q7) are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q1), and <sym>decreased energy</sym> (Q4) meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <quote>\"weight on me all the time\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like I'm just going through the motions\"</quote> suggest a significant impact on daily life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>PTSD</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> symptoms.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, to help manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to monitor their sleep patterns and identify potential triggers for <sym>insomnia</sym>.\n5. Consider <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> or <med>eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)</med> therapy to address <sym>PTSD</sym> symptoms.",
