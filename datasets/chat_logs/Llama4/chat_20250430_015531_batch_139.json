Cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, and social relationship challenges are also reported. The patient endorses some obsessive-compulsive symptoms and substance use. While suicidal ideation is not reported, the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms warrants close monitoring. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the presence and severity of potential mental health conditions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nA comprehensive diagnostic interview and potential psychological assessments (e.g., mood, anxiety, and substance use disorder screenings) are recommended to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and concerns. A treatment plan addressing the patient's specific needs and risk factors should be developed.",

The therapist generally covered 20 out of 23 questions, missing or skimming only a few domains.",

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'but still have a lot of energy' to better align with the DSM-5 criteria. Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly moved from one topic to another without fully exploring the patient's initial response. For example, after the patient mentioned 'memory can be a bit fuzzy sometimes,' the therapist quickly moved to 'unpleasant thoughts' without further probing on cognitive difficulties.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Disorder features clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like feeling down, irritated, and anxious to the diagnosis. However, the justification could have been stronger by discussing rule-outs or alternative diagnoses, such as Somatic Symptom Disorder, which was mentioned but not fully explored.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy and a professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and offered support. For example, 'It's clear that you're going through a tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.' However, there were minor moments where the interaction felt slightly robotic or impersonal, such as when rapidly moving through certain questions."
