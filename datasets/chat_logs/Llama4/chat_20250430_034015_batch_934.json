This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images that repeatedly enter your mind,' the therapist probed further to understand the nature and impact of these thoughts.",

The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for 'mania,' the therapist asked about 'sleeping less than usual, but still have a lot of energy,' which directly maps to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. For example, after the patient discussed 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' the therapist logically transitioned to questions about 'anxiety' and 'sleep disturbances,' which are commonly comorbid with depressive symptoms.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of 'Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified' was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms, which included periods of depression and hypomania. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic decision to specific DSM-5 criteria, such as 'mood instability' and 'fluctuating mood.' The reasoning provided was clinically sound and transparent.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The interactions were professional, yet warm and personalized. For instance, when the patient shared their struggles with motivation and interest, the therapist responded with understanding and support, creating a safe space for the patient to explore their feelings."
