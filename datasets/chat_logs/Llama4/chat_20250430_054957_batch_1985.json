Additionally, the therapist could have probed further into the patient's responses regarding suicidal ideation (item 11) and substance use (items 21-23). Despite these minor omissions, the therapist covered a wide range of symptoms.",

For example, the question about 'sleeping less than usual' (item 4) could have been more precisely worded to align with DSM-5 terminology. However, the therapist's questions were largely clinically relevant and targeted the patient's symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few moments where the conversation could have benefited from smoother transitions. For instance, after the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have immediately followed up with more probing questions to ensure safety. Overall, the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety and suicidal ideation clearly align with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The justification was clinically sound and directly linked to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and maintained an appropriate professional tone throughout the conversation. The use of phrases like 'Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to not be okay' demonstrated a high level of empathy and understanding."
