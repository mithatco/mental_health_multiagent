I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> provisional.\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align with <med>GAD</med> due to excessive worry, fear, and anxiety that interfere with daily life, as well as physical symptoms like tension and aches. Their depressive symptoms, such as <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym>, suggest <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> further support these diagnoses. A comprehensive evaluation is needed to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a more in-depth evaluation to confirm the diagnoses and discuss treatment options.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3.
