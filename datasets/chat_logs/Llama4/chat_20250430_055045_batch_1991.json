This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of decreased interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and sleep disturbances suggest a depressive episode. The presence of panic attacks, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors suggest an anxiety disorder, potentially PTSD. The patient's use of marijuana as a coping mechanism and reports of suicidal ideation highlight the need for immediate attention and support.
