We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

For example, when asking about psychotic symptoms, the therapist could have used more precise language to capture the patient's experiences. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the patient's symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and effectively followed up on concerning disclosures. For instance, when the patient mentioned hearing voices, the therapist explored this symptom further and linked it to the psychotic symptoms domain.",

The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as low mood, anhedonia, and psychotic symptoms, to justify the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety and psychotic symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there are minor moments where the interactions seem slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist could have offered more immediate emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and acknowledged the patient's distress."
