The predominant symptoms include persistent worry, panic, depressed mood, reduced interest in activities, sleep disturbances, irritability, and physical complaints. These symptoms interfere substantially with daily functioning, social relationships, and overall well-being. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possibly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of a treatment plan addressing these areas are warranted. The patient's report of feeling like a burden and experiencing anxiety severe enough to consider professional help indicates a need for supportive and possibly therapeutic interventions to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",
