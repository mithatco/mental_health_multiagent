This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and you can share your experiences with me. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll make sure to guide you through the process. Let's get started. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
