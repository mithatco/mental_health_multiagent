This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of nervousness and anxiety in social situations, which makes it difficult for you to enjoy activities and interact with others. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying social gatherings or parties. You also experience physical symptoms like blushing, sweating, and a shaky voice in these situations. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and behaviors align with <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>, characterized by persistent difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication for social purposes. The patient's reports of feeling nervous, anxious, and fearful in social situations (Q6, Q7), avoidance of social situations (Q8), and physical symptoms like blushing and sweating (Q9) support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's intrusive thoughts (Q16) and difficulties in forming close relationships (Q20) are consistent with this condition.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>.\n2. Social skills training to improve <sym>verbal and nonverbal communication</sym> in social situations.\n3. Exposure therapy to gradually expose the patient to feared social situations, reducing <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n4. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym> in social situations.\n5. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to rule out other potential diagnoses, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.",
