The patient's reports of sleep disturbances, intrusive thoughts, and emotional regulation difficulties further support the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. The clinician should consider assessing for MDD, Anxiety Disorders, and PTSD, and explore the patient's coping mechanisms, social support, and daily functioning. A thorough diagnostic interview and potential additional assessments are warranted to determine the patient's specific needs and develop an effective treatment plan.",

You also shared that you get nervous and worried about what others think of you, which makes you feel <quote>\"on edge\"</quote>. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>social anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling <quote>\"down\"</quote> and <quote>\"hopeless\"</quote> in social situations, as well as their <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for both disorders, and further evaluation is needed to determine the severity and impact of these conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of symptoms.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3.
