You've shared that things that used to bring you joy no longer seem enjoyable, and you're struggling with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Your sleep has been affected, and you're experiencing <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>concentration problems</sym>. You're also worried about your future, finances, and relationships with loved ones. It's clear that you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to move forward.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient reports experiencing <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> for an extended period, along with changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, and concentration problems. These symptoms are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's recent divorce may be a contributing factor to these symptoms, suggesting a possible <med>adjustment disorder</med> or <med>post-traumatic stress disorder</med> (PTSD) related to the traumatic event.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive symptoms and coping skills.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Develop a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve sleep hygiene, increase physical activity, and enhance overall well-being.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
