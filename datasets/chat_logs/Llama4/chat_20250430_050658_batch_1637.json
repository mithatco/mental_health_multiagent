You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a weight on your shoulders that you can't shake off. It's clear that anxiety and fear are also significant concerns for you, with reports of panic attacks and a constant sense of being on edge. You've shared that you've been experiencing physical tension and pain, and that you've been having trouble sleeping. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I'll do my best to help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, with <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>increased irritability</sym> consistent with <med>depressive disorders</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are indicative of <med>anxiety disorders</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>nightmares</sym> related to a traumatic event (implied by your responses) suggest <med>PTSD</med>. Your <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. <med>Trauma-focused CBT</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms and help you process your traumatic experience.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene</med> practices and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
