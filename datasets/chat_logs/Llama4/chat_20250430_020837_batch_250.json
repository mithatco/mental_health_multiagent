This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your well-being and treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest a potential diagnosis of an anxiety disorder.
