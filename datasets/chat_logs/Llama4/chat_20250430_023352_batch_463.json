Your <quote>interest in activities has been tough</quote> and you've been experiencing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident. It's clear that this event has had a profound impact on your life, affecting your relationships, work, and overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to support you and help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about the accident (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (Q6), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2, Q11) and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7) may be comorbid conditions that require attention. The patient's use of alcohol to aid sleep (Q21) may be a coping mechanism, but also poses a risk for <med>substance use disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> and assess for comorbid conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>trauma-focused CBT</med>, to address the patient's <sym>PTSD symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>medication</med> options, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med>, to help manage the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>stress management techniques</med>, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises, to help cope with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>hypervigilance</sym>.\n5. Monitor the patient's <med>substance use</med> and provide guidance on healthy coping mechanisms to reduce the risk of <med>substance use disorder</med>.",
