      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a deep sense of emptiness and disconnection from things that used to bring you joy. You mentioned feeling like a heavy cloud is following you around, and some days are harder than others. You also shared that you're irritable, have trouble sleeping, and often feel anxious or on edge. Hearing voices and feeling like people can hear your thoughts are really distressing for you. You feel disconnected from yourself and others, and sometimes wonder if things will ever get better. Your experiences sound incredibly challenging, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile. The presence of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>thought broadcasting</sym> (feeling like others can hear your thoughts), and <sym>significant depressive symptoms</sym> (feeling down, loss of interest) point towards a <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med>. Co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> is considered due to <sym>persistent feelings of sadness</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> is also a concern given <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm diagnosis and assess treatment needs.\n2. Medication management: antipsychotics for <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med>, antidepressants for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and anxiolytics for <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> if necessary.\n3. Psychotherapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: sleep hygiene practices, regular exercise, and social support groups to improve overall well-being.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
