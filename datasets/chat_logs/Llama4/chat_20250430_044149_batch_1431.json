This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being and inform our work together. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Their responses suggest potential depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as possible bipolar spectrum disorder. The patient's reports of suicidal ideation and avoidance behaviors are concerning and warrant further exploration. Additionally, their cognitive disturbances, including unpleasant thoughts and memory difficulties, may indicate underlying psychological processes. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address these clinical concerns.",

It's like you're trying to navigate through a tough time, but it's hard to find your footing. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and not really living, which suggests a sense of <sym>detachment</sym> from yourself and your surroundings. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n**Mood Disorder, Provisional Diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> Features**\n\n**Reasoning:** \nYour responses suggest a complex clinical profile, with symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>. Your reports of <sym>mood instability</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with a <med>mood disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although not with intent, is a significant concern. While your symptoms could be indicative of a <med>bipolar spectrum disorder</med>, more information is needed to confirm this diagnosis. Therefore, a provisional diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxiety</med> features seems warranted.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further explore your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med> with a psychiatrist or a medical doctor to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to ensure your safety, given your reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5. Encourage you to keep a <med>mood journal</med> to track your symptoms and identify patterns.",
