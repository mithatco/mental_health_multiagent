          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and related distress. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Reduced interest in activities, feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and frustration.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent worry, irritability, panic attacks, and fear of losing control.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Difficulty sleeping and unrested upon waking.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches, muscle tension, stomach issues, and shortness of breath.\n- **Cognitive Symptoms:** Difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and intrusive thoughts.\n- **Behavioral Changes:** Avoidance of social and public situations due to anxiety.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Pervasive Anxiety:** The patient's responses indicate a high level of anxiety that permeates many aspects of their life, including social interactions, daily activities, and sleep.\n- **Depressive Affect:** Feelings of hopelessness, lack of pleasure in activities, and irritability suggest a depressive mood.\n- **Somatic Complaints:** Multiple physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, which are often linked to anxiety and stress.\n- **Self-Isolation:** The patient has started to isolate themselves from social interactions due to anxiety.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent and excessive worry about everyday things, even when there's no apparent reason to worry.\n- **Panic Disorder:** Recurring panic attacks and fear of experiencing another episode.\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** Avoidance of social situations due to fear of judgment or embarrassment.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts about not wanting to be here but denies intent to harm themselves. This is a significant risk factor that warrants immediate attention and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies excessive alcohol or tobacco use, the mention of herbal remedies for anxiety could indicate a desire for self-management of symptoms, which might not be safe or effective.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic, along with physical and cognitive complaints. The pervasive nature of their anxiety and depressive symptoms has led to substantial impairment in social and occupational functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent, along with panic attacks and significant distress, highlights the need for a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses these areas. \n\n**DSM-5** diagnoses to consider include Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder. A thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed clinical interview and potentially additional assessments, is necessary to confirm these diagnoses and guide treatment. \n\nImmediate priorities include addressing the patient's safety, particularly regarding suicidal ideation, and developing a treatment plan to manage their depressive and anxiety symptoms. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Initiate safety planning and closely monitor for suicidal ideation.\n- Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.\n- Consider therapeutic interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or medication to manage symptoms.\n- Explore coping strategies and stress management techniques.\n\nThis summary focuses on the patient's reported symptoms and experiences, aiming to guide further clinical assessment and intervention.",

Additionally, your <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> suggest <med>MDD</med>.
