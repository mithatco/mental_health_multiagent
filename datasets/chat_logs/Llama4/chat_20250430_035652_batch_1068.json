You mentioned that you've been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and that these feelings have been impacting your daily life. You also shared that you get annoyed easily and have been snapping at your partner. Additionally, you've been experiencing sleep disturbances, and you've used marijuana in the past. It's clear that you're facing some tough challenges, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Impulse Control Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> (Q1), <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> (Q14) are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's endorsements of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q8) and fear of failing (Q7) also suggest a potential diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Furthermore, the patient's <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> (Q5) and <sym>substance use</sym> (Q23) may indicate difficulties with impulse control, consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Impulse Control Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>MDD</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and/or <med>Impulse Control Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific symptoms, including <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>.\n3. Consideration of <med>psychotherapy</med> and/or <med>pharmacotherapy</med> to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n4. Encouragement of healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
