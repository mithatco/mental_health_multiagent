Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've expressed feelings of being on edge, having trouble sleeping, and experiencing headaches and stomachaches. You're also worried about your future and feel disconnected from others. <quote>\"It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting anymore. I've been feeling down a lot lately. It's like this cloud of sadness following me around.\"</quote> These feelings are impacting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med>, including <sym>decreased interest or pleasure in activities</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggests a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>, possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> or <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>\"cloud of sadness\"</quote> and feelings of being overwhelmed also support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. **Medication:** Consideration of antidepressant medication to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. **Safety Planning:** Development of a safety plan to address suicidal ideation, including crisis intervention and support systems.\n5. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encouragement of healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise, balanced diet, and stress management techniques.",
