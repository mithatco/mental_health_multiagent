This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their experiences suggest a pervasive pattern of worry and anxiety that interferes with daily functioning and relationships. The patient's reports of avoidance, irritability, and somatic symptoms further highlight the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment. A thorough diagnostic evaluation and consideration of evidence-based interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatments, may be warranted to address the patient's symptoms and improve their overall well-being.",

However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as irritability, sleep disturbances, and somatic symptoms. The justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments of unnatural or robotic phrasing. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling guilty about not being more engaged, the therapist could have provided more emotional validation. However, the therapist generally acknowledged the patient's distress and provided a supportive tone."
