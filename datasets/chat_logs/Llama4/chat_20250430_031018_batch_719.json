This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your well-being over the past two weeks. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
