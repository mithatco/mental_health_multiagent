You've expressed <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are affecting your daily life. You've also shared <quote>\"sometimes it feels like it would be easier to just not be here anymore\"</quote>, which suggests that you're experiencing significant emotional pain. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm taking your concerns seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest anxious distress. While your symptoms could also suggest <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, the pervasive nature of your <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> lead me to prioritize <med>MDD</med> as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. <med>Psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>relationship issues</sym>.\n4. Develop a <med>sleep hygiene</med> plan to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
