It's like you're constantly worried about something bad happening, and these thoughts are really affecting your daily life. You mentioned having trouble focusing on things because your mind keeps racing, and it's hard to shake off feelings of sadness. <quote>\u201cI don't really feel like I have the energy or motivation to do things like I used to.\u201d</quote> These are really tough things to deal with, and it takes a lot of courage to share them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, with anxious distress, and possible Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation. The <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling down and hopeless, lack of motivation, and changes in sleep patterns, are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors, are significant. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (e.g., needing to do things a certain way) may indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>. A comprehensive evaluation is needed to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and mental status examination to gather more information.\n2. Consider referring the patient to a therapist, such as a cognitive-behavioral therapist, to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n4. Develop a treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific needs and goals, including coping strategies for managing <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
