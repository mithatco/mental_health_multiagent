Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- The patient reports experiencing significant anxiety in social situations, which leads to avoidance behaviors (Q6, Q8).\n- They express feelings of nervousness, being on edge, and worry about being judged or saying something inappropriate (Q6, Q7).\n- Physical symptoms such as stomachaches, headaches, and an increased heart rate are noted before and during social events (Q9).\n- The patient experiences sleep disturbances due to racing thoughts about social interactions (Q14).\n- They report intrusive thoughts related to fear of social embarrassment or failure (Q16).\n- Feelings of detachment from themselves in social situations are also mentioned (Q18).\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- A clear pattern of social anxiety disorder symptoms emerges, including fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others (Q6, Q8).\n- The patient's responses suggest a tendency towards avoidance behaviors specifically related to social interactions.\n- Physical manifestations of anxiety are common, particularly in anticipation of or during social events.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's significant distress in social situations, fear of negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interactions suggest this diagnosis could be applicable.\n- **Possible Major Depressive Disorder:** While not strongly indicated, feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness are not reported; however, the impact of social anxiety on relationships and daily functioning could potentially contribute to or exacerbate depressive symptoms.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Anxiety about social events interferes with sleep quality.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- The patient reports no current suicidal ideation (Q11) but expresses a desire for more social connections and less anxiety in social situations.\n- Substance use is minimal and does not appear to be a coping mechanism or risk factor at this time.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a clinical picture suggestive of Social Anxiety Disorder, characterized by marked fear or anxiety in one or more social situations (e.g., public speaking, social gatherings) where the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. This leads to significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning. The patient exhibits avoidance behaviors, physical symptoms of anxiety, and intrusive thoughts related to social interactions. Sleep disturbances are also reported, likely secondary to anxiety about upcoming social events. While there are no immediate indications of severe mental health issues such as suicidal ideation or psychotic symptoms, the patient's social anxiety significantly impacts their quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Further evaluation and possible intervention, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacotherapy, may be warranted to address these symptoms and improve functioning.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with significant <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, which makes you feel <sym>nervous</sym>, <sym>on edge</sym>, and worried about being judged or saying something inappropriate. You mentioned that you enjoy your hobbies but find social situations tough, and you've been avoiding parties and big meetings. You also experience physical symptoms like <sym>stomachaches</sym> and <sym>headaches</sym> before social events. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you find ways to manage these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, characterized by a marked fear or anxiety in one or more social situations where the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. This fear is persistent and leads to significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about social interactions, and physical manifestations of anxiety (e.g., <sym>stomachaches</sym>, <sym>headaches</sym>) support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> likely secondary to anxiety about social events further support the impact of this condition on their daily life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <quote>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</quote> could be beneficial in addressing the patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with social anxiety.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to gradually expose themselves to feared social situations in a controlled and supportive manner to build confidence and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n4. Provide guidance on <quote>stress management techniques</quote>, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or meditation, to help alleviate <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
