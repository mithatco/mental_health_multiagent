      "expected": "bipolar",
      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions, with periods of feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, alongside times of irritability and anxiety. You've mentioned struggling with sleep, sometimes sleeping less but having a lot of energy, and other times sleeping too much. These fluctuations in mood and energy have affected your daily life, making it hard for you to connect with others and find enjoyment in activities. You've also shared concerns about your substance use and thoughts about death, which can be really scary and overwhelming. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder, Unspecified</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of fluctuating mood, including periods of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, suggest a mood disorder. However, with the information provided, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific diagnosis like <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. Your <quote>\"rollercoaster\"</quote> of emotions and experiences align with a <med>Mood Disorder, Unspecified</med>, which captures the complexity and variability of your symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation by a mental health professional to determine a more specific diagnosis and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This type of therapy can help you address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and behaviors contributing to your symptoms.\n3. **Medication Assessment:** A medical professional may consider prescribing medication to help regulate your mood, manage <sym>anxiety</sym>, or address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Substance Use Counseling:** Given your substance use, counseling can help you understand the impact of substances on your mental health and develop strategies for reduction or cessation.\n5. **Support Groups:** Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and connection with others who understand what you're going through.",
