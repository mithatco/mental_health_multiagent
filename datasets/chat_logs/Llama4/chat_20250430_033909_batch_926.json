The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like panic attacks, avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, and feelings of irritability to the diagnosis of anxiety disorder. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing the differential diagnosis and ruling out other conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed empathy and a professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling like people don't understand what they're going through, the therapist responded with understanding.
