You mentioned feeling \"down a lot\" and experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> that are impacting your relationships and overall well-being. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings, and it's taking a toll on your mental health.

The patient's report of <quote>\"feeling down a lot\"</quote> and <quote>\"being anxious all the time\"</quote> suggests a pervasive experience of negative emotions. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan or intent requires careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam and lab tests, to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. **Medication:** Consideration of antidepressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Education on sleep hygiene practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. **Crisis Intervention:** Establishment of a crisis plan, including emergency contact numbers, to ensure the patient's safety given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.",
