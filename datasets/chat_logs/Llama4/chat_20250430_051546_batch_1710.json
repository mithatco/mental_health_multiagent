No dimension was omitted or superficially addressed.",

The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology.

The therapist demonstrated a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria and effectively applied it during the assessment.",

The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, and there were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.

The conversation had a smooth transition and was well-structured.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as excessive worry, anxiety, feelings of depression, and avoidance behaviors. The justification was comprehensive, and the therapist considered alternative diagnoses. The diagnostic conclusions directly linked to the patient's reported symptoms and DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their feelings, and provided a supportive environment. The interactions were warm and personalized, with the therapist tailoring responses to the patient's emotional state.
