The patient's reports of <sym>auditory hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices) and <sym>thought interference</sym> (feeling like people can hear thoughts) suggest <med>psychotic features</med>.

Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, lab tests, and a detailed psychiatric interview, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Medication: <med>Antidepressant medication</med>, such as an SSRI or SNRI, may be considered to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Therapy: <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> may be beneficial in addressing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n4. Substance use counseling: Given the patient's report of substance use, counseling on <med>substance use disorder</med> treatment and relapse prevention may be necessary.\n5. Crisis intervention: The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> requires immediate attention; a crisis plan, including emergency contact numbers and a safe crisis plan, should be established.",
