        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology, and the therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning. The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and demonstrated a coherent conversational arc. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs, and the therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria. The differential diagnosis was comprehensively considered, and alternative diagnoses were adequately ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the tone seemed slightly impersonal or robotic. The therapist generally acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state, but could have demonstrated more warmth and personalized interaction."
