You mentioned having <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> quite often. You also shared that you're <sym>nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge</sym> almost all the time and have <sym>panic attacks</sym> occasionally. Additionally, you've been having trouble sleeping and sometimes feel like you're <sym>detached or distant from yourself, your body, your physical surroundings, or your memories</sym>. These experiences sound incredibly challenging and isolating. It's clear that you're struggling with a range of symptoms that are impacting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses indicate significant symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, including <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>diminished interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. The presence of <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further supports the consideration of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms, along with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym>, suggests a complex clinical picture that warrants a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. The patient's <quote>constant background noise that I just can't shake off</quote> and <quote>feeling like I'm on edge a lot</quote> highlight the pervasive nature of their anxiety. \n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the presence of specific disorders and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Consideration of <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med>, to address symptoms of <med>depression</med>, <med>anxiety</med>, and <med>obsessive-compulsive behaviors</med>.\n3. Evaluation for potential <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n4. Development of a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
