Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a self-rated tool that helps us identify areas that might be impacting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The co-occurrence of these symptoms indicates a need for a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.
