      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a deep sense of emptiness and unmotivation, making it hard for you to find joy in things you used to enjoy. <quote>It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> You also shared feelings of being down, depressed, and hopeless, with a weight on your shoulders all the time. These emotions seem to be affecting your daily life, causing you to withdraw from social situations and feel disconnected from others. Your sleep has been disrupted, with early morning wake-ups and an inability to fall back asleep. You're experiencing physical symptoms like back pain and headaches, and you've had thoughts of harming yourself, although you don't have a plan. It's clear that you're facing a tough time, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with anxious distress \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern of symptoms consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), including <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15). The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2) further supports this diagnosis. The patient's <quote>feelings of emptiness and unmotivation</quote> and <quote>weight on my shoulders</quote> suggest a significant depressive episode. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without a plan requires careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to improve mood and reduce stress.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
