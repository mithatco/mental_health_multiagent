You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a heavy weight on your shoulders. <quote>It's like nothing seems as interesting or fun anymore. I've been going through the motions, but it's hard to find the energy or excitement in activities.</quote> Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're experiencing anxiety, feeling like you're on edge a lot of the time. You're also having trouble with memory and feeling detached from yourself and others. These are all really tough things to deal with, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15). The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7) suggests anxious distress, which is a specifier for MDD. The patient's <quote>feelings of hopelessness</quote> and <quote>thoughts of hurting oneself</quote> (Q11) indicate a need for careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to help improve sleep quality.\n4. Consider <med>mindfulness-based interventions</med> to reduce stress and increase self-compassion.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
