Their reports of suicidal ideation, social isolation, and cognitive impairment highlight the need for comprehensive assessment and treatment planning. The patient's symptoms are likely to meet diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and potentially an anxiety disorder.

It's like I'm just going through the motions.</quote> Your sleep has been poor, waking up early and feeling tired. You're also experiencing anxiety, worry, and <sym>panic-like feelings</sym>, which have led you to avoid social situations. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope and feeling overwhelmed.
