The patient's symptoms suggest potential diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders. The clinician should consider further evaluation and assessment to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan. Ongoing monitoring of the patient's symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation and substance use, is essential to ensure their safety and well-being.",
