I'm going to use the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire to understand your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a self-rated tool that helps us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressed mood (Q2: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless)\n* Anhedonia (Q1: little interest or pleasure in doing things)\n* Irritability (Q3: feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual)\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4: trouble sleeping, nightmares)\n* Anxiety (Q6: feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge)\n* Panic attacks (Q7)\n* Avoidance behaviors (Q8: avoiding driving, discussing the accident)\n* Somatic symptoms (Q9: back pain, headaches)\n* Cognitive difficulties (Q15: trouble concentrating, memory issues)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports a significant decrease in interest and pleasure in activities (Q1) and feelings of hopelessness (Q2), suggesting a depressive episode.\n* Anxiety and fear are prominent, with reports of being \"on edge\" (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8).\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14) and cognitive difficulties (Q15) are also common themes.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive disorders (Major Depressive Disorder)\n* Anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder)\n* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) given the patient's reported accident and avoidance behaviors\n* Sleep-Wake Disorders (Insomnia Disorder)\n* Somatic Symptom Disorder (persistent concerns about physical symptoms)\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation (Q11: \"sometimes it feels like everything would be easier if I wasn't here\")\n* Increased substance use (Q21: drinking more than usual)\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex symptom profile, suggesting comorbid mental health conditions. Depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and hopelessness, are prominent. Anxiety and fear are also significant, with panic attacks and avoidance behaviors. Sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's reported accident and avoidance behaviors raise concerns for PTSD. Suicidal ideation and increased substance use are notable risk factors. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are warranted to address these clinical concerns.",
