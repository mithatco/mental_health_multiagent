Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This is a tool that helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one by one. Please feel free to express yourself in as much detail as you like. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
