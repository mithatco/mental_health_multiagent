The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to take your time to answer, and we can discuss anything that feels unclear or difficult. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
