Depressive symptoms, such as feeling down and hopeless, are also reported. The patient's difficulty sleeping and recurring thoughts of self-doubt and fear of negative evaluation may be related to their anxiety. Overall, the patient's symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, with possible co-occurring depressive symptoms. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these observations and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* 300.23 Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)\n* 296.32 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) - less likely, but not ruled out\n* 300.02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - less likely, but not ruled out\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Further evaluation and assessment to confirm diagnosis and identify co-occurring conditions\n* Development of a treatment plan to address social anxiety and depressive symptoms\n* Consideration of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or medication to manage symptoms.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and worrying about what others think of you. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. It takes a lot of courage to share these feelings, and I appreciate your trust in me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>fear of judgment</sym>, <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, and <sym>anxiety in social situations</sym> are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling down and hopeless, particularly in social situations, suggest possible co-occurring <med>depressive symptoms</med>. However, the primary symptoms presented align more closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and fear in social situations</quote> and <quote>avoiding situations that make you anxious</quote> further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations.\n2. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n3. A comprehensive assessment of <med>depressive symptoms</med> to determine if a co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med> is present.\n4. Development of a coping plan to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>self-esteem</sym>.\n5. Consideration of <med>medication</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, if deemed necessary.",
