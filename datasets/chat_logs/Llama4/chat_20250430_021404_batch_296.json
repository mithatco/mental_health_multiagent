Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment consists of 23 questions and will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
