The therapist ensured that all relevant areas, including depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use, were covered. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a clear understanding of the patient's mental health status.",

The language used was clear and aligned with clinical terminology, ensuring that the patient's symptoms were correctly identified and assessed.
