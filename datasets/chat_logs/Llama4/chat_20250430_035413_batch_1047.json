You mentioned feeling disconnected from activities that once brought you joy, and experiencing persistent sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety. <quote>It's like I'm just going through the motions. Sometimes I feel like I'm just existing, not really living.</quote> Your sleep patterns are disrupted, and you're experiencing aches and pains. You're also hearing voices and feeling like someone could hear your thoughts. These symptoms are clearly overwhelming and suggest that you're in significant distress.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. The presence of hallucinations (Q12), perceived control over thoughts (Q13), and possible command hallucinations raise concerns for a <med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), and changes in sleep patterns (Q4, Q14) are consistent with a <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic episodes</sym> (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms.\n2. Crisis intervention to address the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure their safety.\n3. Collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker, to develop a treatment plan.\n4. Pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotic medication, to address <med>psychotic symptoms</med>.\n5. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address <med>depressive</med> and <med>anxiety symptoms</med>.\n6. Consideration of hospitalization if the patient's symptoms worsen or if they are at imminent risk to themselves or others.",
