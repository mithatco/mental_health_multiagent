The therapist maintained a coherent and well-structured dialogue, ensuring that the patient's disclosures were adequately explored and addressed. The conversation had a smooth progression, with no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",

The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive rationale for each diagnosis. The reasoning was transparent, and the diagnostic process was well-supported by the patient's reported symptoms.",
