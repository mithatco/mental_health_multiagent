Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
