Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Reports feeling disconnected from previously enjoyed activities due to overwhelming anxiety.\n- Experiences recurrent panic attacks, significant anxiety, and fear of having future attacks.\n- Avoids situations that may trigger anxiety or panic.\n- Exhibits irritability, particularly with family members.\n- Endorses feelings of being down, especially post-panic attacks, but not hopelessness.\n- Reports sleep disturbances, with increased sleep due to anxiety about panic attacks.\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and fear related to panic attacks and their consequences.\n- Avoidance behaviors aimed at preventing panic attacks.\n- Impact on daily functioning and interpersonal relationships.\n- Physical symptoms, such as aches and pains, possibly related to anxiety.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms align closely with panic disorder, given the recurrent panic attacks, fear of having future attacks, and significant avoidance behaviors.\n- **Depressive Disorders:** While not meeting full criteria, the patient reports days of feeling down and hopelessness, suggesting possible co-morbid depressive symptoms.\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Reports significant sleep disturbances.\n- **Other Potential Concerns:** Physical symptoms without clear medical explanation, feelings of being a burden, and questioning one's identity and life goals.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient mentions feeling like a burden and wonders if others would be better off without them, indicating passive suicidal ideation without active intent or plan.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies using substances or medications without a prescription.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms suggestive of panic disorder, with recurrent panic attacks, significant distress, and avoidance behaviors. Co-morbid depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances are also noted. The patient experiences feelings of disconnection and questioning of self-identity. While there are no active suicidal plans, passive ideation is present. The clinical picture suggests a need for further evaluation to confirm diagnoses and to develop an appropriate treatment plan focusing on anxiety management, mood symptoms, and improving daily functioning.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Panic Disorder (300.21)\n- Major Depressive Disorder (296.32) - for co-morbid depressive symptoms\n- Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified (300.00)\n- Sleep-Wake Disorder, Unspecified (780.52)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of specific disorders.\n- Development of a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT), medication (e.g., SSRIs, benzodiazepines for short-term relief), and sleep hygiene practices.\n- Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and overall mental health status.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"walking on eggshells\" and constantly worried about having another attack, which has led to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and a sense of isolation. Your feelings of being down, especially after panic attacks, and concerns about being a burden to others are also valid and concerning. <quote>\"I feel like I'm going to die or lose control\"</quote> during panic attacks highlights the intensity of your fear. It's clear that these experiences have affected your relationships and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder (300.21)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the presence of recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>fear of having future attacks</sym>, and significant <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> aimed at preventing panic. The impact on daily functioning and the presence of co-morbid <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> further support this diagnosis. The <sym>physical symptoms</sym> without clear medical explanation and feelings of being a burden also align with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and to assess for co-morbid conditions such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that may include <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>, and <med>medication</med> (e.g., <med>SSRIs</med>, <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term relief).\n3. <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Close monitoring of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and overall mental health status.\n5. Consideration of <med>family therapy</med> to address relationship issues and provide support.\n6. Regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment efficacy and make necessary adjustments.",
