      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and discomfort in social situations, which can be really tough to deal with. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying social gatherings or parties, but you do appreciate spending time with close friends. You also shared that you get nervous and anxious in situations that make you feel uncomfortable or judged, and that you've been experiencing some physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches when you're anxious. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> and <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your responses, it appears that you're experiencing significant distress and disruption in your daily life due to your symptoms. Your reports of <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>fear of being judged</sym> in social situations, as well as your avoidance of these situations, suggest potential diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, your experiences of <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym> when anxious, as well as your concerns about your illnesses not being taken seriously, may indicate <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. I considered multiple possible diagnoses, including <med>Depressive Disorders</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorders</med>, but <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> seem to be the most relevant.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address your <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>negative thought patterns</sym>.\n2. Exposure therapy to help you gradually become comfortable in social situations that trigger your anxiety.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. A comprehensive physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your <sym>somatic symptoms</sym>.\n5. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to help manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, if deemed necessary by a medical professional.",
