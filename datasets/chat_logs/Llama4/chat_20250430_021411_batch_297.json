You mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and that there are days when a cloud feels like it's over you. You're also experiencing anxiety, worry, and panic attacks, which are making it hard for you to sleep and enjoy relationships with others. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, as evidenced by intrusive thoughts (Q16), repetitive behaviors (Q17), and significant distress and impairment in daily life. The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2) and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7) suggests co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. Your reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with an emphasis on exposure and response prevention (ERP) to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to manage <med>OCD</med>, <med>depressive</med>, and <med>anxiety</med> symptoms.\n3. Development of a <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> plan to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Regular check-ins to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Consideration of additional assessments, such as <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depression rating scales</med>, to inform treatment planning.",
