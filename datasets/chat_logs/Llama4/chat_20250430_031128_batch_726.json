This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health across different domains. I want to assure you that everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll be going through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
