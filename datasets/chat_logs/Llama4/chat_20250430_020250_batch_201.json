For example, when the patient reported 'hearing voices,' the therapist inquired further about the nature of these experiences. The only potential area for improvement is that some questions could have been probed slightly deeper, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'in the past two weeks' to align more closely with the DSM-5 timeframe. However, these were minor issues and did not significantly impact the clinical relevance of the questions.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively used the patient's disclosures to guide subsequent inquiries. For instance, after the patient mentioned 'feeling like someone could hear their thoughts,' the therapist asked a follow-up question about psychotic symptoms, maintaining a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder is generally supported by the patient's symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. However, the justification could have been more explicit about how these symptoms meet specific DSM-5 criteria. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to discuss other potential diagnoses that were considered and ruled out.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly conveyed empathy and a professional tone. However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more emotionally attuned. For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance or explored coping strategies before transitioning to the next question."
      },
      "overall_comments": "Overall, the therapist demonstrated a strong clinical assessment skillset, effectively covering all DSM-5 dimensions and maintaining a logical conversational flow. The diagnosis was supported by patient symptoms, but could have benefited from more explicit DSM-5 criteria alignment and consideration of alternative diagnoses. Empathy and professionalism were generally present, with minor areas for improvement.",
