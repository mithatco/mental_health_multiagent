The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and adequately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and impulsive behaviors. The conversational arc was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a clear justification for the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms and substance use concerns, directly citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when the patient discussed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation and support. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, showed empathy, and provided a clear diagnosis with justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language and deeper emotional validation, the overall performance was strong.",
