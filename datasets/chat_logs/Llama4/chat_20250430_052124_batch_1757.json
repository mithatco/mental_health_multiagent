This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and then we'll discuss the results. Let's start with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

These symptoms are affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, including intrusive thoughts (Q16), compulsive behaviors (Q17), and significant distress and impairment, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>OCD</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> suggest a pattern consistent with <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, the patient's depressive symptoms (Q2) and loss of interest in activities (Q1) may indicate a co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Development of coping strategies and stress management techniques to improve sleep quality and overall well-being.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Consideration of additional assessments, such as a <med>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med> evaluation, if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen.",
