Their voice carries a tone of sadness and hopelessness, revealing a deep-seated struggle with <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>. The patient's words paint a picture of a life overshadowed by <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym>, making everyday interactions feel like insurmountable challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's responses to the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult reveal a complex clinical picture that aligns closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The endorsement of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are all consistent with diagnostic criteria for MDD. Additionally, the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan necessitates careful consideration and monitoring. While <med>Anxiety Disorders</med> are also a possibility given the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, the pervasive nature of their <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> suggests that <med>MDD</med> may be the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough clinical interview and review of the patient's medical and psychiatric history to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Pharmacological Intervention:** Consider prescribing <med>antidepressants</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n3. **Psychotherapy:** Recommend <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address the patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene Practices:** Educate the patient on healthy sleep habits, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine.\n5. **Suicidal Risk Assessment:** Conduct regular assessments of suicidal ideation and risk, and develop a safety plan with the patient to ensure their immediate safety.",
