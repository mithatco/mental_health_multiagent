The therapist could have probed deeper in certain areas, but overall coverage was good.",

For example, questions 4 and 5 about sleep and increased activity were somewhat superficial. Additionally, some questions could have been more precisely worded to match DSM-5 terminology. However, the therapist made an effort to adapt questions to the patient's responses.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly moved to a new topic without fully exploring the patient's previous disclosures.

Overall, the conversation was coherent but could have benefited from smoother transitions.",

The therapist explicitly linked the diagnosis to specific symptoms like feeling down, irritated, anxious, and having panic attacks.

The therapist provided a clear rationale but could have explored other potential diagnoses.",
