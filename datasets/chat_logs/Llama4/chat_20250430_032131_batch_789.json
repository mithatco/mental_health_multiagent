The traumatic event appears to have had a significant impact on their mental health, contributing to symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The patient's sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and emotional regulation challenges further complicate their clinical presentation. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as a coping mechanism raises concerns about the patient's safety and treatment needs.
