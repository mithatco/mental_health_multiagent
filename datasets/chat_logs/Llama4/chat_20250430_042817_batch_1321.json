Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health and identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Your responses will help us better understand your current situation. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
