Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment consists of 23 questions that will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can share your experiences with me. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
