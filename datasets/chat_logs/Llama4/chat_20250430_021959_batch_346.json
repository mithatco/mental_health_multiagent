You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that <quote>it's hard to explain, but sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions</quote>. I can sense the frustration and helplessness that comes with dealing with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym>, and it's clear that these symptoms are affecting your relationships and daily life. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>OCD</med>, as evidenced by the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>compulsions</sym> (Q17). The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7), and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) also suggest a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>constant background anxiety</quote> and <quote>feelings of detachment</quote> further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsions</sym> associated with <med>OCD</med>.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage symptoms of <med>MDD</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n3. Development of a sleep hygiene plan to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14).\n4. Regular check-ins to monitor <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Consideration of exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.",
