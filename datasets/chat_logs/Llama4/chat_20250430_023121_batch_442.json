The patient's recent experience of a significant life event (divorce) appears to have triggered or exacerbated these symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by plans, warrants careful assessment and monitoring. The patient's reports of emotional distress, cognitive disturbances, and interpersonal difficulties highlight the need for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning. Further assessment and exploration of these symptoms are necessary to determine the most effective treatment approach.",
