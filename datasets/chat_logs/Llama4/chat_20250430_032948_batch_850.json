The patient's experiences of <sym>interpersonal disconnection</sym> and <sym>cognitive fogginess</sym> also align with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough assessment, including a physical exam, lab tests, and psychological evaluations, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Medication management: Consultation with a psychiatrist to explore medication options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> and <med>antipsychotics</med>, to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>.\n3.
