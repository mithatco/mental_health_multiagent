      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and discomfort in social situations, which can make everyday interactions feel daunting and overwhelming. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and having trouble connecting with others, which can be really isolating. It's clear that these experiences are affecting your daily life and causing significant distress. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of feeling anxious and fearful in social situations, avoiding social interactions, and experiencing physical symptoms like blushing, sweating, and a shaky voice, suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. However, your responses also indicate a pervasive pattern of social communication difficulties, which aligns with <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>. Additionally, your reports of feeling nervous, anxious, and fearful, along with sleep disturbances and rumination, meet criteria for <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>generalized anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n2. Social skills training to improve communication and pragmatic skills.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>rumination</sym>.\n4. Referral to a psychiatrist for potential medication evaluation to address <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depressive</med> symptoms.\n5. Encouragement to keep a journal or log to track <sym>symptoms</sym> and identify patterns and triggers.",
