The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. Over the next session, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to express yourself in as much detail as you like. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I mean, I love my hobbies, but when I'm in the middle of a panic attack, nothing seems to bring me joy. It's like my mind is preoccupied with fear, and I just want to feel safe again."
