I've been trying to get back into my routine, but it's hard to find the motivation.\"</quote> It sounds incredibly tough to navigate these feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety. Your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive impairments</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches further highlight the distress you're enduring. I'm here to support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD) with anxious distress, <med>Sleep-Wake Disorder</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align with criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, including <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of sadness and hopelessness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> (Q4). The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) suggest co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms. The patient's <sym>cognitive impairments</sym> (Q15) and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> (Q9) further support this diagnostic impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Initiate <med>psychotherapy</med>, specifically <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n2. Develop a <med>sleep hygiene</med> plan to regulate sleep patterns and improve overall sleep quality.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.\n4. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and anxiety.",
