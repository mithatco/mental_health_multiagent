This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, Q2).\n- Increased irritability (Q3).\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14).\n- Anxiety symptoms, including feeling on edge, panic attacks, and fear of having panic attacks (Q6, Q7, Q8).\n- Somatic complaints (Q9).\n- Feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm (Q11).\n- Cognitive difficulties, including memory issues and feeling foggy (Q15).\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n- Avoidance behaviors, particularly related to anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- Physical symptoms that may be related to anxiety or depression (e.g., stomach issues, headaches) (Q9).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep, feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, or Social Anxiety Disorder, given the patient's reports of anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Presence of unexplained physical symptoms (Q9).\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of self-harm or wishing they could disappear during panic attacks (Q11), indicating a need for careful assessment of suicide risk.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies using substances to cope, but expresses a desire for relief from symptoms.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, significant impairment in social and occupational functioning, and several somatic complaints. The patient's reports of recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors suggest a potential diagnosis of panic disorder and possibly a depressive disorder. The presence of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors further supports the consideration of anxiety disorders. The patient's expression of hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm indicate a need for immediate assessment of suicidal risk. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed clinical interview and potentially additional measures (e.g., suicide risk assessment tools), is warranted to guide treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a lot of distress lately, feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and carrying a cloud of sadness with you. You've described <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are really taking over your life, making it hard to sleep, and causing physical symptoms like stomach issues and headaches. It's clear that these symptoms are affecting your relationships and daily functioning, and at times, you're feeling hopeless and wishing things could just stop. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, given the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, persistent worry about having more attacks, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> to prevent triggering attacks. Additionally, your reported <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. These conditions often co-occur, and addressing both is crucial for effective treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation, including a detailed clinical interview and potentially additional measures like <med>suicide risk assessment tools</med>, is necessary to confirm these diagnoses and rule out others.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This form of therapy has been effective for both <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, helping you change negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication:** Depending on the outcome of the diagnostic evaluation, medication such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> might be considered to help manage symptoms.\n4. **Lifestyle Changes:** Recommendations for regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation), and improving sleep hygiene can support overall mental health.\n5. **Support System:** Encouraging you to reconnect with friends and family or joining a support group can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.",
