The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment will help us understand your mental health across various domains. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I used to enjoy going out with friends or trying new hobbies, but lately, I've been avoiding those things because I'm scared of having a panic attack in public.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety, particularly panic attacks, which appear to be the central issue. These attacks are accompanied by intense fear, physical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath), and a pervasive fear of having future attacks. This has led to avoidance behaviors, significantly impacting daily functioning and relationships. Depressive symptoms are also present, including feeling down, hopeless, and a general disinterest in activities due to anxiety. The patient expresses irritability and short-temperedness, likely secondary to the chronic anxiety and fear of panic attacks.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient's responses consistently highlight anxiety and panic as predominant themes. The fear of panic attacks appears to drive many of the patient's behaviors and emotional states.\n- **Avoidance:** Avoidance behaviors are prominent, with the patient steering clear of situations that might trigger panic attacks, leading to social withdrawal and impacting relationships.\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** While not as dominant as anxiety, depressive symptoms are present, including feelings of hopelessness, guilt, and a decrease in interest in activities.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, likely exacerbated by worry about panic attacks and general anxiety.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's symptoms strongly suggest an anxiety disorder, potentially panic disorder with agoraphobia given the avoidance behaviors.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** The presence of sustained feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and decreased interest in activities may indicate a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the fear of panic attacks and avoidance behaviors could suggest some elements of PTSD if the panic attacks are triggered by specific traumatic events.\n- **Risk of Suicide:** The patient reports thoughts of self-harm during panic attacks, indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and management.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of self-harm during panic attacks, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances inappropriately, the absence of alcohol or drug use might be protective but also indicates a need to monitor for potential self-medication behaviors.\n- **Social Isolation:** The patient's avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal are concerning for increased risk of depression and anxiety progression.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with a clinical picture dominated by symptoms of anxiety, particularly panic disorder, which appears to have led to significant avoidance behaviors, social isolation, and depressive symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation during panic attacks elevates the risk profile. Key areas for further evaluation and intervention include panic disorder, potential co-occurring depressive disorder, risk management for suicidal ideation, and strategies to improve coping and reduce avoidance behaviors. A comprehensive treatment plan addressing these areas is warranted.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (if trauma-related triggers are identified)\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic interview\n- Assessment of suicide risk\n- Development of a tailored treatment plan, potentially including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication (e.g., SSRIs for panic and depressive symptoms), and coping strategies for anxiety management.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"walking on eggshells\" all the time, worried about when the next attack will happen, and it's led to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social isolation</sym>. You've also expressed feelings of <sym>hopelessness</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and even had thoughts of self-harm during these attacks. It's clear that this has been a tremendously challenging experience for you, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>. The <sym>panic attacks</sym> are recurrent and unexpected, leading to <sym>persistent concern or worry</sym> about having future attacks or their consequences. The patient's <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are directly related to fear of having panic attacks in situations or places that might be difficult to escape or where help might not be available. Additionally, the presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as feeling down, hopeless, and a decrease in interest in activities, suggests a possible co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, which would require further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct an in-depth diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring mental health conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>panic disorder</sym> and <sym>agoraphobia</sym>, as well as strategies to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consider prescribing <med>SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for short-term relief of panic symptoms, alongside therapy.\n4. Implement coping strategies and relaxation techniques, such as <med>deep breathing exercises</med>, <med>progressive muscle relaxation</med>, and <med>mindfulness</med> to help manage anxiety.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress, adjust the treatment plan as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
