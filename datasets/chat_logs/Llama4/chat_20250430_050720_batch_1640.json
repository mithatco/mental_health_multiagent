      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a mix of emotions and experiences that are making life really tough for you. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and a persistent sense of sadness and hopelessness that's hard to shake off. <quote>\"I just go through the motions most days\"</quote> suggests a significant loss of interest and pleasure in daily activities. Additionally, you're experiencing a lot of anxiety and fear, feeling like you're constantly on edge and worried about things that might go wrong. Your sleep patterns are also disrupted, which can further exacerbate these feelings. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot right now, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> with <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a complex clinical presentation. The presence of <sym>hallucinations</sym> (Q12) and <sym>delusions</sym> (Q13) suggests a psychotic disorder, specifically <med>Schizophrenia</med>. The patient's report of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) supports co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Episode</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) expressed requires immediate attention and risk assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for suicidal ideation and develop a safety plan.\n2. Initiate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam and lab tests, to rule out underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to symptoms.\n3. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates medication and therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy, to address <med>Schizophrenia</med>, <med>Major Depressive Episode</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n4. Provide education on sleep hygiene and strategies to improve sleep quality.\n5. Consider referral to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, for ongoing management and support.",
