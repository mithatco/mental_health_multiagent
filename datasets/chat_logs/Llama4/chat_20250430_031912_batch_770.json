I'm going to be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This is a tool that helps us understand what symptoms you might be experiencing across different areas of mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one by one. Let's get started. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Anxiety symptoms, including worry and panic (Q6, Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors (Q8)\n- Somatic complaints (Q9)\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11)\n- Cognitive difficulties (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment and uncertainty about identity and relationships (Q18, Q19, Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- The patient reports a pervasive pattern of negative affect, including depression, anxiety, and irritability.\n- Significant sleep disturbances are noted, with excessive sleeping.\n- Avoidance behaviors and social withdrawal are evident.\n- The patient experiences both physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches) and cognitive difficulties (e.g., trouble concentrating, memory issues).\n- There is a clear indication of psychological distress affecting daily functioning.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of self-harm, indicating a significant risk.\n- **Cognitive Impairment:** Difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and confusion.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation without a plan (Q11).\n- Significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, including depressed mood, anhedonia, excessive worry, panic attacks, and sleep disturbances. The presence of suicidal ideation, although without a specific plan, necessitates immediate attention. Cognitive difficulties, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal further underscore the severity of the patient's condition. The clinical presentation suggests a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with anxious distress specifier, and possibly panic disorder. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed history, mental status examination, and consideration of differential diagnoses, is warranted. The patient's symptoms indicate a high level of distress and significant impairment, necessitating prompt intervention.",

Encourage the patient to engage in <sym>self-care activities</sym>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support groups.\n5.
