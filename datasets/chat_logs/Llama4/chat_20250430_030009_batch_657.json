You feel down, depressed, and hopeless, and it's like there's a weight on you all the time. You're also experiencing sleep disturbances, anxiety, and irritability, which are making it hard for you to cope with daily life. <quote>It's like I'm just going through the motions</quote>. I can sense the pain and frustration you're feeling, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) also supports this diagnosis. The patient's reports of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15, Q16) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) further support the diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: Schedule a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Psychotherapy: Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Medication: Evaluate the potential benefits and risks of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage the patient to engage in regular exercise, practice stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, relaxation), and maintain a consistent sleep schedule.\n5. Regular follow-up: Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms, treatment progress, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
