You mentioned feeling <sym>irritated and grouchy</sym> and having trouble sleeping. You're also experiencing <sym>anxiety and panic attacks</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you work through these challenges.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety and panic attacks</sym> suggest anxious distress, which is a common comorbidity with MDD. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for MDD include at least two weeks of <sym>depressed mood</sym> or <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, which you've described.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation**: I recommend a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) may be helpful in addressing your <sym>depressive and anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Medication**: Depending on the severity of your symptoms, medication such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> may be considered to help manage your symptoms.\n4. **Lifestyle changes**: I encourage you to engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-care, and establish a consistent sleep schedule to help regulate your mood.\n5. **Follow-up appointments**: Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor your progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
