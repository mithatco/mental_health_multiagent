        "explanation": "The diagnosis provided focuses on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress, mentioning symptoms such as fluctuating mood, feelings of hopelessness, and decreased interest in activities. While it notes 'some days I feel like I'm on top of the world, and others I just can't get out of bed,' which could suggest manic or hypomanic episodes, it does not explicitly diagnose or discuss bipolar disorder. The mention of 'up and down' mood could align with bipolar symptoms, but the diagnosis provided does not directly address or rule out bipolar disorder.",
