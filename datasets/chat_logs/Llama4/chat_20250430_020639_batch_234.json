I'm here to support you, and I'm using a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to help us understand your current mental health. This questionnaire will ask you 23 questions about your experiences over the past two weeks. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll ask each question one at a time, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I find myself just going through the motions without any excitement or joy. It's been like this for a while now, and it's really frustrating because I feel like I'm supposed to be able to handle this change better."
