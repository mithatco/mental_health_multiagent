You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying things like social gatherings or parties. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and <sym>nervous</sym> in these situations, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. Your feelings are valid, and it's great that you're taking steps to address them.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses suggest significant distress in social situations, including <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>fear</sym>, and <sym>avoidance</sym> (Q6, Q7, Q8). The patient's reports of feeling <quote>down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> (Q2) and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) in social situations also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's physical symptoms, such as <sym>headaches</sym> and <sym>stomach problems</sym> (Q9), are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's avoidance of social situations and reported difficulties with interpersonal relationships (Q20) further support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for symptom management, in conjunction with therapy.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
