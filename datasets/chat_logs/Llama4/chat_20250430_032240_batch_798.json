You've been experiencing <sym>depressed mood</sym>, feeling <quote>down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> a lot, and having a hard time sleeping with terrible nightmares. You've also been feeling <sym>irritated</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> easily, and you've been having <sym>panic attacks</sym> sometimes.

Additionally, your reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms and their impact on your daily life suggests that you may benefit from a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> to address symptoms of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>depression</med>.\n3. Encourage you to practice <med>self-care</med> techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4.
