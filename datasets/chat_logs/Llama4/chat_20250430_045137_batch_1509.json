You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, with <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> that used to bring you joy. This <quote>heavy sadness</quote> that follows you around is really affecting your daily life, making it hard to connect with others or find meaning in activities. Your <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> are also taking a toll, making everyday situations feel overwhelming. It's clear that the accident has had a profound impact on your mental health, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., loss of interest, feelings of sadness, hopelessness) and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (e.g., irritability, anxiety, fear, panic attacks) that are consistent with <med>PTSD</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>heavy sadness</quote> and <sym>disconnection</sym> from activities and others are indicative of <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (e.g., avoiding driving, discussing the accident) and <sym>intrusive memories</sym> (e.g., nightmares) are characteristic of <med>PTSD</med>. The patient's <sym>substance use</sym> (increased alcohol use) may be a coping mechanism.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>PTSD symptoms</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. <med>Trauma-focused therapy</med> to process and cope with the accident and its aftermath.\n3. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications) to manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and reduce <sym>nightmares</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
