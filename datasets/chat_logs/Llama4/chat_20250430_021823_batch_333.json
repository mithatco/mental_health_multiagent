They report a constant sense of being on edge, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>difficulty concentrating</sym>. The patient also experiences <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoids certain situations due to <sym>anxiety</sym>. They express feelings of being detached from themselves and others, and a sense of hopelessness. As they put it, <quote>\"it's like my world is getting smaller\"</quote>. Their sleep is affected, and they experience physical symptoms such as tension and aches. The patient's responses indicate a complex interplay of <med>anxiety</med> and <med>depressive</med> symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> due to the persistent worry (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8). The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest</sym> (Q1), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2) suggests <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The repetitive thoughts (Q16) and compulsions (Q17) could indicate <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, but they seem less prominent. The patient's dissociative symptoms (Q18) and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without intent or plan necessitate careful monitoring and comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **In-depth Clinical Interview**: Conduct a detailed interview to gather more information on the patient's symptoms, their onset, and impact on functioning.\n2. **Psychological Testing**: Consider administering standardized measures for <med>GAD</med>, <med>MDD</med>, and <med>OCD</med> to quantify symptom severity.\n3. **Medical Evaluation**: Refer for a medical check-up to rule out underlying conditions contributing to symptoms.\n4. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Recommend <med>CBT</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>OCD symptoms</sym>.\n5. **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> under the guidance of a psychiatrist, considering the patient's symptom profile.\n6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Suggest <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation exercises</med> to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.",
