The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I mean, I still find some joy in certain activities, but it's not as much as before. I've been so worried about having panic attacks that it's hard to focus on what I used to love doing."

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Overwhelming feelings of anxiety and panic\n- Recurring panic attacks with intense fear of losing control or experiencing a terrible event\n- Avoidance behaviors due to fear of having panic attacks in public or certain situations\n- Depressive symptoms, including feeling down, hopeless, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Physical symptoms such as aches, pains, and cardiovascular symptoms during and between panic attacks\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and fear related to panic attacks and their consequences\n- Significant avoidance behaviors impacting daily life and relationships\n- Co-occurring depressive symptoms\n- Physical complaints and concerns about health\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Recurring panic attacks, fear of having future attacks, and significant avoidance behaviors suggest a diagnosis of Panic Disorder.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Feelings of hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and changes in sleep and energy levels indicate possible co-morbid depression.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Significant trouble falling and staying asleep, likely related to anxiety.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms:** Some responses suggest possible dissociative symptoms (e.g., feeling detached from oneself during attacks).\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient has had thoughts of hurting themselves during panic attacks, indicating a risk for suicidal behavior.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient does not report significant alcohol or drug use, the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism (\"try and relax\") might be a concern.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with symptoms consistent with Panic Disorder, characterized by recurrent panic attacks and significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. Co-occurring symptoms of depression and sleep disturbances are noted. The patient reports a history of panic attacks with intense fear of losing control, avoidance behaviors, and significant physical symptoms. Suicidal ideation is present, indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and management. The clinical picture suggests a complex presentation requiring a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses anxiety, potential depressive disorder, sleep disturbances, and coping mechanisms.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for other potential co-morbid conditions.\n- Development of a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for panic disorder and depression) and pharmacotherapy.\n- Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and risk management strategies.\n- Psychoeducation on anxiety management and coping skills.",
