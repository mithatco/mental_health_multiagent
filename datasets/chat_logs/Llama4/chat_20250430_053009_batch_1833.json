The patient reports a pattern of avoidance coping, substance use, and emotional distress, which may indicate underlying anxiety and depressive disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use-related risks necessitates further exploration and assessment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should be developed to address these concerns.",

However, there were a few abrupt transitions (e.g., moving from question 10 to 11), and the therapist could have probed deeper in some areas to clarify or expand on the patient's responses.",

The therapist could have been more attuned to the patient's emotional state and acknowledged their distress more explicitly, particularly when the patient disclosed concerning symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, substance use)."
