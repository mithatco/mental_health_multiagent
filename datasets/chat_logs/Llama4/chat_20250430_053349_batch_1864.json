I'm going to be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to take your time to answer each one. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of suicidal ideation and substance use indicate a need for careful risk assessment and management. The presence of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors suggests potential PTSD symptoms, which may be related to a traumatic event (not explicitly stated but hinted at in Q7). Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's reports of cognitive difficulties, including memory problems and intrusive thoughts, may also impact daily functioning and require attention. Overall, the patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a high level of distress and impairment, warranting comprehensive clinical evaluation and intervention.",
