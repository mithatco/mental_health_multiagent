      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a really tough time lately, feeling down and anxious, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are terrifying and unpredictable. You mentioned feeling like you're constantly on edge, worried about having another attack, and avoiding situations that make you anxious. It's clear that these symptoms are significantly impacting your daily life and relationships. You expressed feelings of frustration, hopelessness, and a sense of being overwhelmed. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (Panic Disorder) and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, characterized by recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, fear of having another attack, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> expressed, although not acted upon, warrants careful consideration. A comprehensive evaluation is needed to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a more in-depth diagnostic interview and mental status examination.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to help manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Develop a crisis plan, including emergency contact numbers and a support system, to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure safety.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>mood changes</sym>, facilitating more effective treatment planning.",
