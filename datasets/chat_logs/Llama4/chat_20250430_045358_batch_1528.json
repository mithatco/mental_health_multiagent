This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive disorders: patient's reports of depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2) and changes in sleep patterns (Q4, Q14) suggest potential depressive disorder.\n* Anxiety disorders: patient's reports of anxiety symptoms (Q6, Q7, Q8) and avoidance behaviors suggest potential anxiety disorder.\n* Somatic symptom disorder: patient's reports of physical complaints (Q9) and concerns about their illnesses (Q10) suggest potential somatic symptom disorder.\n\n**4.

The patient's reports suggest potential depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as somatic symptom disorder. The patient's experiences of anxiety and panic symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and repetitive behaviors may be indicative of an anxiety-related disorder. The patient's reports of feeling disconnected from others and lacking a sense of purpose (Q19, Q20) suggest potential concerns about their relationships and overall well-being. Overall, the patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a need for further evaluation and potential treatment to address their mental health needs.",
