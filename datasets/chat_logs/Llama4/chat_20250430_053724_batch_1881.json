Each question was asked and answered, and the therapist provided appropriate follow-up questions based on the patient's responses. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling anxious and worried about what people think of them, the therapist explored this further by asking about social situations and anxiety. The only potential area for improvement is that some follow-up questions could have been more probing, but overall, the coverage was thorough.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clinically accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist directly referenced the DSM-5 criteria. The questions were clear and relevant, demonstrating a strong understanding of the DSM-5 framework.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For example, after the patient discussed feeling anxious in social situations, the therapist logically followed up with questions about avoiding such situations and feelings of nervousness. The conversation had no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's responses, and the reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as anxiety in social situations, avoidance of social gatherings, and fear of being judged. The justification was comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses were implicitly ruled out through the assessment process.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly impersonal or overly clinical. For example, when the patient mentioned feeling disconnected or distant from themselves, the therapist could have offered more emotional validation. However, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and acknowledged the patient's distress."
