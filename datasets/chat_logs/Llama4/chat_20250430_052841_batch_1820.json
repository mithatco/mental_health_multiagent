The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health.

The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Even simple things like watching TV or going for a walk feel like a chore.\"</quote> It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> (e.g., back pain, headaches) are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <quote>\"constant sadness\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like there's no point to anything\"</quote> suggest a significant depressive episode. While anxiety symptoms are also present, they appear to be secondary to the depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a mental health professional to further assess and address the patient's depressive symptoms.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage depressive symptoms.\n3. Develop a <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> plan to address negative thought patterns, improve coping skills, and enhance problem-solving abilities.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and improve mood.\n5. Consider a referral to a <med>sleep specialist</med> to address the patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and develop strategies for improving sleep quality.",
