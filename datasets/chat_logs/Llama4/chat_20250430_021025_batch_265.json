Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Specifically, the patient's reports of <quote>\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual\"</quote> suggest <sym>negative alterations in cognition and mood</sym>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>hypervigilance</sym> and <sym>exaggerated startle response</sym> are consistent with <sym>marked alterations in arousal and reactivity</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> with a focus on trauma and <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n2. <med>Medications</med> such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be considered to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. <med>Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> to address <sym>trauma-related symptoms</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n5.
