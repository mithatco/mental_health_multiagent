Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here.\") indicates a potential risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n2. **Social Isolation:** The patient's social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors (Q8, Q20) may exacerbate existing symptoms and increase the risk of depression and anxiety.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by depressive, anxiety, and sleep-related symptoms. The patient's negative affect, avoidance behaviors, and social withdrawal are concerning and may indicate a risk for further symptom exacerbation. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively planned, necessitates careful assessment and monitoring. Further evaluation and potential referral to specialized care may be warranted to address these clinical concerns.",
