The patient's suicidal ideation and substance use are notable risk factors that require immediate attention. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of detachment from others suggest potential interpersonal difficulties. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n* Anxiety Disorder (NOS)\n* Substance Use Disorder (SUD)\n* Other conditions may be considered based on further evaluation and assessment.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses\n* Development of a treatment plan addressing depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and substance use\n* Crisis intervention and safety planning to address suicidal ideation\n* Consideration of therapy and/or medication to manage symptoms and improve overall mental health.",
