The presence of significant <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic</sym>, and avoidance behaviors further supports co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> features.

Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses both depressive and anxiety symptoms, potentially including <med>psychotherapy</med> and <med>medication</med>.\n3. Implement safety planning to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including regular check-ins and crisis intervention strategies.\n4. Encourage <sym>social support</sym> from friends, family, or support groups to help alleviate feelings of isolation.\n5. Monitor and address <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, such as back pain and headaches, as part of the treatment plan.",
