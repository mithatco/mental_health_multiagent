This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. We're going to go through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this process as comfortable as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their reports of intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and avoidance behaviors suggest potential diagnoses of OCD and anxiety disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation and dissociative symptoms highlights the need for careful risk assessment and treatment planning. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific needs and concerns are warranted.",

You've been experiencing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> like feeling down, hopeless, and irritable, which can be really overwhelming. It's clear that <quote>anxiety is a big part of what brings me here</quote>, and you've been dealing with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, you've been struggling with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and compulsions, which can be distressing. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress**\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17). Additionally, their reports of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2) and <sym>anxious distress</sym> (Q6, Q7) meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, including <sym>panic attacks</sym> and avoidance behaviors, further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of OCD and MDD.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for OCD symptoms.\n3. Consideration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n5. Encouragement of self-care activities, such as mindfulness and relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.",
