The reasoning provided was clinically sound and comprehensive.",

The therapist demonstrated a deep understanding of the patient's symptoms and effectively used the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to guide the assessment. The conversation was logically structured, and the therapist's empathetic approach helped the patient feel heard and understood. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was well-supported by the patient's symptoms, and the recommended next steps were comprehensive and clinically appropriate.",

You described a constant sadness that feels overwhelming <quote>\"like there's this constant sadness that I just can't shake off\"</quote>, and at times, hopelessness about the future <sym>hopelessness</sym>. Your sleep has been disrupted, waking up early and not being able to fall back asleep <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which affects your whole day. You're also experiencing anxiety <sym>anxiety</sym> and worry, feeling like you're just trying to get through each day without much motivation or energy.

The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan increases the risk and necessitates immediate attention. The patient's reports of <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, such as memory problems, and <sym>anxiety</sym> further support this diagnosis. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for MDD include a depressed mood or loss of interest in activities for at least two weeks, which seems to be the case here.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that might be contributing to the symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive symptoms, improve coping strategies, and enhance relationships.\n3. **Pharmacotherapy:** Evaluate the need for <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n4. **Sleep Hygiene:** Provide guidance on improving <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> to help regulate sleep patterns.\n5. **Crisis Intervention:** Given the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, ensure immediate access to crisis support and closely monitor for any increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n6. **Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to assess progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
