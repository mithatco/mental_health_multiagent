      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of nervousness and anxiety in social situations, which can be really tough to deal with. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not always feeling like initiating activities, and that you've had moments where you feel down, especially after social interactions that didn't go well. You also experience physical symptoms like blushing, sweating, and a shaky voice in social situations, which can be overwhelming. It's clear that these experiences are affecting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>nervousness</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>self-consciousness</sym> in social situations, as well as their avoidance of social situations that cause anxiety, meet potential criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, their reports of feeling down, especially after social interactions, may indicate a co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med>. However, the primary symptoms and concerns presented suggest <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative self-talk</sym> and <sym>rumination</sym> associated with social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations that currently cause anxiety.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym> in daily life.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or other medications to help manage symptoms of social anxiety and depression.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
