Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Reports of hopelessness, anhedonia, and irritability suggest a possible depressive disorder. Anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks and avoidance behaviors, are prominent. The patient's experiences of disconnection and detachment may indicate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances further support the presence of mental health concerns. The patient's report of suicidal ideation and excessive drinking elevate the risk profile.

The justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",
