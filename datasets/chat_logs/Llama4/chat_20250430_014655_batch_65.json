      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of being stuck, <sym>low mood</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> at times, which can be really overwhelming. You also experience periods of high energy and impulsivity, which can be challenging to manage. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil, and it's affecting your relationships and daily life. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>mood swings</sym>, <sym>impulsivity</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> suggest a complex clinical presentation. The patient's reports of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> and <sym>manic-like symptoms</sym> (e.g., increased energy, impulsivity) meet the criteria for a <med>bipolar disorder</med>. The <med>mixed features</med> specifier is warranted given the presence of both depressive and manic symptoms in the same episode.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med> to help regulate mood and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n3. Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to develop coping skills and improve emotional regulation.\n4. Encourage the patient to maintain a <med>mood journal</med> to track symptoms and identify triggers.\n5. Consider <med>group therapy</med> or <med>support groups</med> to provide additional support and connection.",
