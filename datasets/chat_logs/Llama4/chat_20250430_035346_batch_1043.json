The therapist provided a clear rationale for the diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Anxiety Disorder, and Substance Use Disorder, directly citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the tone seemed slightly impersonal or overly technical. For example, when discussing the patient's substance use, the therapist could have been more empathetic and less clinical. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's emotional state."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing the patient's mental health using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, and the diagnostic justifications were clear and clinically sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise phrasing of questions and increased empathy in certain moments, the overall performance was strong. The therapist's ability to maintain a logical flow and provide clear diagnoses makes this a very effective assessment conversation.",
