You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and enjoying hobbies and spending time with close friends, but not really seeking out new experiences or activities. You also shared that you feel down or depressed after social events, and that you've been experiencing physical symptoms like blushing, sweating, and trembling in these situations. <quote>I'm really struggling with social situations</quote> . It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>avoidance</sym>, and physical symptoms in social situations are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of feeling down or depressed, especially after social events, suggest potential <med>depressive symptoms</med>, but they do not appear to be severe enough to meet the criteria for a <med>depressive disorder</med>. The patient's negative self-talk and self-criticism may be a concern for future mental health risks.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Consideration of <med>exposure therapy</med> to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3.
