Your anxiety levels have been high, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and a constant fear of something bad happening. You've also mentioned <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> that are affecting your daily life. It's clear that you're finding it challenging to cope with these feelings and experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> (provisional).\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to the reported <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, changes in sleep, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>. The presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> supports a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>, although further evaluation is needed to confirm this.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a detailed diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnoses and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med>, to address the patient's <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>obsessive-compulsive</sym> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their experiences and identify patterns.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n6. Consider referring the patient to a <med>therapist</med> or <med>counselor</med> for ongoing support and guidance.",
