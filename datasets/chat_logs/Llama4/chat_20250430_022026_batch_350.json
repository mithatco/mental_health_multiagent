The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health and identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You described feeling <quote>\"sad and hopeless\"</quote> and <quote>\"on edge\"</quote> most of the time. Your sleep has been really inconsistent, and you're experiencing <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> like memory and concentration problems. You're also struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, which is affecting your relationships with loved ones. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm taking your concerns seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a significant presence of depressive symptoms, including <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2). Anxiety symptoms are also evident, with reports of <sym>nervousness</sym> (Q6), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> (Q8). The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and the anxious distress specifier is warranted given the significant anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic interview and mental status examination to confirm the diagnosis and assess symptom severity.\n2. Consider referring the patient to a therapist for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, if deemed necessary.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and anxiety.\n5. Consider referring the patient to a <med>psychiatrist</med> or <med>psychologist</med> for ongoing treatment and support.",
