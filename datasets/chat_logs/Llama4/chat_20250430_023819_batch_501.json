Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Anxiety and panic attacks (Q6, Q7)\n- Irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n- Physical symptoms during panic attacks (Q9)\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment and dissociation (Q18)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A significant pattern involves anxiety and panic attacks, which seem to be central to the patient's symptomatology, influencing mood, sleep, social interactions, and overall quality of life.\n- The patient experiences both psychological and physical symptoms, indicating a complex presentation that may require a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurring panic attacks, persistent worry about having panic attacks, and avoidance of situations due to fear of panic.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the presence of intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment could suggest trauma, which warrants further exploration.\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Indicates a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11) without a clear plan or intent, indicating a need for careful assessment and monitoring.\n- Significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by co-occurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively planned, necessitates a cautious approach and immediate attention to safety concerns. The patient's experiences of panic attacks, with associated physical and psychological symptoms, have significantly impacted daily functioning, leading to social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors. The clinical impression suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including the possibility of trauma assessment, and development of a tailored treatment plan that addresses both immediate safety concerns and longer-term therapeutic goals. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- 296.32 Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Single Episode\n- 300.21 Panic Disorder\n- 309.28 Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth clinical interview to further assess symptom history and potential trauma.\n- Mental status exam.\n- Assessment of suicide risk and development of a safety plan.\n- Possible referral for additional assessments (e.g., trauma-focused, cognitive).\n- Consideration of both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.",

It's clear that these symptoms have been affecting not just your mood but also your relationships and daily functioning. You mentioned feeling like you're \"constantly on edge\" and worried about having another panic attack, which makes it hard for you to enjoy life or even leave the house sometimes. Your descriptions paint a picture of someone who is really struggling and in need of support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>, given the recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having panic attacks, and avoidance of situations due to fear of panic. Additionally, the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggests co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> could indicate trauma, but more information is needed to confirm <med>PTSD</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> necessitates immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure patient safety.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med> such as SSRIs or SNRIs for both anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n4. Recommend <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to address anxiety, depressive symptoms, and coping skills.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track panic attacks and mood changes.\n6. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary.",
