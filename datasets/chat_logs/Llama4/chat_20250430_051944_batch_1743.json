I'm here to support you, and I'm using a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to help us understand your current mental health. This is a self-rated assessment that will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and adjustment difficulties following a recent divorce and relocation. Primary concerns include:\n\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Anxiety and panic attacks (Q6, Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors (Q8)\n- Somatic complaints (Q9)\n- Suicidal ideation without intent or plan (Q11)\n- Cognitive difficulties (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment and identity confusion (Q18, Q19)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Emotional Distress**: The patient reports pervasive feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety.\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: Both excessive sleeping and poor sleep quality are noted.\n- **Cognitive Impairment**: The patient experiences difficulties with concentration, memory, and decision-making.\n- **Social Withdrawal**: There's a clear pattern of avoiding social situations and feeling disconnected from others.\n- **Physical Symptoms**: Frequent headaches, stomachaches, and overall tension are reported.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Symptoms of depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death.\n- **Anxiety Disorders**: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and panic disorder are suggested by symptoms of excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Adjustment Disorder**: The patient's symptoms seem to have emerged in response to significant life changes (divorce and relocation).\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Although not directly indicated, feelings of detachment and intrusive thoughts could suggest a stress-related disorder.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves but denies intent or plan. This is a significant risk factor that warrants immediate attention and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use**: While the patient denies using substances to cope, the use of alcohol (wine) might be explored further as a coping mechanism.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, likely meeting criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and possibly an anxiety disorder. Recent life stressors (divorce and relocation) appear to have triggered these symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitates careful assessment and management. Cognitive impairments, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal further underscore the severity of the patient's mental health challenges. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and the development of a tailored treatment plan are warranted. \n\nThe patient would benefit from a multifaceted treatment approach, potentially including psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, IPT) and pharmacotherapy, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms, improve coping strategies, and enhance overall functioning. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and implementation of safety measures are essential components of the treatment plan. \n\n**DSM-5** Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure highlights significant distress and impairment across multiple domains, suggesting a need for comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and intervention.",

You also mentioned feeling <sym>sad</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> a lot, and that you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym>. It's clear that you're facing significant emotional distress and could benefit from support and guidance.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness</sym>.

The recent stressors of divorce and relocation appear to have triggered these symptoms, suggesting an adjustment disorder component as well.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Initiate a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation to confirm the diagnoses and assess for any additional mental health conditions.\n2.
