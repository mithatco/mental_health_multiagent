The therapist explored depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, identity and relationships, and other key domains. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's symptoms.",

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist did not specifically inquire about the patient's sleep patterns in relation to mania. However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms effectively.",

The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's thoughts of hurting themselves and hearing voices. The conversation had a coherent and logical progression, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and panic episodes. The diagnostic justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",
