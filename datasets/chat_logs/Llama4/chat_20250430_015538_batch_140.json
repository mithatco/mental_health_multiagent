Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a confidential and safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Please feel free to express yourself in as much detail as you'd like. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

It's been hard to find the motivation to do much of anything lately, and even when I do, it doesn't feel as fulfilling as it used to. I guess it's been more than half the days, but some days are worse than others."

The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitates a thorough risk assessment and immediate intervention. The clinical picture warrants a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, focusing on mood stabilization, anxiety management, and addressing underlying psychological distress. Collaboration with other healthcare professionals may be necessary to ensure a holistic approach to care.",
