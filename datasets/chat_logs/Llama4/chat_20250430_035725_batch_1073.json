I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's symptoms indicate significant distress and impairment across multiple domains, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and cognitive functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use highlights the need for careful risk assessment and management.
