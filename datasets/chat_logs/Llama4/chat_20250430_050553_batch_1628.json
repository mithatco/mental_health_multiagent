The patient also reports sleep disturbances, physical symptoms during panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors. Risk factors for suicidal behavior and repetitive behaviors are also present. Further assessment and evaluation are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses**\n\n* Anxiety Disorder (e.g., GAD, Panic Disorder)\n* Depressive Disorder (e.g., MDD)\n* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n* Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses.\n2. Assess for trauma history and PTSD symptoms.\n3.
