This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this process as comfortable as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling like you're \"pretending to be someone I'm not\" and that it's \"really lonely.\" <quote>I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life, and that's scary</quote>. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> in social situations, which aligns with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Specifically, you reported feeling <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>frightened</sym> in social situations (Q6, Q7), and that you avoid these situations (Q8). Additionally, your <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>down</sym> and <sym>hopeless</sym> (Q2), may be secondary to your social anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to gradually help you become comfortable in social situations that trigger <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> management.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
