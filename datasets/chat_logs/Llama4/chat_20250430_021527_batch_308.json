This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to answer as thoroughly as you can. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've described a constant cloud of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> that follows you everywhere, making it hard to find enthusiasm for daily activities. Your <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> are heightened, and you're experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym> that feel terrifying. You're also dealing with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>memory problems</sym>, and feelings of detachment from yourself and others. It's clear that you're finding it challenging to cope with daily life, and your relationships are suffering as a result.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> across multiple domains, including work, health, and family. You've reported <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are all consistent with <med>GAD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>rumination</sym> suggest a possible comorbid <med>Depressive Disorder</med>, but the primary symptoms appear to be driven by <med>anxiety</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>GAD</med> and rule out other potential diagnoses, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>maladaptive coping mechanisms</sym>.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Development of a self-care plan, including stress management techniques, such as <quote>meditation</quote> and <quote>deep breathing exercises</quote>, to help regulate <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve overall well-being.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
