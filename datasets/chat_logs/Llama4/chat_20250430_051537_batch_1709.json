This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

However, these were minor inaccuracies and did not significantly impact the clinical relevance.",
