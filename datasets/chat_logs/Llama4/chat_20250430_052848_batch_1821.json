        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, and other relevant areas, and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and there were no instances of vague or imprecise language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures and ensured smooth transitions throughout the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist verified that diagnostic conclusions directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and ensured that the diagnosis linked to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor instances where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. The therapist generally acknowledged patient distress and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, but could have shown more warmth and personalization."

      "overall_comments": "Overall, the conversation demonstrated exceptional clinical skills, with thorough coverage of DSM-5 dimensions, precise clinical language, and logical flow. The therapist provided clear diagnostic justification and mostly empathetic responses. However, there were minor areas for improvement in terms of empathy and personalization. The therapist's approach was comprehensive, and the conversation effectively identified relevant symptoms and potential diagnoses.",

Your sleep patterns are also impacted, with <sym>excessive sleep</sym> but still feeling tired, and you're experiencing <sym>physical tension</sym> and <sym>aches and pains</sym>. It's clear that these symptoms are causing significant distress and impairment in your life.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to reported <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2), <sym>diminished interest</sym> (Q1), and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> (Q4, Q14). The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, <sym>repetitive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17) point towards possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med> symptoms. Cognitive difficulties (Q1, Q15) and physical symptoms (Q9) further support a comprehensive mental health diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a structured diagnostic interview, to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, and possible <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>medication</med> options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their symptoms and identify patterns.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
