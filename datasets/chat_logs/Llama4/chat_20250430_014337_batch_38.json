This is a confidential and safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by intent or plan, necessitate close monitoring and risk assessment. The patient's avoidance behaviors, cognitive difficulties, and hopelessness/helplessness also contribute to a high level of distress and impairment. Further assessment and diagnostic evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's responses suggest a high level of clinical significance, and a comprehensive treatment plan should be developed to address these concerns.",
