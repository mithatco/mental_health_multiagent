The patient's responses suggest a high level of distress and impairment in daily functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by a plan, warrants careful assessment and monitoring.

You're also experiencing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and frustration, which can be really overwhelming. <quote>I feel like a weight is on my chest</quote>. It's clear that these emotions are affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic episodes</sym> suggests a high level of anxious distress. Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>unexplained aches and pains</sym> and concerns about their illnesses not being taken seriously enough may indicate <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. In-depth diagnostic interview to further assess symptoms and identify underlying causes.\n2. Comprehensive psychological and medical evaluation to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n3. Development of a treatment plan addressing depressive, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, as well as suicidal ideation and risk factors.\n4. Consideration of therapy, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address symptoms and improve coping skills.\n5. Possible medication evaluation for <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med> to help manage symptoms.",
