Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressed mood (Q2: \"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\")\n* Anhedonia (Q1: \"little interest or pleasure in doing things\")\n* Anxiety (Q6: \"feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge\")\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4: \"sleeping less than usual,\" Q14: \"problems with sleep\")\n* Avoidance behaviors (Q8: \"avoiding situations that make you anxious\")\n* Intrusive thoughts/images (Q16: \"unpleasant thoughts, urges, or images\")\n* Feelings of detachment and dissociation (Q18: \"feeling detached or distant from yourself\")\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports a significant decrease in interest and pleasure in activities, suggesting anhedonia.\n* Depressed mood, anxiety, and sleep disturbances are prominent symptoms.\n* Avoidance behaviors and intrusive thoughts/images related to a specific event (the accident) are reported.\n* The patient experiences feelings of detachment, dissociation, and disconnection from themselves and others.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): anhedonia, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and decreased interest in activities.\n* Anxiety Disorders: anxiety, panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and fear of situations that may trigger anxiety.\n* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): intrusive thoughts/images, avoidance behaviors, and negative changes in mood and cognition.\n* Dissociative Disorders: feelings of detachment, dissociation, and disconnection from self and others.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation (Q11: \"thoughts of actually hurting yourself\"): The patient reports feeling overwhelmed and having thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore, although they deny having a plan.\n* Substance use (Q21: \"drinking at least 4 drinks of any kind of alcohol\"): The patient reports increased alcohol use, potentially as a coping mechanism.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex symptom profile, suggesting multiple areas of clinical concern. Depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and sleep disturbances are prominent symptoms. The patient's reports of avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts/images, and negative changes in mood and cognition may indicate a trauma-related disorder, such as PTSD. Additionally, the patient's feelings of detachment, dissociation, and disconnection from themselves and others warrant further exploration. The presence of suicidal ideation and increased substance use are significant risk factors that require immediate attention and safety planning. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan addressing these concerns are necessary.",

You've described a heaviness that doesn't go away, <sym>depressed mood</sym> that's affecting your sleep and leaving you with <sym>nightmares</sym>. You're also experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, feeling like you're constantly on edge and waiting for something else bad to happen. You've shared that you've been having <sym>panic attacks</sym> and feeling like you're detached from yourself and others. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, with <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> being prominent. The <sym>intrusive thoughts/images</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to a specific event (the accident) are highly suggestive of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym> are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> also support a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <quote>\"heaviness that doesn't go away\"</quote> and <quote>\"feeling like I'm just going through the motions\"</quote> further support the <med>MDD</med> diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>, potentially including <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications).\n3. Explore <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> or <med>eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to maintain a <med>sleep diary</med> to monitor sleep disturbances and identify potential triggers.\n5. Consider <med>group therapy</med> or <med>support groups</med> to provide additional support and connection.",
