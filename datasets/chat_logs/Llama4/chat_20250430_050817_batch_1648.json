        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure with appropriate depth. Each question was followed up when needed, and no dimensions were skipped. The therapist systematically addressed all domains, asking about depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, substance use, sleep, etc., and followed up with appropriate probing when the patient mentioned concerning symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist could have used more precise language. However, overall, the questions were clinically accurate and targeted the relevant symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and provided coherent follow-up questions. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs in the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria. The differential diagnosis was comprehensively considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few minor instances of slightly impersonal language. For example, when discussing 'substance use,' the therapist could have been more empathetic. However, overall, the interactions were warm and personalized."
