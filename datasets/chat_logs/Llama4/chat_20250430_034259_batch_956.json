      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, and that there are times when you just don't feel like doing anything. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions of life, and that your depressive episodes can be really overwhelming. You also shared that you experience manic episodes, where you feel like you're on top of the world, but others can't keep up with you. It's clear that you're facing significant challenges with your mental health, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, as reported through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, suggest a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient experiences <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> (Q14). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>manic episodes</sym> with <sym>increased energy</sym> (Q4), <sym>reduced need for sleep</sym> (Q4), and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> (Q5). These symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, and further evaluation is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule an in-depth diagnostic evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses, including <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a crisis plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, including emergency contact numbers and a safe support network.\n3. Collaborate with other healthcare professionals to ensure comprehensive care, including a therapist, psychiatrist, or other specialists as needed.\n4. Consider medication and therapy options, such as <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antidepressants</med>, and <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT) or <med>family-focused therapy</med> (FFT).\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a symptom journal to track their mood, sleep patterns, and behaviors, which can help identify triggers and patterns.",
