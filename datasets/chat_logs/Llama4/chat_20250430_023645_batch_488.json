However, the justification could have been strengthened by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses, such as Somatic Symptom Disorder, and providing a more detailed differential diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, with appropriate professional tone. However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more emotionally attuned, such as when the patient mentioned feeling like 'it would be easier if I wasn't here.'

You're also experiencing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and frustration, which can be really overwhelming. <quote>I feel like I'm not doing anything right</quote>. Your sleep is affected, and you're waking up early in the morning, feeling anxious and worried about various aspects of your life. It's clear that you're finding it challenging to cope with daily life, and you're not feeling close to others or enjoying your relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> suggests co-occurring symptoms that may need to be addressed. The patient's <quote>feelings of emptiness</quote> and <quote>not knowing who I really am or what I want out of life</quote> also suggest potential <med>identity issues</med> or <med>existential concerns</med>. While <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med> could be considered, the patient's symptoms do not seem to be primarily focused on their physical health.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>pharmacological interventions</med> to address <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them joy and help them connect with others, such as <med>social support groups</med> or <med>hobbies</med>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms, treatment progress, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consider <med>referral to a specialist</med>, such as a <med>psychiatrist</med> or <med>therapist</med>, if the patient's symptoms worsen or do not respond to initial treatment.",
