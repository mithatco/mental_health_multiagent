          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Lack of interest in activities (Q1), feelings of sadness and hopelessness (Q2), irritability (Q3), and fatigue (Q4).\n- **Anxiety Symptoms:** Persistent worry (Q6), panic episodes (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n- **Physical Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains (Q9), physical tension, and sleep disturbances (Q10, Q14).\n- **Psychological Distress:** Feelings of detachment (Q18), identity issues (Q19), and interpersonal relationship challenges (Q20).\n\n### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses\n\n- **Predominant Mood and Anxiety Symptoms:** The patient consistently reports symptoms related to depression (e.g., loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness) and anxiety (e.g., worry, panic, avoidance).\n- **Somatic Complaints:** Frequent physical symptoms such as tension, aches, and pains, alongside sleep disturbances.\n- **Self-Perception and Relationships:** The patient feels disconnected from self and others, indicating possible identity and interpersonal relationship issues.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms, panic episodes, and social avoidance.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Multiple unexplained physical complaints.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Possible given the mention of feeling \"on edge\" and detached, though specific trauma isn't reported.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient mentions feeling overwhelmed and trapped (Q11), indicating a need for further assessment of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n- **Substance Use:** Past attempts at self-medication with alcohol or marijuana, suggesting a potential for substance use disorder.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms indicative of depression and anxiety disorders, along with somatic complaints and interpersonal relationship challenges. There is a notable pattern of avoidance behaviors, both socially and in terms of engaging in activities, likely due to anxiety and depressive symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation and past substance use for self-medication are critical risk factors that necessitate immediate attention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, potentially including therapy and medication. \n\n**DSM-5 Diagnosis Considerations:** Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and possible Somatic Symptom Disorder. Further evaluation for PTSD and substance use disorders is also necessary.\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication for depression and anxiety (e.g., SSRIs), and a focus on improving sleep hygiene and coping strategies. Close monitoring for suicidal ideation and substance use is crucial. \n\n**Next Steps:** A detailed diagnostic interview, possibly supplemented with additional assessment tools (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7), and consideration of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's multifaceted needs.",

The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state.

The presence of <sym>persistent worry</sym>, <sym>panic episodes</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The combination of these conditions, along with <sym>somatic complaints</sym> and <sym>interpersonal relationship challenges</sym>, suggests a complex clinical presentation that requires comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1.
