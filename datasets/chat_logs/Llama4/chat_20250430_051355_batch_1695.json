This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll ask you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll make sure to guide you through the process. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You feel stuck in a cycle of anxiety and guilt, and it's affecting your relationships and daily life. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to manage these symptoms and improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16), <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17), and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6-Q8), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>OCD</med>. The patient's reports of feeling stuck in a cycle of thoughts and compulsions, as well as their avoidance of situations that trigger anxiety, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1-Q2) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) may be related to the <med>OCD</med> diagnosis or may indicate co-occurring conditions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), to address <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Regular therapy sessions to monitor progress, address any co-occurring conditions, and provide support.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a symptom journal to track their <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym>, which can help identify patterns and triggers.\n5. Consider referral to a mental health specialist or a <med>OCD</med> support group to provide additional resources and support.",
