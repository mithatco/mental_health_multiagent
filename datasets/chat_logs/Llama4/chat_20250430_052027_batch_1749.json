      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with significant mood swings, feeling down and hopeless at times, while also experiencing periods of increased energy and impulsivity. You mentioned feeling like you're \"in a fog\" and can't get out of it, and that you've been having trouble sleeping, sometimes sleeping only a few hours but still feeling energetic, and other times sleeping too much. These fluctuations in mood and energy sound incredibly challenging and exhausting. You've also shared feelings of anxiety, being on edge, and worried about something going wrong. It's clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I'm here to support you and help navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> with mixed features, given the presence of both depressive symptoms (<sym>feelings of hopelessness, little interest or pleasure in activities</sym>) and manic/hypomanic symptoms (<sym>increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity</sym>). The <quote>feeling like I'm in a fog and can't get out of it</quote> and <quote>being really down</quote> align with depressive episodes, while <quote>feeling like I can take on the world</quote> and engaging in impulsive behaviors (<quote>buying a car on impulse</quote>) suggest manic/hypomanic episodes. The co-occurrence of these symptoms supports a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder, Mixed Features</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: Schedule a thorough evaluation with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Medication: Consider <med>mood stabilizers</med> or <med>antipsychotics</med> to help regulate mood and reduce symptoms of mania and depression.\n3. Psychotherapy: Engage in <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to develop coping skills, manage emotions, and improve relationships.\n4. Lifestyle modifications: Encourage regular sleep schedules, healthy eating, and stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or exercise, to help regulate mood and reduce symptoms.\n5. Substance use counseling: Address <sym>substance use</sym> and provide guidance on responsible use or cessation, if necessary.",
