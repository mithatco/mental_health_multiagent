This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your well-being across different psychiatric domains. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Internalizing symptoms, such as intrusive thoughts and compulsions, are prominent. The patient's reports suggest potential clinical significance in the areas of MDD, anxiety disorders, OCD, and Sleep-Wake Disorders. Suicidal ideation and internalizing symptoms are notable risk factors. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are warranted to address these concerns.",
