The therapist explored depression, anxiety, anger, mania, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. The only potential area for improvement is that some questions could have been probed further, but overall, the coverage was comprehensive.",

The therapist did not alter questions in ways that changed their clinical meaning, and vague or imprecise language was not used. The questions were clinically relevant and appropriate for the assessment.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation, and explored symptoms in greater depth when needed. The conversational arc was coherent and smooth.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as low mood, anhedonia, and anxiety, to support the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress and possible Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Alternative diagnoses were not discussed, but the justification for the proposed diagnoses was comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and provided a supportive and non-judgmental space for them to share their experiences. The therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and the interaction was warm and personalized."
