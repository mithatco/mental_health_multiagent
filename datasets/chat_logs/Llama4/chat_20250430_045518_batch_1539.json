You've been experiencing a lot of sadness, and it's affecting your daily life. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just trying to get by\" and that it's hard to find pleasure in anything. You also shared that you've been having trouble sleeping, nightmares, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about a traumatic event. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>, and it's impacting your relationships with friends and family. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm taking your concerns seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical picture. The <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> point towards <med>PTSD</med>. The patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>feelings of being on edge</sym> are consistent with <med>GAD</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> as a coping mechanism further supports the need for comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough <med>PTSD</med> assessment using standardized tools, such as the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> and <med>prolonged exposure therapy</med> for <med>PTSD</med>.\n3. Address <med>MDD</med> symptoms with <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> or <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>.\n4. Implement <med>anxiety management techniques</med>, such as <med>mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)</med> and <med>relaxation training</med>.\n5. Monitor and address <sym>substance use</sym> through <med>substance use disorder treatment</med>, including <med>counseling</med> and <med>support groups</med>.\n6. Provide <quote>crisis intervention</quote> and <quote>suicidal prevention strategies</quote> given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.",
