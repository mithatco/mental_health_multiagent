The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively planned, necessitates immediate attention. The clinical picture suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including consideration of MDD, anxiety disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders. A collaborative treatment approach addressing these areas, with a focus on safety planning given the suicidal ideation, is warranted.",

You've described <sym>nightmares</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that seem to be constant companions, making everyday life challenging. Your feelings of being <quote>down, depressed, or hopeless</quote> are understandable given the <quote>weight on my chest</quote> you mentioned. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anger</sym> that seems to surface easily. Your attempts to find ways to manage these feelings, such as increased alcohol and marijuana use, are also concerning. I want you to know that I'm here to support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>PTSD</med> due to the reported <sym>nightmares</sym> (Q2, Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>negative alterations in mood and cognition</sym> (Q1, Q20), all of which seem to stem from a traumatic event. The presence of significant <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2) supports a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. Additionally, the patient's increased use of alcohol and marijuana (Q21, Q23) suggests a <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>, potentially as a maladaptive coping mechanism for their <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** Conduct a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnoses of <med>PTSD</med>, <med>MDD</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Trauma-Focused CBT:** Implement <med>CBT</med> and <med>Trauma-Focused CBT</med> to address <sym>PTSD</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Medication Management:** Consider <med>antidepressants</med> for <med>MDD</med> and <med>PTSD</med>, and <med>medications for anxiety</med> if necessary.\n4. **Substance Use Counseling:** Engage in <med>substance use counseling</med> to address alcohol and marijuana use, focusing on coping mechanisms and relapse prevention.\n5. **Safety Planning:** Develop a <med>safety plan</med> given the patient's <quote>feelings of hopelessness</quote> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, ensuring immediate support and resources are available.\n6. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
