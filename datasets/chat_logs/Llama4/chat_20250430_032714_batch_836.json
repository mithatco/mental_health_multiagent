The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), and that there are times when you just don't care about things you used to love (Q1). It's like you're caught in a cycle of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>, and it's hard to shake off those feelings. You also shared that you've been using substances without a doctor's prescription (Q23), which can add to the complexity of your situation. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these things.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses suggest that you're experiencing symptoms across multiple domains, including <sym>depression</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q8), and <sym>substance use</sym> (Q23). The frequency and severity of these symptoms, as well as their impact on your daily life, suggest that <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> could be potential diagnoses. Additionally, your report of using substances without a doctor's prescription (Q23) raises concerns about <med>Substance Use Disorder</med>. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation would be necessary to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation with a mental health professional to assess your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you address your <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> as potential therapeutic approaches to help you manage your symptoms.\n4. Develop a plan to address your <med>substance use</med>, including seeking support from a substance abuse counselor or support group.\n5. Consider <med>medication</med> as a potential adjunct to therapy, under the guidance of a qualified mental health professional.",
