The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan necessitates careful assessment and intervention. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, with possible comorbid sleep disorder. Comprehensive assessment, including a detailed diagnostic interview and consideration of psychosocial stressors, is warranted to guide treatment planning. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- 296.32 Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Single Episode\n- 300.02 Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- 780.52 Insomnia Disorder\n\n**Treatment Considerations:**\n- Psychotherapy (e.g., CBT, IPT) for depression and anxiety.\n- Sleep hygiene practices and possible pharmacotherapy for insomnia.\n- Ongoing assessment of suicidality and risk management strategies.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nFurther evaluation, including a thorough diagnostic interview and consideration of treatment options, is necessary to address the patient's complex presentation. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and coordination of care with other healthcare providers, as needed, is essential.",
