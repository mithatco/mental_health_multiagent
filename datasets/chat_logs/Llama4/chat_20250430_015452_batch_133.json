Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'feeling like I'm on top of the world,' the therapist followed up with questions about sleep patterns and impulsive behaviors, demonstrating a thorough exploration of the patient's symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For instance, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specifically defined what 'less than usual' means to ensure clarity. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively built on the patient's disclosures to guide the conversation. For example, after the patient mentioned 'dark thoughts,' the therapist immediately followed up with questions about suicidal ideation, demonstrating a coherent and responsive approach.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Unspecified, generally aligned with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like mood swings, depressive episodes, and impulsive behaviors to the diagnosis. However, there was minor ambiguity in the justification regarding the potential for co-occurring anxiety disorder, which could have been more thoroughly addressed.",
