Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This tool helps us understand a wide range of mental health symptoms you might be experiencing. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one at a time. Your responses will help us identify areas that might need further exploration or support. I'm here to listen without judgment, and I want to create a safe space for you to express yourself. Let's begin with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned that \"it's like nothing seems as fun or interesting anymore\" and that you're feeling \"really down and hopeless about the future.\" These <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> are coupled with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, making daily life challenging. Your reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>concentration problems</sym>, and <sym>memory issues</sym> further highlight the complexity of your situation. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope and are seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, including <quote>\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote> (Q2), <quote>\"little interest or pleasure in doing things\"</quote> (Q1), changes in sleep patterns (Q4), and <quote>\"feeling like my mind is foggy\"</quote> (Q15). The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without a plan or intent increases the risk and necessitates careful monitoring. While <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> are prominent, they appear to be part of the depressive symptomatology rather than a separate anxiety disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive symptoms and coping strategies.\n2. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n3. Develop a <med>crisis plan</med> to manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including emergency contact numbers and a safe environment.\n4. Encourage <med>relaxation techniques</med> and <med>stress management</med> strategies, such as mindfulness or meditation, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as necessary, and provide ongoing support.",
