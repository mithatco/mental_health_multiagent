You mentioned feeling like you're in a dark cloud that you can't get out of, and that it's hard to muster up the energy or interest to do things. <quote>It's like, I know I should be motivated, but I just can't seem to muster up the energy or interest</quote>.

The patient's history of <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>, <sym>high energy</sym>, and <sym>reduced sleep</sym> may indicate potential <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> traits. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm these impressions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a more in-depth diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history.\n2. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers, to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3.
