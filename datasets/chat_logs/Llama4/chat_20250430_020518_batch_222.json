Additionally, the patient's symptoms of anxiety, worry, and fear may be indicative of co-occurring <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <sym>mood symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>substance use</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as mood stabilizers or antidepressants, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Recommend <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to address coping skills and emotional regulation.\n5.
