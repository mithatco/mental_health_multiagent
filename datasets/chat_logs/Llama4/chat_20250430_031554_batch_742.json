Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Anxiety and worry (Q6, Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n- Somatic complaints (Q9)\n- Suicidal ideation (Q11)\n- Cognitive difficulties (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment and identity confusion (Q18, Q19)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- The patient reports a significant decline in mood and interest in activities since their divorce.\n- A pattern of anxiety and worry is evident, with the patient experiencing panic attacks and avoiding social situations.\n- The patient expresses feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness.\n- There's a notable presence of both physical and psychological symptoms, suggesting a complex clinical presentation.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and social avoidance.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Possible given the recent significant stressor (divorce) and symptoms of detachment and anxiety.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Multiple physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches) without a clear medical cause.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation (Q11):** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Social Isolation (Q20):** The patient is withdrawing from social interactions, which can exacerbate symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture suggestive of comorbid mental health conditions, primarily Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation, significant distress, and impairment in social and occupational functioning underscores the need for immediate and comprehensive clinical intervention. The patient's report of feeling overwhelmed, detached, and uncertain about their future highlights the importance of a supportive and non-judgmental therapeutic relationship. Further evaluation, including a detailed diagnostic interview and possibly additional assessments, is necessary to accurately diagnose and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic interview to confirm suspected diagnoses.\n- Assessment of suicide risk and development of a safety plan.\n- Consideration of both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.\n- Regular follow-up to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.",

It's clear that the recent changes in your life, particularly your divorce, have had a significant impact on your mental health. You're experiencing a range of symptoms that are affecting your daily life, from <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> to <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in <sym>sleep</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. Additionally, the presence of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>panic attacks</sym> supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The patient's recent experience of a significant life stressor (divorce) and their reports of <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further underscore the need for comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n2. Develop a <sym>suicide prevention plan</sym> and regularly assess <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n4. Encourage <sym>social support</sym> through group therapy or support groups to combat <sym>social isolation</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.",
