The patient's recent divorce may have triggered or exacerbated these symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation and emotional distress highlights the need for careful assessment and intervention. Further evaluation and potential referral to specialized services, such as therapy or medication management, may be warranted to address these concerns.

You described feeling like you're just going through the motions and expressed concerns about your future, job, and relationships. Your emotional pain and sense of hopelessness are palpable, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you without judgment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nYour symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), changes in sleep patterns (Q4, Q14), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2) are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>worry</sym> (Q6), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) suggest <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and emotional distress highlights the need for careful assessment and intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>MDD</med> and/or <med>GAD</med> and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <quote>patient-centered goals</quote> and targets symptom management, coping skills, and emotional regulation.\n3. Consideration of therapeutic approaches, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Evaluation of potential benefits and risks associated with <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to supplement therapy.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
