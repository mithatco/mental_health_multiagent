The patient reports avoiding social situations and feeling detached from others, suggesting possible social withdrawal.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance**\n\n1. Depressive disorder: The patient's endorsement of feeling down, irritated, and having unpleasant thoughts may indicate a depressive disorder.\n2. Anxiety disorder: The patient's reports of anxiety, panic, and avoidance behaviors suggest a possible anxiety disorder.\n3. Sleep disorder: The patient's sleep disturbances may be related to their depressive or anxiety symptoms.\n4. Cognitive impairment: The patient's cognitive difficulties may be related to their depressive or anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs**\n\n1.
