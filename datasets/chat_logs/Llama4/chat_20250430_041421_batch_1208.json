          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Primary concerns include:\n\n- Depressed mood and hopelessness (Q2)\n- Loss of interest and pleasure in activities (Q1)\n- Increased irritability and anger (Q3)\n- Anxiety and worry (Q6)\n- Panic attacks (Q7)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Physical symptoms associated with anxiety (Q9)\n- Cognitive difficulties, such as problems with memory and concentration (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (Q16, Q17)\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Depression:** The patient consistently reports symptoms of both anxiety (e.g., feeling on edge, panic attacks, worry) and depression (e.g., feeling down, hopeless, lack of interest in activities).\n- **Avoidance Behavior:** The patient avoids situations that make them anxious (Q8), which suggests that anxiety is significantly impacting daily functioning.\n- **Physical Symptoms:** The patient experiences a range of physical symptoms (e.g., aches and pains, digestive issues) that are likely related to anxiety.\n- **Self-Reported Functional Impairment:** The patient feels overwhelmed, stuck, and reports difficulties in daily functioning, relationships, and decision-making.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness are indicative of potential MDD.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors are suggestive of an anxiety disorder, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking locks) may indicate OCD.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, feelings of detachment and being on edge could suggest PTSD, but further assessment is needed.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient denies thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), but the presence of significant depressive symptoms and hopelessness warrants continued monitoring.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient reports past use of substances (alcohol, marijuana) as a form of self-medication, which could be a risk factor for substance use disorder.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by co-occurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Key observations include:\n\n* Significant depressive symptoms, including depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness. \n* Prominent anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors. \n* Physical symptoms and cognitive difficulties likely related to anxiety and depression. \n* Potential indicators of OCD and possible PTSD, requiring further evaluation. \n* Past self-medication with substances, suggesting a need to monitor for substance use. \n\nThese findings highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to identify specific mental health conditions and inform an effective treatment plan. \n\nRecommendations include \n* A detailed diagnostic interview \n* Consideration of additional assessments (e.g., PTSD screen) \n* Development of a treatment plan addressing depression, anxiety, and potential co-occurring disorders.",

Your reports of <sym>irritability, anxiety, and physical symptoms</sym> like aches and pains, digestive issues, and sleep disturbances paint a picture of significant distress. It's clear that these symptoms are affecting not just you, but also your relationships and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with both <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>persistent worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors</sym> are indicative of an anxiety disorder, potentially <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> or <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep, and feelings of hopelessness</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors</sym> may suggest <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med>, but further evaluation is needed.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Consider additional assessments, such as a <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> screen, given the patient's reports of feeling \"on edge\" and detached.\n3. Develop a treatment plan that addresses both depression and anxiety, potentially including <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications), and <med>lifestyle modifications</med> (e.g., exercise, mindfulness practices).\n4. Monitor for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and assess the patient's risk level, providing immediate support and resources if needed.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <med>symptom journal</med> to track their symptoms and identify patterns, which can inform treatment decisions.",
