This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressed mood (Q2: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless)\n* Anxious distress (Q6: feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge)\n* Loss of interest or pleasure in activities (Q1: little interest or pleasure in doing things)\n* Irritability (Q3: feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual)\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4: sleeping less than usual, but still have a lot of energy; Q14: problems with sleep that affected sleep quality overall)\n* Physical symptoms (Q9: unexplained aches and pains)\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports a pervasive pattern of anxious distress, including symptoms of anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n* Depressive symptoms are also prominent, including depressed mood (Q2), loss of interest or pleasure (Q1), and feelings of hopelessness.\n* The patient experiences significant sleep disturbances, which may be related to their anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): The patient's symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, and changes in sleep and appetite may meet criteria for MDD.\n* Anxiety Disorder: The patient's symptoms of anxious distress, panic attacks, and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations may meet criteria for an anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Social Anxiety Disorder.\n* Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Although not directly assessed, the patient's symptoms of anxious distress, avoidance, and physical symptoms may suggest a possible trauma history.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation: Although the patient denies thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), their depressive symptoms and feelings of hopelessness may indicate a risk for suicidal ideation or behavior.\n* Substance use: The patient reports trying to self-medicate with alcohol or marijuana in the past, which may indicate a risk for substance use disorder.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by co-occurring depressive and anxious symptoms, sleep disturbances, and physical symptoms. Their symptoms suggest potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and an Anxiety Disorder. The patient's history of self-medication and current substance use habits warrant further assessment. The clinician should consider a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough assessment of the patient's trauma history, suicidal ideation, and substance use habits. A treatment plan addressing the patient's depressive and anxious symptoms, sleep disturbances, and physical symptoms is warranted.",
