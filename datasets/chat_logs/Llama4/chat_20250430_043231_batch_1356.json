The co-occurrence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling <sym>nervous</sym> and <sym>on edge</sym> (Q6), and <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), suggests <med>anxious distress</med>.

Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3.
