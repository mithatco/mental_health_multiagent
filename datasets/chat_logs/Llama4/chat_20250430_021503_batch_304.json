They describe feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a reported increase in irritability and frustration. The patient also experiences anxiety, worry, and panic, which have led to avoidance of social situations.\n\n**Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n1. **Depressive symptoms:** The patient reports persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, and hopelessness (Q1, Q2, Q18), which are accompanied by a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1).\n2. **Anxiety symptoms:** The patient experiences anxiety, worry, and panic (Q6, Q7), which have led to avoidance behaviors (Q8).\n3. **Sleep disturbances:** The patient reports significant sleep disturbances, including early morning wakefulness and difficulty falling back asleep (Q4, Q14).\n4. **Cognitive difficulties:** The patient experiences difficulties with memory, concentration, and learning new information (Q15).\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** The patient's reported symptoms of persistent sadness, emptiness, and loss of interest in activities, along with changes in sleep and appetite, suggest potential diagnostic criteria for MDD.\n2. **Anxiety Disorders:** The patient's experiences of anxiety, worry, and panic, as well as avoidance behaviors, may indicate an anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).\n3. **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** The patient's reported sleep disturbances may meet diagnostic criteria for a sleep-wake disorder, such as Insomnia Disorder.\n\n**Risk Factors and Warning Signs:**\n\n1. **Suicidal ideation:** The patient reports occasional thoughts of not wanting to be here, but denies having a plan (Q11). This indicates a need for further assessment and monitoring of suicidal risk.\n2. **Emotional distress:** The patient's reported feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, and despair suggest significant emotional distress.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and sleep-related symptoms. The patient's reported symptoms and concerns suggest potential diagnostic considerations for Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Sleep-Wake Disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not plan-specific, warrants further assessment and monitoring. Overall, the patient's clinical presentation indicates a need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan to address their mental health concerns.",

You feel down, depressed, and hopeless, and it's like there's a weight on you all the time. You've also been experiencing anxiety, worry, and panic, which have led you to avoid social situations. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're waking up early, feeling tired and frustrated. It's clear that you're going through a tough time, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress and insomnia symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reported symptoms of persistent <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>emptiness</sym>, along with a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, align with diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>.
