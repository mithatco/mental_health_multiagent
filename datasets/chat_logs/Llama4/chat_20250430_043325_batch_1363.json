          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Depressed Mood and Anhedonia:** The patient reports feeling disconnected from activities they used to enjoy (Q1), and experiencing days of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2).\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient experiences panic attacks (Q7), feelings of nervousness, anxiety, and being on edge (Q6), and avoids situations that make them anxious (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** The patient has trouble sleeping due to being on edge and worried about panic attacks (Q4, Q14).\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, during panic attacks (Q9).\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves but denies intent (Q11).\n- **Feelings of Detachment:** During panic attacks, the patient feels detached from themselves and their surroundings (Q18).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic Attacks:** The patient's responses suggest a significant impact of panic attacks on their daily life, including avoidance behaviors (Q8), constant fear of having another attack (Q16), and physical symptoms during attacks (Q9).\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient reports decreased interest in activities (Q1), feelings of hopelessness (Q2), and social withdrawal (Q20).\n- **Sleep and Physical Health:** The patient experiences sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14) and somatic complaints, particularly during panic attacks.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurrent panic attacks, fear of having another attack, and significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder:** Depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the avoidance behaviors and hyperarousal symptoms could suggest PTSD if trauma exposure is present.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves, which indicates a risk factor for suicide.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to self-medicate, the desire to use something to calm down during attacks (Q23) could indicate a risk for future substance use.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, primarily driven by recurrent panic attacks and fear of future attacks. These symptoms have led to avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, and considerable distress. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent highlights the need for close monitoring and intervention. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and possibly PTSD, which require further evaluation. The patient's overall clinical presentation indicates a need for comprehensive treatment planning, including psychotherapy and possibly pharmacotherapy, to address symptoms and improve functioning. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Panic Disorder\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (if trauma exposure is present)\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview, including trauma assessment.\n- Consider administering standardized measures for panic disorder, depression, and anxiety.\n- Develop a treatment plan addressing immediate concerns, such as suicidal ideation, and long-term goals for managing anxiety and depressive symptoms.",

It's exhausting.</quote> Your experiences with panic attacks, feeling like you're going to die or lose control, and the physical symptoms that come with them are clearly very challenging. It's understandable that you've been avoiding certain situations and feeling lonely due to these experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, as evidenced by recurrent panic attacks (Q7), fear of having another attack (Q16), and significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning (Q8, Q20). The patient also reports <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> (Q1), and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> (Q20), which are characteristic of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without intent requires careful monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview, including a trauma assessment to rule out <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>.\n2. Administer standardized measures for <med>panic disorder</med>, <med>depression</med>, and <med>anxiety</med> to assess symptom severity.\n3. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address panic attacks, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Consider <med>pharmacotherapy</med> options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage symptoms of <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.\n5. Provide the patient with coping strategies and resources for managing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptom progression and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.",
