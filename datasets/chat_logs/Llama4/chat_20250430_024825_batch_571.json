Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health and how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We have 23 questions to go through, and we'll take it one at a time. Let's start with the first question. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their reports of negative affect, avoidance behaviors, and cognitive impairment suggest significant distress and impairment. The patient's symptoms may be related to a major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or adjustment disorder.
