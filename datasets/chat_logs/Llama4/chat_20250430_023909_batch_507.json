The symptoms described, such as little interest or pleasure in activities, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and anxiety, are more closely aligned with depressive disorders. The mention of impulse control issues and anxiety symptoms further supports a depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety rather than a bipolar disorder.",
