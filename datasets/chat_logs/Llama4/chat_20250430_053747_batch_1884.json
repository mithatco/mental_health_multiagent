Emotional regulation difficulties and physical symptoms, such as unexplained aches and pains, are also concerns. While the patient denied suicidal ideation and substance use, further exploration of these areas may be necessary to ensure comprehensive understanding of their mental health status. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should be developed to address these concerns.",
