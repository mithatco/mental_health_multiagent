For example, the therapist asked about 'feeling down' instead of specifically asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' and 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' as stated in the DSM-5 measure. However, the questions were mostly clinically relevant and targeted the correct symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question following from previous responses. However, there were minor logical inconsistencies, such as abrupt transitions between topics. The therapist mostly maintained a coherent conversational arc but could have improved by smoother transitions and more follow-up questions on critical disclosures.",

The therapist effectively linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to the diagnostic criteria for both conditions, demonstrating a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed empathy and a natural conversational style, with mostly appropriate professional tone. However, there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. The therapist could have shown more emotional acknowledgment and personalized the interactions further to achieve a perfect score."
