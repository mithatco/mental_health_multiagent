This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a lot of distressing emotions and thoughts, feeling overwhelmed by <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> that seems to permeate every aspect of your life. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, with <quote>\"less interest in things lately\"</quote> and a persistent sense of <quote>\"sadness following me around\"</quote>. Your <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> are affecting your relationships, and you're avoiding situations that make you anxious. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and that they're impacting your daily functioning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, possibly <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> (GAD), given the pervasive nature of your worry and anxiety across multiple domains. Additionally, your reports of <sym>decreased interest</sym>, <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>frustration</sym> with yourself suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD). The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further supports these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview with a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. Development of a personalized treatment plan, which may include <med>medication</med> (e.g., antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications) and <med>psychotherapy</med>.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <sym>self-care activities</sym>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
