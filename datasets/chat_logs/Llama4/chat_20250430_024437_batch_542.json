The questions were directly related to the patient's symptoms and experiences.",

The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal symptoms, depressed mood, anhedonia, and feelings of hopelessness. The differential diagnosis was considered, and the therapist provided a clear rationale for the chosen diagnoses.",
