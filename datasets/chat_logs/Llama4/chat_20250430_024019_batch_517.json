This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Social anxiety and discomfort in large gatherings or events\n- Feelings of downness, particularly after social interactions that didn't go well\n- Irritability, especially in anxiety-provoking situations\n- Anxiety and worry about being judged or saying something wrong in social situations\n- Avoidance of social situations due to anxiety\n- Recurring, intrusive thoughts about social interactions and fear of judgment\n- Occasional physical symptoms (headaches, stomach issues) related to stress about social situations\n- Feelings of detachment, particularly in social situations\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- A significant pattern of social anxiety symptoms, including fear of negative evaluation, avoidance of social situations, and anxiety in interactions with others.\n- The patient experiences both psychological (e.g., worry, anxiety) and physical (e.g., headaches, stomach issues) symptoms related to social stressors.\n- There is a reported difficulty in forming and maintaining close relationships due to social anxiety.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms of intense fear or anxiety in social situations, avoidance of social interactions, and fear of being negatively evaluated.\n- **Depressive Disorders:** Although the patient denies feeling depressed, episodic feelings of downness, especially after social interactions, suggest potential for a depressive disorder or adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety symptoms, panic-like symptoms in anticipation of or during social events, and significant distress in social situations.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- Suicidal ideation: Not endorsed.\n- Substance use: Minimal and within normative limits.\n- Psychotic symptoms: Not endorsed.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms indicative of social anxiety disorder, including marked fear or anxiety in social situations, avoidance of social interactions due to fear of negative evaluation, and substantial distress or impairment in social and occupational settings. Additionally, there are indications of possible depressive symptoms, particularly in reaction to social stressors. The presence of recurring, intrusive thoughts and physical symptoms associated with social anxiety further supports the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. The clinical picture suggests potential for co-occurring anxiety and depressive disorders. A thorough diagnostic interview and possible additional assessments are warranted to accurately identify the patient's clinical needs and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of discomfort in social situations, feeling like you're constantly on edge and worried about being judged or saying something wrong. You mentioned enjoying hobbies and spending time with people you trust, but big gatherings or events make you really uncomfortable. You also shared that you sometimes feel down, especially after social interactions that didn't go well, and that you get headaches or stomach issues when you're stressed about social situations. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, characterized by a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. The patient's <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym> and <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym> due to this fear are key diagnostic criteria. Additionally, the patient's experience of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about social interactions and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomach issues in anticipation of or during social events further support this diagnosis. While there are also indications of possible <med>depressive symptoms</med>, particularly in reaction to social stressors, the predominant clinical picture suggests <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> as the primary diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Exposure therapy to gradually help the patient become comfortable in social situations that currently cause anxiety.\n3. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> in social situations.\n4. Consideration of <med>antidepressant medication</med> if depressive symptoms persist or worsen.\n5. A follow-up appointment to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.",
