Your days are filled with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, making everyday tasks feel overwhelming. You mentioned feeling like you're walking on eggshells, constantly worried about when the next <sym>panic attack</sym> will strike, which has led to avoiding certain situations and withdrawing from loved ones. It's clear that these experiences are profoundly affecting your life, and it's heartbreaking to hear about the <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> you've been experiencing. Your feelings are valid, and it's crucial to address these challenges with compassionate care.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, as evidenced by <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>social withdrawal</sym> (Q20). The presence of recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) supports the diagnosis of an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms, along with <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11), necessitates immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>pharmacotherapy</med>, such as antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n3. Implement <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms.\n4. Provide <med>crisis intervention</med> and <med>suicidal risk assessment</med> given the patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5. Encourage <med>stress management techniques</med> such as mindfulness, meditation, or yoga to help cope with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the plan as necessary.",
