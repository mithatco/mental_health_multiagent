          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and potential suicidal ideation. Key concerns include:\n\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in activities\n- Anxiety and hypervigilance\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Cognitive impairments (concentration, memory)\n- Feelings of detachment and identity issues\n\n### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms**: The patient consistently reports feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, Q2).\n- **Anxiety**: Anxiety and irritability are prevalent, with the patient experiencing panic attacks and avoiding social situations due to anxiety (Q6, Q7, Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: The patient experiences excessive sleep as an escape and reports poor overall sleep quality (Q4, Q14).\n- **Cognitive and Emotional Disturbances**: The patient reports cognitive impairments, feelings of detachment, and a sense of unreality (Q15, Q18).\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient admits to thoughts of hurting themselves but denies intent (Q11).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Symptoms align with criteria for MDD, including depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation.\n- **Anxiety Disorders**: The patient's reports of anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest an anxiety disorder, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Social Anxiety Disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Although not directly indicated, symptoms of hypervigilance and detachment could suggest PTSD, warranting further exploration.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use**: While the patient denies excessive alcohol or drug use, the absence of coping mechanisms could exacerbate symptoms.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile indicative of significant mental health challenges, primarily depression and anxiety. Depressive symptoms include persistent sadness, anhedonia, changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, and suicidal ideation without intent. Anxiety symptoms manifest as excessive worry, panic attacks, and social avoidance. Cognitive impairments and feelings of detachment further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not acted upon, necessitates immediate attention and safety planning. Comprehensive assessment and intervention are warranted to address these multifaceted symptoms and concerns.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n- Social Anxiety Disorder\n- Potential PTSD (requires further evaluation)\n\n**Immediate Steps:**\n\n- Assess for suicidal intent and develop a safety plan.\n- Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm specific disorders.\n- Consider initiating therapy (e.g., CBT, medication) to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\n- Further diagnostic evaluation, including potential PTSD screening.\n- Development of a tailored treatment plan addressing depression, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms.\n- Regular monitoring of suicidal ideation and overall mental health status.\n\nThis summary provides a clinical overview based on the patient's self-reported symptoms and highlights the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and intervention plan.",
