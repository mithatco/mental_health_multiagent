For example, when the patient reported suicidal ideation, the therapist acknowledged the concern and ensured a safe space for discussion. The only area for improvement could be in probing slightly deeper into certain domains, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria, clearly targeting clinical symptoms. The language used was accurate and aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist directly referenced a DSM-5 symptom criterion. Questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way, showing a strong understanding of the DSM-5 framework.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics. For example, after the patient discussed anxiety symptoms, the therapist logically segued into questions about panic attacks and avoidance behaviors. The conversation had no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as feelings of hopelessness and sleep disturbances, to justify the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxiety Disorder symptoms and Substance Use Disorder concerns. The differential diagnosis was comprehensively considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For instance, when the patient admitted to suicidal ideation, the therapist provided a supportive and non-judgmental response, creating a safe space for further discussion."
