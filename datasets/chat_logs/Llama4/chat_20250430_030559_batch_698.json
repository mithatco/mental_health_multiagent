The patient's recent divorce may have triggered or contributed to these symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not actively endorsed, requires careful assessment and management.

Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise.",

However, there were a few instances where the therapist could have explored symptoms more deeply.

The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, decreased interest in activities, excessive worry, and panic attacks. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing potential differential diagnoses.",

You also shared that you're experiencing a lot of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>, and you're having trouble sleeping.

Additionally, the patient's experiences of <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest <med>GAD</med>. The patient's recent divorce may have triggered or contributed to these symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess and monitor symptoms.\n2. Consider referral to a therapist for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Develop a treatment plan focusing on symptom management, coping skills development, and exploration of the patient's recent divorce and its impact on their mental health.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track their symptoms and identify patterns.\n5. Consider medication options, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, in conjunction with therapy.",
