You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, like a cloud is following you everywhere. It's clear that you're experiencing significant distress and impairment in your daily life, affecting your relationships, sleep, and overall well-being. Your reports of feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and detached from yourself and others are particularly concerning. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.

Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: Schedule a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2.
