However, some questions were phrased vaguely or not fully explored, such as questions 10, 15, and 19. For instance, when asking about 'problems with memory,' the therapist didn't provide enough context or follow-up questions to fully understand the patient's experience. Similarly, questions about 'personality functioning' and 'repetitive thoughts/behaviors' were not thoroughly explored. Despite these minor omissions, the therapist covered a wide range of symptoms and concerns.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but some phrasing was slightly inaccurate or vague. For example, when asking about 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist immediately shifted to ensuring patient safety without fully exploring the thought patterns. Additionally, some questions seemed to conflate multiple symptoms (e.g., 'sleep problems' and 'energy/activity'). Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise and comprehensive.",
        "consistency": "The conversation mostly flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few abrupt transitions, such as moving from 'dissociative symptoms' to 'suicidal ideation' without fully exploring the implications of dissociative experiences. The therapist generally maintained a coherent conversational arc but could have provided smoother transitions and more follow-up questions to clarify patient responses.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist's diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious features and dissociative symptoms generally aligned with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked depressive symptoms, anxiety, and dissociative experiences to the diagnosis. However, the justification could have been stronger by discussing rule-outs (e.g., Anxiety Disorder, PTSD) and providing more detailed symptom-to-criteria mappings. The reasoning was sound but not exceptionally detailed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist consistently demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style. Responses were personalized, acknowledging the patient's emotional burden and distress. The therapist effectively balanced clinical inquiry with emotional support, particularly when discussing sensitive topics like suicidal ideation and dissociative symptoms. The tone was professional, warm, and non-judgmental throughout the conversation."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a strong clinical assessment approach, effectively covering a wide range of DSM-5 dimensions and showing empathy throughout. However, minor issues in question phrasing, logical flow, and diagnostic justification prevent a perfect score. Overall, the conversation was well-structured, and the therapist provided immediate support and safety planning for the patient's suicidal ideation. With some refinement in question precision and follow-up, the therapist could achieve exceptional performance across all criteria.",

You mentioned experiencing <sym>unpleasant thoughts</sym> and <sym>sleep problems</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. You also shared that sometimes you feel like you're watching yourself from outside your body or like you're in a dream, which can be a really weird and unsettling experience. <quote>Well... sometimes I think about not being here anymore. It's not like I have a plan or anything</quote> - it's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious features and <med>dissociative symptoms</med>.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (feeling down, sleeping less than usual), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (feeling nervous, panic or being frightened), and <sym>dissociative symptoms</sym> (feeling detached or distant from yourself). The patient's <quote>suicidal ideation</quote> without a plan requires immediate attention and assessment. While the symptoms could suggest other diagnoses, such as <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> or <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, the prominent depressive symptoms and dissociative experiences lean towards a diagnosis of <med>MDD</med> with anxious features and dissociative symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.
