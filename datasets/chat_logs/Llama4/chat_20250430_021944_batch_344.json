You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that everyday activities feel like a chore. It's clear that you're experiencing a significant amount of distress, including feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and anxiety. You're also struggling with sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and feelings of disconnection from yourself and others. <quote>\"It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting as it used to.
