Depressive symptoms include persistent sadness, anhedonia, changes in sleep and energy, and feelings of hopelessness. Anxiety symptoms comprise excessive worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors. Cognitive and physical symptoms further complicate the clinical presentation. The patient's recent divorce may be a significant stressor contributing to these symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation, albeit vague, necessitates careful assessment and intervention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of a treatment plan addressing these multifaceted needs are warranted.",
