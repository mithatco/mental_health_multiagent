However, the therapist's questions were mostly clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",

However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly transitioned between topics, such as moving from discussing anxiety to asking about substance use. Overall, the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",

However, the therapist could have more explicitly linked the diagnosis to DSM-5 criteria and considered alternative diagnoses. The reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was mostly sound but could have been more detailed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but occasionally came across as slightly impersonal or abrupt. For example, when the patient disclosed having thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist responded matter-of-factly without fully acknowledging the patient's distress.
