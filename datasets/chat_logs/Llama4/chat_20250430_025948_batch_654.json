Consider referring the patient to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, for further evaluation and treatment.\n4.

The patient's experiences of panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and cognitive distortions suggest a potential diagnosis of anxiety and/or depressive disorders. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not imminent, warrants careful monitoring and assessment. Further evaluation and diagnostic clarification are necessary to develop an effective treatment plan. \n\n DSM-5 diagnoses to consider: \n- Panic Disorder (300.21)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02)\n- Major Depressive Disorder (296.32) \n- Possible trauma-related disorders (e.g., PTSD) \n\n A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough clinical interview and potential additional assessments (e.g., trauma-focused measures), is necessary to confirm these impressions and guide treatment planning.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a lot of distress and discomfort lately. You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and that <sym>panic attacks</sym> have made you question everything. You feel like you're just going through the motions, and it's like you're outside your body watching everything happen. You also shared that you've been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and that <sym>anxiety</sym> has become a constant companion. It's clear that you're struggling to cope with these feelings and that they're impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with a diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med>, characterized by recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are not situationally bound, and persistent concern or worry about having panic attacks or their consequences. The patient's experiences of <sym>intense fear</sym>, <sym>hyperalertness</sym>, and physical symptoms such as <sym>chest pain</sym> and <sym>shortness of breath</sym> during panic attacks, along with <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> and <sym>social withdrawal</sym>, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's reported <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> may suggest a co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, which would require further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med> and assess for co-occurring conditions, such as <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <sym>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</sym> and/or <sym>medication</sym> to manage panic symptoms and address depressive symptoms.\n3. Consider referring the patient to a specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, for further evaluation and treatment.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their panic attacks and identify potential triggers.\n5. Discuss <sym>stress management</sym> techniques, such as <sym>deep breathing</sym>, <sym>progressive muscle relaxation</sym>, and <sym>mindfulness</sym>, to help the patient cope with anxiety.",
