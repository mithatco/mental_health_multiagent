This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressed mood (Q2: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless)\n* Anxious distress (Q6: feeling nervous, anxious, frightened, worried, or on edge)\n* Irritability (Q3: feeling more irritated, grouchy, or angry than usual)\n* Sleep disturbances (Q4: trouble sleeping, Q14: problems with sleep quality)\n* Loss of interest or pleasure (Q1: little interest or pleasure in doing things)\n* Physical symptoms (Q9: unexplained aches and pains)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports a pervasive pattern of anxious distress, with symptoms of worry, fear, and panic (Q6, Q7, Q9).\n* Depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure are also prominent (Q2, Q1).\n* The patient experiences significant sleep disturbances, which may be related to anxiety and stress (Q4, Q14).\n* Cognitive difficulties, such as trouble concentrating and memory problems, are reported (Q15).\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): Depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, and sleep disturbances.\n* Anxiety Disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, or Social Anxiety Disorder, given the patient's reports of anxious distress, panic attacks, and avoidance of social situations.\n* Sleep-Wake Disorders: Insomnia Disorder or other sleep disturbances.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation: Not reported (Q11), but the patient's feelings of hopelessness and despair (Q2) warrant close monitoring.\n* Substance use: The patient reports using marijuana to relax, but notes it worsens anxiety; no other substance use reported.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. The patient's reports of anxious distress, panic attacks, and avoidance of social situations suggest potential anxiety disorders. Depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, and cognitive difficulties also indicate possible Major Depressive Disorder. The patient's sleep disturbances and physical symptoms may be related to anxiety and stress. Overall, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying conditions and develop an effective treatment plan.",
