This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Mostly, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",

For instance, after the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have immediately followed up with a more in-depth inquiry or a safety plan discussion. Overall, the conversation was coherent with minor areas for improvement.",

The reasoning behind the diagnosis was explicitly stated and directly linked to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep patterns, and feelings of hopelessness. The justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style. Responses were personalized and acknowledged the patient's distress. The therapist created a safe space for the patient to share their experiences and validated their emotions. The tone was professional and supportive throughout the conversation."
