You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that it's hard to connect with others. <quote>It's like there's a cloud over me, and it's hard to shake it off</quote>. I can sense the frustration and hopelessness that comes with feeling like you're stuck in a rut. Your experiences of <sym>panic-like feelings</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like blushing and sweating are really distressing. I'm here to support you and help you explore ways to manage these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and behaviors align with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, characterized by <sym>excessive fear or anxiety</sym> in social situations, <sym>avoidance of social interactions</sym>, and <sym>significant distress or impairment</sym> in daily life. Additionally, the patient's reports of feeling <quote>down, depressed, and hopeless</quote> and lacking interest in activities suggest a <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's experiences of <sym>rumination</sym> and <sym>negative thinking</sym> may be contributing to their overall distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>maladaptive behaviors</sym> contributing to social anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable with social situations and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4.
