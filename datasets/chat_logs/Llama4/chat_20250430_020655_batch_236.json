The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. There were no instances of vague or imprecise language that could have altered the clinical meaning of the questions.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, and there were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. The therapist also appropriately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation, demonstrating a smooth and logical progression of the conversation.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) clearly aligned with the patient's responses, and the reasoning behind this decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist directly linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, providing a comprehensive justification for the diagnosis. Alternative diagnoses, such as anxiety disorders, were also considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style, maintaining an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. The interaction was warm and personalized, with no instances of clinical detachment or overly technical language."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation between the therapist and the patient was exceptional in its coverage of DSM-5 dimensions, clinical relevance, consistency, diagnostic justification, and empathy. The therapist demonstrated a deep understanding of the patient's symptoms and effectively used the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to guide the assessment. The conversation was logically structured, empathetic, and professionally conducted, making it a model for best practices in clinical assessment.",
