You're also feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a cloud of negativity following you everywhere. These feelings are affecting your sleep, causing you to sleep a lot but still feel tired. You're experiencing aches and pains, and feeling frustrated, anxious, and worried about the future. It's like you're stuck and don't know how to get out of this rut. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of depressive symptoms, including <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15), and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> (Q9). These symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> as outlined in the DSM-5. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) without a plan also warrants careful assessment and monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>pharmacological interventions</med> (e.g., antidepressants) to address depressive symptoms.\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> (e.g., mindfulness, deep breathing) to help manage sleep disturbances.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Consideration of <med>referral to a specialist</med> (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist) for further evaluation and treatment if necessary.",
