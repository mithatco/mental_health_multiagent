You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, like hiking, due to <quote>\"the anxiety getting in the way.\"</quote> Your days are filled with a constant sense of hypervigilance, always bracing for the next <sym>panic attack</sym>. This cycle of anxiety and fear has taken a toll on your relationships and overall well-being. It's clear that you're finding it difficult to cope with these feelings, and there are moments when you feel like you're losing yourself to these emotions.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Panic Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, as evidenced by recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>fear of having another attack</sym>, and <sym>hypervigilance</sym>. The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling down and hopeless, particularly after panic attacks, suggests co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Although the symptoms are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation, the clinical impression leans towards these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation**: A thorough assessment, including a physical exam and psychological questionnaires, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: A therapeutic approach that can help you manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication**: Consideration of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to help manage symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to help reduce <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. **Safety Planning**: Development of a plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including emergency contact numbers and a crisis hotline.",
