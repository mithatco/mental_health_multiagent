The patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms suggest a co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's substance use (marijuana) may be related to or exacerbating symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Schizophrenia</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consideration of medication options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics, to help manage symptoms.\n4. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help the patient cope with symptoms and improve daily functioning.\n5. Substance use counseling to address the patient's marijuana use and potential for self-medication.\n6.
