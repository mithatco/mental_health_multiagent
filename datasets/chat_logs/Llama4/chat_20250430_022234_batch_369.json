We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's responses suggest a potential diagnosis of MDD, an anxiety disorder (possibly PTSD), and substance use as a coping mechanism. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as a coping mechanism highlights the need for careful assessment and intervention.
