The patient's reports of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by a plan or intent, warrant careful attention and assessment. The patient's avoidance behaviors and somatic symptoms may be indicative of underlying emotional distress. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Anxiety Disorders (e.g., GAD, SAD)\n* Sleep-Wake Disorders (e.g., Insomnia Disorder)\n* Other mental health conditions (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Further evaluation and assessment to determine the underlying causes of the patient's symptoms\n* Development of a treatment plan addressing the patient's depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment\n* Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and risk factors\n* Consideration of additional assessments or evaluations (e.g., psychological testing, medical evaluation) as necessary.",
