The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

For example, when the patient mentioned thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist addressed this concern directly and provided a supportive response.",

The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive justification for the diagnosis. Additionally, the therapist considered alternative diagnoses, such as Anxiety Disorder, and noted the need for further evaluation to rule out trauma-related symptoms.",

The therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, acknowledging their distress and providing a supportive environment.
