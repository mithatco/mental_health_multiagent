Their anxiety and avoidance behaviors may contribute to feelings of isolation and decreased pleasure in activities. Sleep disturbances and rumination are also notable concerns. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these impressions and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Anxiety Disorder, Unspecified\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Continued assessment to confirm diagnosis and identify any co-occurring conditions\n* Development of a treatment plan addressing social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances\n* Consideration of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacological interventions to manage symptoms.",

However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately reflected the DSM-5 criteria.",
