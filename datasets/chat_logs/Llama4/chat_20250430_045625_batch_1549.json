They mention feeling like they're \"stuck in a rut\" and struggling with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>. The patient also reports <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, although they deny intent to act on these thoughts. They express frustration with their symptoms and difficulty finding enjoyment in activities they once loved, like playing guitar. Overall, the patient appears to be struggling with a complex set of emotional and psychological challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate Severity</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. They report experiencing <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <sym>lack of interest in activities</sym>, <sym>feeling down</sym>), as well as <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym>. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and difficulties with sleep also support this diagnosis. While the patient reports some <sym>manic symptoms</sym> (e.g., increased energy, <sym>starting lots of projects</sym>), these do not appear to be severe or persistent enough to warrant a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med> at this time.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to further assess symptoms and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, potentially including medication and therapy.\n3. Consider referring the patient to a therapist to address <sym>mood symptoms</sym> and develop coping strategies.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a symptom journal to track their <sym>mood</sym> and <sym>sleep patterns</sym>.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
