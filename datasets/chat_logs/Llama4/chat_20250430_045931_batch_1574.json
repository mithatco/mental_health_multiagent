      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a persistent sense of sadness and disconnection from things that used to bring you joy. You described feeling like you're walking around with a cloud of sadness following you, and it's hard to shake it off. You also experience intense fear and panic, which feels like it's taking over your life. <quote>\"It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, or for a panic attack to happen. It's exhausting.\"</quote> You're avoiding certain situations and places because you're scared of having a panic attack, and this is affecting your relationships with friends and family. You're also experiencing physical symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath during these attacks. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I understand how overwhelming this must feel.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med>, as evidenced by recurrent panic attacks (Q7), fear of having future attacks (Q6), and avoidance behaviors (Q8). Additionally, your reported <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>lack of interest or pleasure</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms suggests a need for a comprehensive treatment plan addressing both anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on panic management and exposure therapy to address avoidance behaviors.\n2. Pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to manage symptoms of both depression and anxiety.\n3. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n4. Consider mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage anxiety and improve sleep quality.\n5. Family therapy to address relationship dynamics and provide education on supporting a loved one with anxiety and depression.",
