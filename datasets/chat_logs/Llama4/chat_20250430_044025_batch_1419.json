        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Each dimension was thoroughly explored, and the patient provided detailed responses. The therapist ensured that no domain was skipped or superficially covered, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about 'suicidal ideation,' the therapist could have used more direct language. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question naturally following from the patient's previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent and engaging dialogue, effectively exploring symptoms and concerns without abrupt topic changes.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear and well-justified diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxiety and Psychotic Symptoms. The reasoning directly cited specific patient symptoms and aligned with DSM-5 criteria. The therapist also outlined comprehensive treatment options and considerations.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally demonstrated empathy and a professional tone, but there were moments where responses seemed slightly formulaic or lacking in emotional warmth. For example, when discussing 'suicidal ideation,' a more empathetic acknowledgment of the patient's distress could have been provided."
