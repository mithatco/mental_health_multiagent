Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and hopelessness (Q2)\n- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities (Q1)\n- Irritability (Q3)\n- Anxiety and fear (Q6, Q7)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Physical symptoms (e.g., aches, pains, pounding heart, sweating, trembling) (Q9)\n- Panic attacks (Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n- Cognitive difficulties (e.g., trouble focusing, memory issues) (Q15)\n- Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment (Q18)\n- Social withdrawal (Q20)\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient frequently endorses symptoms related to anxiety and panic, indicating a significant impact on daily life.\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, along with a decrease in interest or pleasure in activities.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient experiences significant sleep problems, likely exacerbated by anxiety.\n- **Avoidance:** Avoids situations due to fear of panic attacks, leading to social withdrawal.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Endorsement of depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurring panic attacks, excessive worry, fear, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly assessed, the presence of intrusive thoughts and feelings of detachment could suggest trauma-related symptoms.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Persistent worry and anxiety about various things.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** Denies using substances, which could be a protective factor but also might indicate a need for closer monitoring.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by prominent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic. The presence of suicidal ideation, significant distress, and impairment in social and occupational functioning highlights the need for immediate and comprehensive intervention. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, and possibly PTSD, which require further evaluation. The patient's report of panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, and avoidance behaviors indicates a high level of distress. The identified risk factors, particularly suicidal ideation, necessitate a careful and multi-faceted treatment approach.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm specific psychiatric diagnoses.\n- Development of a treatment plan that addresses depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and suicidal ideation.\n- Consideration of both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication for symptom management.\n- Regular monitoring of suicidal ideation and overall mental health status.",

It's clear that <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> are significantly impacting your daily life. Your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest that you're struggling with managing your emotions and engaging in activities that you used to enjoy. I want you to know that it takes a lot of courage to share these experiences, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>, given the presence of <sym>recurring panic attacks</sym>, <sym>excessive worry</sym>, and <sym>fear</sym>.

In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm specific psychiatric diagnoses, including the possibility of <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> given the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, potentially including pharmacological interventions and psychotherapy such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med>.\n3. Regular monitoring of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and overall mental health status to ensure safety and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.\n4.
