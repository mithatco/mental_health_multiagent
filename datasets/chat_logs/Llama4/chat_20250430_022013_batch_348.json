Depressive symptoms: The patient reports feeling disconnected from activities they used to enjoy (Q1), feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (Q2), and having thoughts that it would be easier if they weren't here (Q11).\n2. Anxiety symptoms: The patient experiences irritability (Q3), anxiety (Q6), panic (Q7), and avoidance of situations that make them anxious (Q8).\n3. Sleep disturbances: The patient reports lying awake at night (Q14) and having trouble shutting off their mind.\n4.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): The patient's depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2, Q11) may indicate a potential diagnosis of MDD.\n2. Anxiety Disorders: The patient's anxiety symptoms (Q6, Q7, Q8) may indicate a potential diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder.\n3.
