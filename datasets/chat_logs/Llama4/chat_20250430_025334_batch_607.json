This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms suggest significant distress and impairment. Sleep disturbances and fatigue are also notable concerns. The presence of suicidal ideation without a plan requires immediate attention and safety planning. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these impressions and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n\n* In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm suspected diagnoses\n* Development of a safety plan to address suicidal ideation\n* Consideration of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacological interventions to address depressive and anxiety symptoms\n* Sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques to address sleep disturbances\n* Regular follow-up and monitoring to assess treatment response and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",

You mentioned feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and that the excitement or pleasure isn't there like it used to be. You also shared that you're constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop or for a panic attack to happen. It's clear that these experiences have been significantly impacting your daily life and relationships. <quote>\"I feel lost, like I used to know who I was and what I wanted, but now everything feels uncertain.\"</quote> Your concerns about not being taken seriously by medical professionals and feeling like you're losing control are also valid and important to address.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>, and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional).\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the presence of recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>excessive fear and worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>decreased interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>irritability</sym> suggest <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>fatigue</sym> may be related to both conditions. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan requires immediate attention and safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm suspected diagnoses and assess for other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n3. Consideration of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>pharmacological interventions</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. Sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up and monitoring to assess treatment response and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
