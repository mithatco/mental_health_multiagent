However, the therapist did adequately cover domains such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.",

For example, question 5 (Starting lots more projects than usual or doing more risky things than usual?) seemed somewhat relevant but not precisely worded. Additionally, some questions could have been more specific to the patient's experiences, but overall, the questions were clinically relevant.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where the conversation seemed to jump abruptly from one topic to another. For example, after discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist moved quickly to questions about sleep and memory without fully exploring the implications of the patient's previous disclosure.",
