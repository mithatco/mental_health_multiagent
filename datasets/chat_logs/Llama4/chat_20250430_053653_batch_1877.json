No DSM-5 dimensions were skipped or only superficially covered.",

However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately reflected DSM-5 terminology.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively built on the patient's disclosures to guide the conversation. For instance, after the patient discussed panic attacks, the therapist seamlessly transitioned into questions about anxiety and avoidance behaviors. There were no abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. For example, 'The patient's reported use of substances to cope with stress and anxiety, as well as their thoughts of actually hurting yourself, raise concerns about suicidal ideation and substance use.' The justification was comprehensive and clinically sound.",

The therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, acknowledging their distress and validating their experiences. For instance, 'I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'm committed to helping you navigate these challenges.' The interaction was warm, personalized, and supportive throughout."

The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling disconnected from previously enjoyed activities, <quote>\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote>, and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as panic attacks and avoidance behaviors, suggest co-occurring mental health conditions.

These symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, and <med>SUD</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnoses and identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and substance use.\n3. **Medication Management**: Exploration of medication options, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Substance Use Counseling**: Counseling to address <med>substance use</med> and develop coping strategies to manage stress and anxiety.\n5. **Safety Planning**: Development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.",
