      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of disconnection from things you used to enjoy, and a constant sadness that feels hard to shake off. You've been experiencing <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> a lot lately. It's like there's this underlying <sym>anxiety</sym> that something bad could happen, or that you're not doing things right. You've also been having trouble sleeping, waking up early, and feeling like you're just going through the motions of life without really living. These feelings are affecting your relationships and daily life, making it hard to connect with others or find the energy to do things.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and significant distress in social relationships further supports this diagnosis. While the patient reports <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, these appear to be secondary to the depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Initiation of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage depressive symptoms.\n3. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> to improve sleep quality, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding screens before bedtime.\n5. Encouragement to engage in activities that bring pleasure and help build social connections.\n6. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
