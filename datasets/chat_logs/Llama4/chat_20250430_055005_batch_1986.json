I'm going to be administering the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand what symptoms you might be experiencing across various areas of mental health. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking each one in turn. Your responses will help us identify areas that might need further exploration or support. I'm here to listen without judgment, and I want to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. Let's begin with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, and it's hard to explain. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>low interest/pleasure</sym> and <sym>persistent sadness</sym>. You also shared that you're experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> at times, which can be really overwhelming. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you work through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxiety</med> features\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>decreased interest/pleasure</sym> (Q1), <sym>persistent sadness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>changes in sleep</sym> (Q4) are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Additionally, your reported <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>worry</sym> (Q6), and <sym>panic</sym> (Q7) suggest <med>anxiety</med> features. The co-occurrence of these symptoms suggests a complex clinical profile that requires further evaluation and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to improve sleep quality.\n4. Develop a <med>safety plan</med> to address suicidal ideation and ensure patient safety.\n5. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, to help manage symptoms.",
