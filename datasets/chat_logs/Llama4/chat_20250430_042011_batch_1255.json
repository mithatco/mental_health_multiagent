We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

They report significant distress and impairment in daily life, including decreased motivation, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties. The patient's responses suggest a potential diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation and increased substance use are concerning and warrant further assessment and monitoring. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address the patient's symptoms and concerns.",
