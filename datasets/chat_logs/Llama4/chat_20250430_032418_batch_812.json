I'm going to use the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire to understand your symptoms better. This is a tool to help identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
