Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and irritability, which appear to be impacting daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. The patient's responses suggest a high level of distress, with pervasive worry and anxiety across multiple domains. Sleep disturbances, physical symptoms, and avoidance behaviors are also prominent. These symptoms may be indicative of co-occurring depressive and anxiety disorders. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the presence and severity of specific mental health conditions.
