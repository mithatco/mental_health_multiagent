This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

However, the questions were mostly precise and targeted clinical symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist smoothly transitioned between topics and adequately followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and hallucinations.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound, directly citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as hallucinations (Q12) and depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2).",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments that seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate support or acknowledgment of distress. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding."

The therapist successfully explored all relevant dimensions, showed a logical flow in questioning, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. While minor areas for improvement exist, such as enhancing clinical precision in some questions and displaying empathy consistently, the overall performance was strong.",
