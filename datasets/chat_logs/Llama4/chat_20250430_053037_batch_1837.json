        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure, which is commendable. However, some areas could have been explored in greater depth. For instance, when the patient mentioned 'I have thoughts that I don't want to be here' (suicidal ideation), the therapist could have followed up more extensively but did move on to other topics. Similarly, while the patient reported 'unpleasant thoughts' and 'doing things over and over,' these symptoms were noted but not probed deeply. Overall, coverage was good but not exhaustive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, and they attempted to use clinically accurate language. However, there were moments where questions seemed slightly vague or could have been more precise. For example, when asking about sleep quality, the therapist could have specified 'over the past two weeks' to align more closely with the DSM-5 measure's instructions. Still, questions were mostly relevant and targeted appropriate symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The conversation generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few abrupt transitions. For instance, after discussing 'unpleasant thoughts,' the therapist moved to 'feeling detached or distant from yourself' without fully exploring the former. While not severely disruptive, these transitions could have been smoother. The therapist mostly maintained a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The conversation did not provide clear diagnostic justification based on DSM-5 criteria. The therapist collected information across various domains but did not explicitly link the patient's responses to specific diagnoses or discuss how these symptoms might align with particular DSM-5 criteria. The lack of a clear diagnostic conclusion or rationale makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of any potential diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist showed some empathy and maintained a professional tone throughout the conversation. However, there were moments where responses seemed somewhat robotic or impersonal. For example, when the patient disclosed 'I have thoughts that I don't want to be here,' the therapist could have responded with more emotional acknowledgment. While not unempathetic, the interaction could have been more warm and personalized."
      },
      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a good effort in covering a wide range of DSM-5 dimensions and maintaining a professional demeanor. However, areas for improvement include deeper exploration of certain symptoms, more precise language in questioning, smoother logical transitions, explicit diagnostic justification, and increased empathy. Overall, this was a solid but not exceptional performance.",
