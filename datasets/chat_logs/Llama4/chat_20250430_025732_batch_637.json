This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and treatment. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The reasoning provided was clinically sound but had minor ambiguity.",
