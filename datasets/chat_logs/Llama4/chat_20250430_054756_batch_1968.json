I just feel empty, like I'm going through the motions.</quote> Your mood has been down, and you've been experiencing hopelessness about the future. <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym> are clearly affecting your daily life. You also mentioned <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which are impacting your overall well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to address these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's reported <quote>feelings of hopelessness</quote> and <quote>suicidal ideation</quote> (although not a plan to act on these thoughts) indicate a need for urgent attention and support. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> are met, and further evaluation is necessary to rule out other potential diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. In-depth diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. Consideration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage symptoms.\n4. <med>Psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med>, to address underlying issues and develop coping strategies.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
