This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of suicidal ideation and potential substance use issues are concerning and warrant further exploration. The patient's impulsive behaviors and irritability may also indicate difficulties with impulse control.
