        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was addressed, and the patient provided detailed responses. The therapist ensured that no dimension was skipped or superficially covered, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about psychotic symptoms, the therapist could have used more specific language to capture the patient's experiences accurately. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the patient's symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's reports of hearing voices and feelings of hopelessness. The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression throughout.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features clearly aligns with the patient's symptoms as described. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic decision to specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, and psychotic symptoms. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was sound and clinically justified.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses generally showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's distress."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, and the diagnostic justification was clear and clinically sound. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language in some questions and increased emotional support in certain moments, the overall performance was strong.",
