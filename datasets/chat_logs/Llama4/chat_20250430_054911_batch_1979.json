This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

However, there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise or aligned with specific DSM-5 terminology.

Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but had minor inaccuracies.",

The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to the DSM-5 criteria. However, there was minor ambiguity in justification regarding the risk for developing depressive disorders in the future, which could have been more thoroughly addressed.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy and a professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and tailored responses to their emotional state. For example, the therapist noted, 'I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.'

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and worrying about saying something wrong or being judged by others. It's clear that these experiences are causing you significant distress and impacting your daily life. <quote>I'd say I have interest in doing things, but sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the motions</quote>. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and responses indicate a pattern of social anxiety, including <sym>excessive fear or anxiety</sym> in social situations, <sym>fear of being judged or evaluated</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q6-8). The patient's experiences of <sym>rumination and self-criticism</sym> (Q16) and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as stomach discomfort or headaches (Q9) are also consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. While the patient does not report persistent <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, their experiences of disappointment and self-doubt may indicate a risk for developing <med>depressive disorders</med> in the future.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>maladaptive behaviors</sym> contributing to social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for symptom management, in conjunction with therapy.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
