This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Honestly, I do find myself getting caught up in worries and stress, and it's hard for me to enjoy things like I used to. It's not that I don't want to have fun or do things, but my mind is always elsewhere, thinking about what could go wrong or what I need to do. It's like I'm constantly on edge, even when I'm trying to relax or do things I normally enjoy."

It's hard to shake off the feeling that things are just going to get worse, and that I'm not doing enough or that I'm not good enough."

      "role": "patient",
      "content": "Definitely. I get irritable really easily, and it's like my fuse is short. Little things can set me off, and I find myself snapping at people or getting frustrated when I'm already feeling overwhelmed. It's not fair to the people around me, but it's hard to control when I'm feeling so anxious all the time."

      "content": "Actually, it's more like I'm having trouble sleeping because my mind is racing. I'll lie awake at night thinking about all the things that could go wrong or that I need to do tomorrow. As for energy, I feel like I'm running on empty most of the time. I'm tired, but when I do try to sleep, I'm wide awake. It's frustrating."

      "content": "Absolutely. I avoid a lot of social situations or places that might trigger my anxiety. I've even started to avoid certain activities I used to enjoy because they make me feel too anxious. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of fear and avoidance, and I don't know how to break free."
