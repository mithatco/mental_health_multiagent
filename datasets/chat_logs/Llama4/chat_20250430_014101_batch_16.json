Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might need further exploration and support. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and hopelessness (Q2)\n- Loss of interest and pleasure in activities (Q1)\n- Anxiety and fear of panic attacks (Q6, Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Difficulty concentrating and memory issues (Q15)\n- Repetitive thoughts and urges related to panic attacks (Q16)\n- Feelings of detachment and questioning of self-identity (Q18, Q19)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A predominant pattern of anxiety and fear related to panic attacks, influencing daily functioning and well-being.\n- Significant impact on social relationships and daily activities due to avoidance behaviors and anxiety.\n- Co-occurring symptoms of depression, including depressed mood, loss of interest, and feelings of hopelessness.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Recurring panic attacks, fear of having panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest a panic disorder or agoraphobia.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and sleep disturbances may indicate a depressive disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the fear and avoidance behaviors could suggest elements of PTSD if there are past traumatic experiences.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reported thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to self-medicate (Q21-23), the clinician should monitor for potential misuse as a coping mechanism.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture characterized by symptoms consistent with anxiety and depressive disorders. The predominant concern is the patient's experience of recurrent panic attacks and the resultant significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent or plan requires careful assessment and management. The clinical impression suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the most appropriate treatment plan, potentially involving therapy (e.g., CBT) and pharmacological interventions. Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and overall mental health status is warranted.",

You feel <quote>\"disconnected\"</quote> and <sym>hopeless</sym> at times, and it's affecting your relationships and daily activities. Your <sym>anxiety</sym> and fear of having another attack are constant companions, making it difficult to relax or sleep. You've also been feeling <sym>irritated</sym> and frustrated with yourself. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and it takes a lot of courage to share what you're going through.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (provisional)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>fear of having panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> also supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> reported by the patient necessitates immediate attention and careful management.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnoses and assess for any other potential mental health conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that includes <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>panic disorder</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Implement <med>stress management techniques</med>, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises, to help the patient cope with <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
