        "explanation": "The diagnosis explicitly mentions 'Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder' as the primary condition, which aligns with the expected profile of schizophrenia. The presence of hallucinations (hearing voices) and persecutory ideation (feeling like someone is watching) supports this diagnosis. However, I wouldn't give it a 5 because the diagnosis also mentions co-occurring Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, which might suggest a more complex clinical presentation.",
