Depressive disorder: The patient's endorsements of feeling down, irritated, and experiencing disrupted sleep may indicate a depressive disorder.\n2. Anxiety disorder: The patient's reports of anxiety, panic, and avoidance behaviors may suggest an anxiety disorder.\n3.

However, some questions were phrased vaguely or lacked follow-up, which could have provided more depth. For example, the therapist asked about 'feeling down' (Q2) and 'irritated' (Q3) but didn't probe further into the patient's experiences. Overall, the coverage was good, but some areas could have been explored more thoroughly.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but some phrasing was slightly inaccurate or vague. For instance, the therapist asked about 'sleeping less than usual' (Q4) but didn't specify the time frame. Additionally, some questions were asked in a straightforward manner without clinical context, which might have helped the patient understand the relevance. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant, but some refinement could improve accuracy.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were some abrupt transitions between topics, such as moving from 'suicidal ideation' (Q11) to 'sleep disturbances' (Q14) without much connection. Additionally, the therapist didn't always follow up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's admission of suicidal ideation. Overall, the conversation was coherent, but some inconsistencies existed.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety features, provisional, and cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as feeling down (Q2), irritated (Q3), and anxious (Q6). However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, including a discussion of alternative diagnoses and the specific DSM-5 criteria used to support the diagnosis. Overall, the justification was clear, but some details were lacking.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation, acknowledging the patient's struggles and validating their emotions. However, some responses seemed slightly formulaic or lacking in emotional depth, such as when discussing suicidal ideation (Q11). The therapist could have provided more emotional support and connection. Overall, the empathy was evident, but some areas could have been more personalized."

I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>Anxiety</med> features, provisional\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms, such as <sym>feeling down</sym> (Q2), <sym>irritated</sym> (Q3), <sym>sleeping less than usual</sym> (Q4), and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>.
