      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling to find meaning and connection in your life, often feeling like you're just going through the motions. You experience <sym>down days</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly in social situations, which can be really tough. You've also mentioned feeling disconnected from your hobbies and others, which is heartbreaking. It's clear that you're searching for a way to break free from these feelings and find a more fulfilling life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex interplay of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive</sym> feelings, which don't quite meet the full criteria for a more specific diagnosis like <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. Your <sym>social anxiety</sym> and tendency to avoid certain situations also point towards <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, but the overall clinical picture seems to fit best with <med>Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features</med>. This diagnosis acknowledges the significant distress and impairment you're experiencing in response to life stressors.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This type of therapy can help you address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and develop coping strategies for managing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive</sym> feelings.\n2. **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)**: This approach can help you cultivate greater <quote>self-awareness</quote> and learn to manage stress in a healthier way.\n3. **Social Skills Training**: This could help you build confidence in social situations and develop more effective communication skills.\n4. **Medication Evaluation**: Depending on the severity of your symptoms, medication might be considered to help alleviate <sym>depressive</sym> or <sym>anxious</sym> feelings.\n5. **Regular Follow-Up**: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor your progress, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
