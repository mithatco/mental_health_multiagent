      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a lot of pain and distress lately. You mentioned feeling empty and unfulfilled, like nothing brings you joy anymore <sym>anhedonia</sym>. You've also been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless <sym>depressed</sym>, with a weight on your shoulders that you can't shake off. It's like you're going through the motions, but everything feels harder and more overwhelming. You shared that you've been having trouble sleeping, with nightmares and a hard time falling back asleep <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. You're also experiencing a lot of anxiety, feeling on edge and frightened <sym>anxiety</sym>, and you've had panic attacks. You're avoiding things that remind you of a past accident, and you're struggling to connect with others.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with co-occurring <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>trauma-related</sym> symptoms. The presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> related to a past accident, along with <sym>negative alterations in mood and cognition</sym>, are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and changes in sleep and appetite are indicative of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <quote>\"feeling like it would be easier if I wasn't here anymore\"</quote> suggests a risk of suicidal ideation, which requires careful assessment and monitoring.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. Conduct a thorough <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med> assessment using standardized tools to confirm the diagnosis and track symptoms over time.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses both <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med> symptoms, potentially including <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, <med>trauma-focused CBT</med>, or <med>prolonged exposure therapy</med>.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRI</med>s, to help manage <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to track sleep patterns and identify potential triggers for <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
