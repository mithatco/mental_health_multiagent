This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Depressive disorders: The patient's reports of depressive symptoms (Q1, Q2, Q11) may indicate a depressive disorder, such as Major Depressive Disorder.\n2. Anxiety disorders: The patient's anxiety symptoms (Q6, Q7, Q8) may suggest an anxiety disorder, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder.\n3.
