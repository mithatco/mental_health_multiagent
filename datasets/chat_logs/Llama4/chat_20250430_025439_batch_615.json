          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Anxiety**: The patient experiences persistent worry, fear, and anxiety, often feeling \"on edge\" and having panic attacks.\n- **Depression**: Reports feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a lack of interest in activities they used to enjoy.\n- **Sleep Disturbances**: Difficulty sleeping due to a racing mind and physical tension.\n- **Irritability**: Increased irritability and anger.\n- **Intrusive Thoughts and Compulsions**: Experiences intrusive thoughts and feels driven to perform certain behaviors or mental acts repeatedly.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Anxiety and Worry**: A pervasive pattern of anxiety and worry about various aspects of life, leading to a state of constant alertness and tension.\n- **Avoidance Behavior**: Avoids situations that make them anxious, such as crowded places.\n- **Physical Symptoms**: Reports physical tension, aches, and pains, particularly in the shoulders and neck, and gastrointestinal issues.\n- **Cognitive Impairment**: Difficulty concentrating and memory issues due to preoccupation with worries.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder**: Symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder, given the frequent panic attacks and persistent worry.\n- **Depressive Disorder**: The patient's reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, along with a decreased interest in activities, may indicate a Depressive Disorder.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**: The presence of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking locks repeatedly) could suggest OCD.\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorder**: Difficulty sleeping and unrested sleep indicate a potential Sleep-Wake Disorder.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation**: Although not explicitly stated, the patient's wish for the anxiety to stop and feeling overwhelmed could imply a risk. However, they deny thoughts of hurting themselves.\n- **Substance Use**: The patient mentions self-medicating with alcohol or marijuana, which could be a risk factor for substance use disorder.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms indicative of anxiety and depressive disorders. The pervasive worry, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, and compulsive behaviors suggest potential diagnoses of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and possibly Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Depressive symptoms are also prominent, with reports of feeling down and a lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities. Sleep disturbances and physical tension further complicate the clinical picture. The patient's avoidance behaviors and cognitive impairments (e.g., difficulty concentrating) are likely consequences of these mental health challenges. The use of substances as a form of self-medication is a concern for potential substance use issues. Overall, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted to accurately assess and address these clinical concerns.",
