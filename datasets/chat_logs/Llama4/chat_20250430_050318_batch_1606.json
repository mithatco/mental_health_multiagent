This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I try to shake it off, but it's hard.</quote> You also mentioned feeling down and depressed, and that it's hard to enjoy things anymore. Your sleep is affected, and you're experiencing physical symptoms like tension and stomachaches. It's clear that you're finding it really tough to cope with all of this, and it's impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of persistent worry, feeling on edge, and panic moments (Q6, Q7) are characteristic of <sym>anxiety</sym> and suggest a diagnosis of <med>GAD</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as decreased interest in activities, feeling down, and irritability (Q1, Q2, Q3), may indicate a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's sleep disturbances (Q14) and somatic symptoms (Q9) also support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview and physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRI</med>s, to help manage symptoms of <med>GAD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n4. Development of a self-care plan, including stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises, to help improve sleep and reduce <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
