          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic. Key concerns include:\n\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient expresses a disconnection from previously enjoyed activities (Q1), persistent feelings of sadness (Q2), and a general sense of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient experiences frequent anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8).\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** The patient reports trouble sleeping due to a racing mind and not feeling rested (Q4 and Q14).\n- **Physical Symptoms:** The patient experiences unexplained aches and pains, specifically chest pain and shortness of breath during panic attacks (Q9).\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient admits to thoughts of hurting themselves, though without plans (Q11).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Emotional Distress:** The patient consistently reports heightened emotional distress, including irritability (Q3), anxiety (Q6), and feelings of sadness (Q2).\n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** The patient avoids situations that trigger anxiety, such as places where panic attacks have occurred (Q8).\n- **Cognitive Disturbances:** The patient experiences memory issues (Q15) and unpleasant, intrusive thoughts (Q16).\n- **Interpersonal Withdrawal:** The patient reports pulling away from friends and family (Q20).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of little interest in activities (Q1), feelings of sadness (Q2), and changes in sleep (Q4 and Q14) are indicative.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Persistent feelings of anxiety (Q6), panic attacks (Q7), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) are significant.\n- **Panic Disorder:** Recurring panic attacks (Q7) and fear of having future attacks (Q8) are key symptoms.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Though not directly assessed, symptoms like detachment (Q18) and avoidance behaviors could suggest PTSD, but further evaluation is needed.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), indicating a risk that needs immediate attention.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient denies excessive alcohol or drug use (Q21 and Q23), which is positive but should be monitored.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms suggestive of co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders, primarily Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation without plans indicates a need for immediate risk assessment and management. The patient's reports of avoidance behaviors, sleep disturbances, and physical symptoms associated with panic attacks further highlight the complexity of their clinical presentation. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a detailed assessment of suicide risk, is warranted. Formulation of a treatment plan that addresses both depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as strategies for coping with panic attacks, is essential. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- 296.32 Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate, Single Episode\n- 300.21 Panic Disorder\n- 309.28 Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features \n\n**Treatment Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic evaluation\n- Development of a tailored treatment plan, potentially including psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and pharmacotherapy\n- Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and overall mental health status.\n\nThis summary focuses on the patient's reported symptoms and avoids speculation, providing a foundation for further clinical evaluation and intervention.",

It's like you're carrying a heavy cloud with you everywhere, making everyday tasks and interactions feel daunting. Your reports of <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>racing thoughts</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like chest pain and shortness of breath highlight the complexity of your emotional and physical experiences. You've also shared feelings of hopelessness and <quote>\"a cloud of sadness following me around, and it's hard to shake it off\"</quote>, which suggest a significant impact on your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to reported <sym>little interest in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of sadness</sym> (Q2), changes in <sym>sleep patterns</sym> (Q4 and Q14), and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11).
