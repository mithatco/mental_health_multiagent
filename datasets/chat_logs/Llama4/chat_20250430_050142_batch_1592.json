The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and hyperarousal suggest a possible diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and the depressive symptoms may indicate a diagnosis of MDD. The patient's risk factors, including suicidal ideation and desire to self-medicate, necessitate careful consideration and further assessment. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are warranted to address the patient's symptoms and concerns.",
