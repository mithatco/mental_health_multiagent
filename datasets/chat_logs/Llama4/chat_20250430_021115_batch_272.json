Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, along with irritability and sleep disturbances. The presence of panic attacks, repetitive thoughts, and behaviors further supports the need for a comprehensive evaluation. The patient's reports of feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, and detached from others and themselves highlight the severity of their mental health concerns. Clinical significance is noted in the areas of anxiety, depression, and potential obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The patient's responses indicate a high level of distress and impairment in daily functioning. A thorough diagnostic evaluation and consideration of treatment options, including therapy and possibly medication, are warranted. \n\n DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult: \nThe patient's responses on the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult highlight significant distress across multiple domains, particularly in anxiety, depression, and irritability.
