We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist did not abruptly change topics or fail to follow up on concerning disclosures. The conversation had a coherent and logical progression, making it easy to follow and understand.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a clear explanation for the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, hearing voices, and feelings of hopelessness.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were a few moments where the language seemed slightly formal or technical. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more emotional support and validation. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's distress."

The therapist successfully explored all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise clinical language and enhanced emotional support, the overall performance was strong.",
