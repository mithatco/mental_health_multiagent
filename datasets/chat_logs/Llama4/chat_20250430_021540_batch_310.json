However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly moved to a new topic without fully exploring the patient's previous disclosures (e.g., moving from Q10 to Q11). Overall, the conversation was coherent, but could have benefited from smoother transitions and more follow-up questions.",

However, the justification could have been stronger with more explicit links to DSM-5 criteria and a discussion of differential diagnoses. The therapist generally stayed on track but could have explored alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms.",
