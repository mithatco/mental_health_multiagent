You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and it's like you're just going through the motions of daily life without much enthusiasm. <quote>Things I used to enjoy don't really excite me anymore. It's like I'm just trying to get through each day.</quote> Your sleep has been affected, and you're experiencing anxiety and worry. You're also struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of detachment from yourself and others.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient reports <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6). Additionally, the patient experiences <sym>negative thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>feelings of detachment</sym> (Q18, Q20). These symptoms have significant impairment in daily functioning, and the patient's report of feeling \"empty\" and disconnected from themselves and others suggests potential <med>dissociative symptoms</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that includes <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT), to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Exploration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Encouragement of <med>self-care strategies</med>, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and make adjustments as needed.",
