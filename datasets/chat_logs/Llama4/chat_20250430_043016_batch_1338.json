Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to assess various aspects of your mental health. This tool helps us identify areas that might need further exploration and ensures we address all relevant concerns. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Your responses also indicate <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, but they seem to be secondary to the anxiety and panic experiences.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>panic disorder</sym> and <med>agoraphobia</med>.\n2. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or benzodiazepines for short-term relief of <sym>panic symptoms</sym>.\n3. Development of a coping plan to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and reduce <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n5.
