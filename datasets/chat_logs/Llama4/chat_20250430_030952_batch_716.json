        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) clearly aligned with the patient's responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria, providing a transparent and well-supported diagnostic conclusion.",

While the therapist was mostly warm and personalized in their interactions, there were a few instances where they could have been more emotionally responsive to the patient's distress. Overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone."
