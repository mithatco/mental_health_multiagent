This is a routine assessment to identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself.

The patient's responses suggest a strong link to a traumatic event, which may be contributing to their current symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use as a coping mechanism raises concerns for risk factors.
