Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a tool to help identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest a diagnosis of panic disorder.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder:** Depressed mood, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation indicate potential depressive disorder.\n- **Sleep Disturbance:** Significant sleep disturbances affecting overall well-being.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Multiple physical complaints and concerns.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves, indicating a significant risk factor.\n- **Severe Anxiety and Depression:** Co-occurring symptoms increase the risk of suicide and require immediate attention.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation characterized by co-occurring symptoms of panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and significant anxiety. The pervasive fear of panic attacks and depressive symptoms have led to substantial impairment in social and occupational functioning.

You feel <quote>\"really overwhelmed and anxious lately, so I haven't been enjoying things like I used to. It's hard to find pleasure in anything when I'm constantly worried about having a panic attack.\"</quote> Your <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> are concerning, and it's understandable that you're feeling <quote>\"down a lot. The panic attacks have made me feel like I'm losing control, and it's really brought me down. I sometimes feel hopeless like things are never going to get better.\"</quote>\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> with co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, persistent worry about having attacks, and avoidance behaviors. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports the need for immediate intervention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> diagnoses.\n2. Development of a treatment plan addressing <sym>panic disorder</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. Consideration of medication (e.g., <med>SSRIs</med>) and psychotherapy (e.g., <med>CBT</med>).\n4. Crisis intervention and safety planning given the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.",
