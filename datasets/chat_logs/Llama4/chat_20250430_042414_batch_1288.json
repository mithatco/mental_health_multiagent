Over the next short while, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like, and we can discuss any concerns you have. Let's begin with the first question.

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic Attacks:** The patient reports experiencing frequent panic attacks, constant fear of having another attack, and significant anxiety that interferes with daily life.\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** The patient expresses feelings of hopelessness, being down, and a general sense of helplessness, especially related to panic attacks.\n- **Irritability:** Increased irritability and short-temperedness, noted by both the patient and their family.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Reports of disrupted sleep quality, excessive sleeping, and non-restorative sleep.\n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** Avoids situations that might trigger anxiety or where help might not be readily available.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Fear:** A pervasive pattern of anxiety, fear of panic attacks, and their consequences is evident across multiple responses.\n- **Impact on Daily Life:** The patient's symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning, social relationships, and overall well-being.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Reports of physical symptoms such as stomach problems, headaches, and general aches and pains, attributed to anxiety.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of panic disorder, given the recurrent panic attacks and persistent concern or worry about having panic attacks.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder:** Depressive symptoms, such as persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities, may indicate co-occurring depression.\n- **Avoidant Personality Traits or Social Anxiety:** Avoidance of social or public situations due to fear of embarrassment or not being able to cope.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of it being easier if they didn't have to deal with their current situation anymore, indicating a low-level suicidal ideation.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to self-medicate, the desire to find something to help relax suggests a risk for potential substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of anxiety, particularly related to panic attacks, alongside depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. These symptoms contribute to considerable distress and impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not severe, requires careful assessment and management. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of panic disorder and major depressive disorder, with possible co-occurring anxiety disorders. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of an appropriate treatment plan are warranted.\n\n**DSM-5 Considerations:**\n- **Panic Disorder (300.21):** Recurrent panic attacks and persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (296.32):** Depressed mood or loss of interest and significant impairment.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02):** Persistent and excessive worry about everyday things.\n\n**Treatment Approach:**\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically panic-focused CBT and cognitive restructuring.\n- Pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered for both panic disorder and depressive symptoms.\n\n**Follow-Up:**\nClose monitoring of the patient's condition, particularly suicidal ideation, and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary. Regular follow-up appointments are crucial to assess progress and make any required modifications to the therapeutic approach.",

Your anxiety is affecting your relationships and daily life, and you're experiencing physical symptoms like stomach problems and headaches.
