This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
