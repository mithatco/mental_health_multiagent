They report significant distress, impairment in daily functioning, and cognitive difficulties. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not accompanied by a plan, warrants careful assessment and monitoring. The patient's responses suggest potential clinical significance in the areas of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, sleep-wake disorders, and cognitive difficulties. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address these concerns.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n* Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n* Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)\n* Insomnia Disorder\n* Cognitive impairment (further evaluation needed)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Further evaluation and diagnostic assessment to confirm or rule out potential diagnoses.\n* Development of a treatment plan addressing depressive, anxious, and sleep-related symptoms.\n* Close monitoring of suicidal ideation and risk factors.\n* Consideration of psychotherapy and/or pharmacological interventions to address symptoms and improve daily functioning.",

You're also experiencing persistent sadness, feeling down, and hopelessness. These feelings are coupled with anxiety, making you feel like you're constantly on edge and worried about something going wrong. Your sleep has been significantly affected, with early morning wake-up times and difficulty falling back asleep. You're not feeling connected to others, and social situations make you anxious. You're experiencing <sym>unpleasant thoughts</sym> about not being good enough and feeling like a burden to others.
