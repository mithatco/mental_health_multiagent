The patient's coping mechanisms, including avoidance behaviors and substance use, may be exacerbating symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use necessitates immediate attention to ensure patient safety and develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing these concerns. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these impressions and guide treatment.",

I used to love driving, but now it just feels like too much.\"</quote>. The accident seems to have had a profound impact on your life, causing <sym>intrusive memories</sym>, <sym>nightmares</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that affect your daily functioning. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive memories</sym> of the traumatic event (Q16), <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), and <sym>hyperarousal symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7). Additionally, the patient reports <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>little interest or pleasure in activities</sym> (Q1) and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2), which are characteristic of <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) further underscores the need for immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough risk assessment for <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and develop a safety plan to ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n2. Initiate trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. Implement cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n4.
