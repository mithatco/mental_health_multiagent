The therapist explored depression, anxiety, irritability, energy/activity, somatic concerns, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, sleep quality, cognitive function, repetitive thoughts/behaviors, dissociation, identity and relationships, and substance use. The comprehensive coverage allowed for a thorough assessment of the patient's mental health.",

The questions were phrased in a clinically accurate way that aligned with DSM-5 criteria.",

The questions logically built on previous responses, creating a smooth conversational arc.",

The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance behaviors, and negative changes in mood and cognition, to justify the diagnoses. The differential diagnosis was comprehensively considered.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. The interactions were warm, personalized, and supportive, creating a safe space for the patient to express themselves."
