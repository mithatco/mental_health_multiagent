This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as openly and honestly as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and <sym>irritated</sym> in these situations, which can be really tough. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. You expressed a desire to work on your <sym>anxiety</sym> and feel more connected to others. I'm here to support you in exploring these challenges and finding ways to improve your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms, as reported through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult, align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient experiences significant <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>fear</sym> in social situations, leading to avoidance behaviors (Q6, Q8). The patient's reports of <sym>physical symptoms</sym> such as a racing heart, sweating, and stomach issues when anxious (Q9) further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, although not severe, may be related to their social anxiety and avoidance behaviors (Q2). A comprehensive evaluation and potential <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based treatments may help alleviate these symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or other evidence-based treatments to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Develop a coping plan to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, including gradual exposure to feared social situations.\n4. Explore relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness, to help manage <sym>physical symptoms</sym> associated with anxiety.\n5. Regularly review and adjust the treatment plan as needed to ensure optimal progress and symptom management.",
