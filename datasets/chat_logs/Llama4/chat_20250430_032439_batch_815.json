Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as honest as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and like you're just going through the motions of life without any real sense of purpose or excitement. <quote>It's like I'm watching myself from outside my body. It's like I'm not really living, just observing life.</quote> Your sleep is disrupted, and you're experiencing a lot of physical symptoms like back pain and headaches. You're also worried about your future and feel like you're not being taken seriously. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, which are core symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> may be symptoms of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> or a co-occurring <med>anxiety disorder</med>. The patient's <quote>feelings of emptiness</quote> and <quote>detachment from life</quote> suggest a significant level of distress and impairment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that includes <med>pharmacotherapy</med>, such as antidepressant medication, and <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT).\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Consider referral to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or a therapist, for ongoing support and treatment.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
