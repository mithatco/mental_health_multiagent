This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being and inform our work together. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
