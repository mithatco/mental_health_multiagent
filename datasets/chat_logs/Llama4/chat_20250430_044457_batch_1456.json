This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health and well-being. I want to assure you that our conversation is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions that cover various aspects of mental health. I'm here to listen and support you. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'in the past two weeks' to align more closely with the DSM-5 timeframe. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like depressed mood, anhedonia, and increased irritability to the diagnosis. However, the justification could have been strengthened by more explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses or considering alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms.",
        "empathy": "The therapist consistently demonstrated empathy and a natural conversational style. Responses were personalized, and the therapist acknowledged the patient's distress.
