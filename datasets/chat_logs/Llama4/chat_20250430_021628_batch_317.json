This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of decreased interest and pleasure, depressed mood, and irritability are concerning for a depressive disorder. Additionally, the patient's experiences of anxiety, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors suggest a possible anxiety disorder, potentially related to a traumatic event. The patient's sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties further complicate the clinical picture. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use also raise concerns for risk factors. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.",
