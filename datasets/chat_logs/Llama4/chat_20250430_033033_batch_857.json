You've expressed <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and it's clear that the accident has had a profound impact on your life, causing <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>post-traumatic stress symptoms</sym>. Your reports of feeling detached from yourself and others, and experiencing <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, albeit vague, are particularly concerning. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with <med>PTSD</med> due to the presence of <sym>re-experiencing</sym> (e.g., nightmares), <sym>avoidance</sym> (e.g., avoiding driving), <sym>negative cognitions and mood</sym> (e.g., feeling detached, hopeless), and <sym>arousal</sym> (e.g., irritability, sleep disturbances) following a traumatic event. The patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> also meet criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The co-occurrence of these conditions necessitates comprehensive treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. <med>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>Trauma-Focused CBT</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n2. <med>Antidepressant medication</med> to help manage <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> symptoms.\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.\n5. Consideration of <med>group therapy</med> or <med>support groups</med> to provide additional support and connection.",
