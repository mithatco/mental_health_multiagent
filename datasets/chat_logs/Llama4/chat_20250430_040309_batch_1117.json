You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and like you're just trying to get through each day. These feelings are clearly taking a toll on your life, affecting your sleep, motivation, and relationships. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Your reports of anxiety, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> suggest that you're experiencing a lot of distress. I'm here to support you and help you find ways to cope with these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15) are all consistent with MDD. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) suggest a high level of distress and impairment. While other diagnoses, such as <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, may also be considered, the patient's symptoms appear to be most closely aligned with MDD.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess and monitor symptoms, with a focus on <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Develop a <sym>sleep hygiene</sym> plan to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym> and address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them joy and help them feel connected to others, as a way to build <sym>resilience</sym> and <sym>social support</sym>.",
