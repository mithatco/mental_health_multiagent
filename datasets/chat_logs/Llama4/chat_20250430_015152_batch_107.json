Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment consists of 23 questions and will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen and support you throughout this process. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling to find joy in things you used to enjoy, and it's been really tough for you since your divorce. You mentioned feeling \"empty inside\" and going through the motions without much happiness. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life. Your feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability are understandable given your situation. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you without judgment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of depressive symptoms, including <sym>lack of interest or pleasure in activities</sym> (Q1), <sym>feeling down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), changes in sleep patterns (Q14), and <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q4). Additionally, you reported <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic</sym> (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8). These symptoms have been impacting your daily life and relationships. While your symptoms are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis of <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</med> or other conditions, they do suggest a need for further evaluation and support.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further discuss your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.\n4. Develop a self-care plan, including stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, exercise, or relaxation exercises.\n5. Encourage you to keep a symptom journal to track your emotions, sleep patterns, and any changes in symptoms.",
