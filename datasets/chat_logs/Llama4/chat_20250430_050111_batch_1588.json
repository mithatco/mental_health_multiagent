You've also reported <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like aches and pains. It's clear that these experiences have been impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I'll do my best to help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with <med>anxious distress</med> and <med>psychotic symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses suggest a complex symptom profile, characterized by <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> history also suggests a need for comprehensive assessment and treatment. The <med>DSM-5</med> criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> appear to be met, with <sym>persistent feelings of sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep and appetite</sym>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>hearing voices</sym> and <sym>feeling like others can read thoughts</sym> suggest <med>psychotic symptoms</med> that require further evaluation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough clinical interview and medical history, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and <sym>psychotic symptoms</sym>, including consideration of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.\n3. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>psychodynamic therapy</med> to address <sym>cognitive distortions</sym> and <sym>emotional regulation</sym>.\n4. <med>Medication</med> evaluation, including <med>antidepressants</med>, <med>antipsychotics</med>, and <med>anxiolytics</med>, to address <sym>symptoms</sym> and improve functioning.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
