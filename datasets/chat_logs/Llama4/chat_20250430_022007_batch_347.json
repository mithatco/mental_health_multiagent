I just feel so overwhelmed sometimes. I don't know what to do or how to make things better.\") suggests potential suicidal ideation, which warrants further exploration and assessment.\n2. **Substance Use:** Although the patient denies substance use (Q21-Q23), their desire to \"feel better without needing pills or something\" (Q23) may indicate a potential interest in self-medication.\n\n**Summary of Observations:** The patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by depressive, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, as well as interpersonal and emotional difficulties. The patient's recent divorce and reports of feeling overwhelmed and detached from themselves and others suggest potential trauma-related symptoms. The presence of suicidal ideation and desire for self-medication are concerning and require immediate attention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan addressing these symptoms and concerns are warranted.",

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, without any interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy <sym>anhedonia</sym>. You've also been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless <sym>depressed mood</sym>, with tears sometimes coming unexpectedly. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your relationships with friends and family. You expressed feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and uncertain about your future <quote>\"I just feel so overwhelmed sometimes. I don't know what to do or how to make things better.\"</quote>. Your experiences and emotions are valid, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n**<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>**\n\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and feelings of hopelessness <sym>hopelessness</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, their reports of <sym>irritability</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and avoidance behaviors suggest co-occurring <med>anxiety disorders</med>, potentially <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med> or <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's recent divorce and reports of feeling overwhelmed and detached from themselves and others may also suggest potential <med>trauma-related symptoms</med>, although further evaluation is needed to confirm this.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation: A thorough assessment, including a physical exam, psychological questionnaires, and a detailed interview, to confirm the diagnosis and identify any co-occurring conditions.\n2. Psychotherapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) may help address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and relationship difficulties.\n3. Pharmacological interventions: Depending on the diagnostic findings, medication may be considered to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, or sleep disturbances.\n4. Development of a crisis plan: Given the patient's reports of suicidal ideation, a crisis plan should be established, including emergency contact numbers and a plan for immediate support.\n5. Psychoeducation: Educating the patient about <med>MDD</med>, <med>anxiety disorders</med>, and trauma-related symptoms may help them better understand their experiences and treatment options.",
