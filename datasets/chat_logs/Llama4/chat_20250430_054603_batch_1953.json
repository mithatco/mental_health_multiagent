Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your mental health. This questionnaire will help us identify any areas that might be concerning and guide our conversation. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. The questionnaire consists of 23 questions, and I'll ask each one in turn. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their distress appears to be primarily related to social situations, which they avoid due to fear of negative evaluation and anxiety. Depressive symptoms, including low interest/pleasure and feeling down/depressed, are also reported. The patient's symptoms may meet criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder and potentially Major Depressive Disorder. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the presence and severity of these conditions. The patient's report of feeling detached from themselves and others (Q18) and struggling to form meaningful relationships (Q20) may also indicate areas for further exploration. Overall, the patient's symptoms suggest a need for targeted interventions to address their social anxiety and depressive symptoms.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and not really enjoying life as much as you'd like. You also shared that you get <sym>panicked</sym> and feel <sym>on edge</sym> when you're in social situations, which makes you want to avoid them altogether. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you without judgment.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (SAD) and <med>Depressive Disorder</med> NOS\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>excessive anxiety</sym> and <sym>fear</sym> in social situations, avoidance of social interactions, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like blushing, sweating, and trembling, align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, your reported <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as feeling down and lacking interest in activities, suggest a possible <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. However, more information is needed to determine the full diagnostic picture.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and behaviors contributing to social anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n2. Exposure therapy to help you gradually become comfortable in social situations and reduce avoidance behaviors.\n3. Medications, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and stress management techniques, to help alleviate <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n5. Further evaluation and assessment to determine the presence and severity of <med>Depressive Disorder</med> and other potential diagnoses.",
