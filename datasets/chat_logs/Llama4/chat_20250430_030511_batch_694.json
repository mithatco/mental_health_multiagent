This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their responses indicate trauma-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances. The patient's avoidance behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and hypervigilance may be indicative of PTSD. Additionally, their depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation require careful assessment and monitoring. The patient's substance use and coping mechanisms should also be explored further. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan should be developed to address these concerns.",
