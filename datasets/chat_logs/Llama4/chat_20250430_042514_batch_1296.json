Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might need more attention. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment will involve 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of emotional distress, avoidance behaviors, and suicidal ideation (without a plan) highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and potential development of a treatment plan to address these concerns. Further assessment and exploration of the patient's symptoms, as well as their psychosocial and medical history, are necessary to inform a precise diagnosis and effective treatment strategy.",

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions without any excitement or energy. <quote>\"It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting anymore.\"</quote> These feelings are clearly distressing and affecting your daily life. You also shared experiences of anxiety, feeling on edge, and avoiding social situations due to anxiety. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about your future.
