This tool helps us identify areas that might need further exploration and ensures we address any concerns you may have. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1.

I feel like I'm just pretending to be someone I'm not\")\n\n**Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports experiencing significant distress in social situations, which appears to be a common theme throughout their responses.\n* They exhibit symptoms of anxiety, depression, and irritability, which may be interrelated.\n* The patient reports avoiding situations that make them anxious, which may be perpetuating their social isolation.\n\n**Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): The patient's reported depressed mood, lack of interest in activities, and changes in sleep patterns may indicate depressive symptoms.\n* Anxiety Disorders: The patient's reports of anxiety, panic-like symptoms, and avoidance behaviors suggest potential anxiety disorders, such as Social Anxiety Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n* Interpersonal Relationships: The patient's difficulties with interpersonal relationships and feelings of disconnection may indicate issues with attachment or social skills.\n\n**Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation: Although the patient denied thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), their reported feelings of hopelessness and disconnection may indicate a risk for suicidal ideation or behaviors.\n* Functional impairment: The patient's avoidance behaviors and social anxiety may be impacting their daily life, relationships, and work performance.\n\n**Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and social anxiety, which appear to be interrelated. They report significant distress in social situations, avoidance behaviors, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships. The patient's symptoms may be indicative of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, or other mental health conditions. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's reported feelings of hopelessness and disconnection warrant careful monitoring for suicidal ideation or behaviors.",

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and that you've been experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym> in situations that make you feel uncomfortable or judged. <quote>\"I feel like I'm just pretending to be someone I'm not, so it's hard to get close\"</quote> to others.

Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <med>social anxiety</med> and <med>depressive symptoms</med>.\n2. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>stress</sym>.\n3. A thorough diagnostic evaluation to assess for co-occurring mental health conditions, such as <med>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med> or <med>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</med>.\n4. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, if necessary, and <med>psychotherapy</med> to address <med>symptoms of depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med>.",
