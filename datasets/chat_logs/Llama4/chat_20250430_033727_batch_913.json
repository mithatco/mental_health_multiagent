This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings.

The conversation had a smooth progression, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's mental health.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a deep sense of emptiness and disconnection from things that used to bring you joy. You described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a weight that feels like it's on you all the time. Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're waking up early with a racing mind. You're also experiencing anxiety and worry about the future, which is making it hard for you to feel at ease. You've been avoiding social situations and feeling distant from others, which is adding to your sense of isolation. <quote>It's like I'm just going through the motions</quote>. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you through this difficult time.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate Severity</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your reported symptoms of <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>lack of interest in activities</sym> align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The patient's reported <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> may be comorbid or related to the depressive episode. The <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> may be symptoms of the depression or related to another condition. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is necessary to confirm this impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any comorbid conditions.\n2.
