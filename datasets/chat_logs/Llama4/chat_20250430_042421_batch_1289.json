Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive disorders (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder)\n* Anxiety disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder)\n* Sleep-wake disorders (e.g., Insomnia Disorder)\n* Cognitive difficulties (e.g., attention, memory)\n\n**4.

Summary of Observations in Clinical Language:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxious, and sleep-related symptoms. They report experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, and hopelessness, which have led to a significant decrease in motivation and interest in previously enjoyed activities. The patient's sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and social withdrawal are likely contributing to their overall distress. The presence of suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness necessitate careful assessment and consideration of safety planning. Further evaluation and potential referral to specialized care are warranted to address these concerns.",

Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're having trouble remembering things and learning new information. <quote>I just feel like I'm going through the motions.</quote> These challenges are clearly taking a toll on your well-being, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), as they report experiencing a depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in sleep patterns, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulties with concentration. The presence of suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed are also consistent with MDD. The patient's responses to the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult suggest a high level of distress and impairment in daily life, social relationships, and occupational functioning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam and laboratory tests, to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym>.\n3. Pharmacological interventions, such as antidepressants, to help manage <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Development of a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
