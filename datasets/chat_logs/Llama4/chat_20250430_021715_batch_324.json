The assessment we're about to do is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I'll ask each one in turn. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's experiences of negative affect, avoidance behaviors, and somatic symptoms suggest significant distress and impairment. The presence of suicidal ideation and a history of trauma (not directly assessed) may indicate a higher level of risk. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan.",
