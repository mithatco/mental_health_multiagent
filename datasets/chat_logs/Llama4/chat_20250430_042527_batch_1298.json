      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling with a range of difficult emotions and experiences, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>post-traumatic stress symptoms</sym> following an accident. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and that nothing brings you joy, which can be really tough to deal with. It's clear that these symptoms are impacting your daily life and relationships. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share your experiences.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, with <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) indicating a potential <med>depressive episode</med>. Additionally, your reports of <sym>nightmares</sym> (Q4), <sym>flashbacks</sym> (Q16), and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q5, Q8) are consistent with <med>PTSD</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q7), and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> (Q17) also support a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and possibly <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <quote>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</quote> and <quote>trauma-focused CBT</quote> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider <quote>medication</quote> (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) to help manage <sym>depression</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track their symptoms and identify triggers.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
