This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your well-being and treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to answer as thoroughly as you can. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Mostly, questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",

The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to the diagnostic conclusion. However, it would have been beneficial to discuss and rule out other potential diagnoses more thoroughly. The justification provided was clear and generally sound.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. Responses were mostly personalized and acknowledged the patient's distress. However, there were moments where a deeper emotional acknowledgment could have been beneficial, such as when the patient discussed feeling detached from themselves.
