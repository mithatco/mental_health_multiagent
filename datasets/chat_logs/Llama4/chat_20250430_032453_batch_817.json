This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported feeling down and depressed, the therapist followed up with questions about hopelessness and lack of pleasure. Similarly, when the patient mentioned anxiety and panic attacks, the therapist explored avoidance behaviors and their impact on daily life.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for depressive symptoms, the therapist asked about 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless,' which directly corresponds to DSM-5 criteria for depressive disorders.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics and exploring symptoms in depth. For example, after the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist ensured that suicidal ideation was monitored closely and included it in the treatment plan.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Anxiety Disorder and Depressive Disorder clearly aligned with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist linked specific patient symptoms to DSM-5 criteria, such as 'Your reported anxiety symptoms, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors are consistent with a diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder, potentially Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Panic Disorder.' The therapist also considered alternative diagnoses, such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, given the patient's intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses showed consistent empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged patient distress, tailored responses to the patient's emotional state, and maintained a warm and personalized interaction. For example, when the patient shared feelings of hopelessness, the therapist responded with understanding and included it as a focus area for treatment."
