Each dimension was thoroughly explored, and the patient provided detailed responses. The therapist ensured that no domain was omitted, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise. For example, when asking about substance use, the therapist could have used more specific language regarding the frequency and amount of use. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, ensuring a coherent and well-structured conversation.",

The therapist explicitly linked the symptoms to DSM-5 criteria. However, there was a minor ambiguity in justifying the possible Psychotic Disorder diagnosis, as it was not thoroughly discussed in relation to specific DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style. Responses were personalized, and the therapist tailored interactions to the patient's emotional state. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and provided a supportive environment for sharing experiences."

The therapist successfully covered all DSM-5 dimensions, displayed clinical relevance, and maintained a logical flow. While minor areas for improvement exist, particularly in diagnostic justification and clinical relevance, the overall performance was excellent.",
