This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as honestly as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's avoidance of social situations due to fear of embarrassment or judgment, along with sleep disturbances and ruminative thoughts, are particularly noteworthy. These symptoms suggest potential diagnoses of Social Anxiety Disorder and possibly a depressive disorder. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the presence and severity of these conditions and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

Overall, questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from minor adjustments for precision.",
