The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
