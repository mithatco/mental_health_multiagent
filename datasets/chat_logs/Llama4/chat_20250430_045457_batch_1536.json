I'll be asking you a series of 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling on edge, panic, and avoidance behaviors, further supports the specifier of anxious distress. The patient's reported symptoms meet the threshold for a diagnosis of MDD, and the anxious distress specifier is warranted given the significant impact of anxiety on daily life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n2. Develop a <med>sleep hygiene</med> plan to improve sleep quality and duration.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Encourage <med>mindfulness practices</med>, such as meditation or yoga, to reduce stress and increase feelings of calm and relaxation.\n5.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a significant amount of emotional pain and distress. You mentioned feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> a lot, and that things that used to bring you joy no longer do. You also shared that you're experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, which can be really overwhelming. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with daily life right now, and that you're feeling <quote>lost</quote> and unsure about your future. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that I'm taking your concerns seriously.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (MDD), including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling on edge, panic, and avoidance behaviors, further supports the specifier of anxious distress. The patient's reported symptoms meet the threshold for a diagnosis of MDD, and the anxious distress specifier is warranted given the significant impact of anxiety on daily life.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n2. Develop a <med>sleep hygiene</med> plan to improve sleep quality and duration.\n3. Explore <med>medication options</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to help alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n4. Encourage <med>mindfulness practices</med>, such as meditation or yoga, to reduce stress and increase feelings of calm and relaxation.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
