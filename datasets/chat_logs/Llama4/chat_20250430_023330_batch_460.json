      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling with a range of difficult emotions and experiences, feeling disconnected from things that used to bring you joy, and carrying a heavy emotional weight. You've described <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>nightmares</sym> related to a past accident, and it's clear that these have significantly impacted your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. Your feelings of <quote>\"not knowing who you really are or what you want out of life\"</quote> and <quote>\"not feeling close to other people\"</quote> suggest a deep sense of disconnection and uncertainty.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med>, including <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>negative changes in mood and cognition</sym> following a traumatic event. The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, such as <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The patient's increased alcohol consumption may be indicative of <sym>self-medication</sym> to cope with distressing emotions.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy for trauma (CBT-T)</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n2. Develop a treatment plan for <med>MDD</med>, potentially including <med>antidepressant medication</med> and <med>psychotherapy</med> focused on <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in <sym>stress management</sym> techniques, such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises.\n4. Monitor and address <sym>substance use</sym> through regular check-ins and potential <med>substance use disorder treatment</med>.\n5. Consider <med>family therapy</med> to support relationship dynamics and coping strategies.",
