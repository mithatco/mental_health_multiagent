Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your symptoms. This is a self-rated tool that helps us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment will consist of 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
