While depressive symptoms are not a primary concern, the patient reports experiencing \"down days\" and lacking motivation. The patient's responses suggest clinically significant anxiety symptoms, and their sleep disturbances may be related to these symptoms.

You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and lacking motivation, especially when it comes to social interactions. <quote>I'm worried about being judged or saying something embarrassing</quote>. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses suggest a pattern of clinically significant anxiety symptoms, particularly in social situations, which lead to avoidant behaviors and sleep disturbances. The patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's symptoms do not appear to meet the full criteria for a <med>depressive disorder</med>, but rather seem to be primarily driven by anxiety.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative self-talk</sym> and <sym>worries about social situations</sym>.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to manage <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices to improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
