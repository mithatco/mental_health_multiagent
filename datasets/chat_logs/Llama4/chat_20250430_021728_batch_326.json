You mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and that it's hard to explain, but you just feel empty and hopeless sometimes. It's like nothing matters, and you're just trying to get through each day. I can sense the weight of these feelings on you, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's reports of <sym>decreased interest</sym> and <sym>feelings of sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q1, Q2) are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Additionally, their experiences of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>fear</sym> (Q6), as well as <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8), suggest <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.
