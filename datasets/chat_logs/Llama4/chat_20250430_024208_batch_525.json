I'm here to support you, and I want to start by introducing the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This tool helps us understand your mental health across various domains. It's a way for us to identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions. I'll ask each one in turn, and you can share your thoughts and feelings. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
