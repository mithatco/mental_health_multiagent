Your sleep has been disrupted, and you're experiencing <sym>fatigue</sym> and <sym>memory problems</sym>. You're also avoiding social situations due to <sym>anxiety</sym>, which is leading to feelings of isolation.

Additionally, your reports of <sym>anxiety</sym>, <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> suggest a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> without a plan is a concern that will need to be addressed in treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. In-depth diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy</med> (CBT), and potentially <med>pharmacological interventions</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. <med>Sleep hygiene</med> practices and <med>relaxation techniques</med> to address <sym>sleep disturbance</sym>.\n4. <med>Social support</med> and <med>counseling</med> to address feelings of isolation and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5.
