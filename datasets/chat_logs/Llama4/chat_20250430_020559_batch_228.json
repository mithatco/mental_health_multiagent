Today, we'll be going through the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your mental health across different domains. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking each one in turn. Your responses will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen without judgment, and I want to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. Let's begin with the first question. I. Mood 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You described feeling like you're \"going through the motions\" and experiencing a heavy weight on your shoulders, which sounds incredibly difficult. It's clear that you're dealing with <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and it's affecting your daily life. Your reports of <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> also suggest that you're under a lot of emotional distress. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you work through these challenges.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as indicated by <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>changes in appetite or sleep</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, and <sym>feelings of worthlessness or guilt</sym>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> could suggest co-occurring <med>anxiety disorders</med>, but <med>MDD</med> seems to be the primary concern.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm <med>MDD</med> and assess for co-occurring conditions.\n2. Develop a <sym>suicidal risk assessment</sym> and create a safety plan to ensure the patient's immediate safety.\n3. Explore <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>dissociation</sym> further to understand their impact on daily life.\n4. Recommend <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n5. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants, to help manage <med>MDD</med> symptoms.\n6.
