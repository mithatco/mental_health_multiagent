The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment and well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics and adequately addressing all concerns raised by the patient. For example, after the patient discussed sleep disturbances, the therapist logically segued into questions about cognitive impairment and physical symptoms.",

The therapist directly cited specific symptoms mentioned by the patient, such as 'feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities,' to support the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms.",
        "empathy": "Therapist responses consistently show empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, expressed understanding, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state.
