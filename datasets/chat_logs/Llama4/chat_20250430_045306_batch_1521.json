I'm using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire to understand your experiences over the past two weeks. This is a self-rated tool that helps us identify areas that might need further exploration. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist successfully addressed all 23 questions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. Each dimension was thoroughly explored, and the patient provided detailed responses. The therapist ensured that all relevant areas, including depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation, were covered. The only potential area for improvement could be in probing deeper into certain domains, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clear and aligned with clinical terminology. For example, when asking about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things,' the therapist captured the essence of depressive symptoms as per DSM-5. The questions were phrased in a way that was easy for the patient to understand and respond to, making the assessment clinically relevant and accurate.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from the patient's previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, avoiding abrupt topic changes or non-sequiturs. When the patient disclosed concerning symptoms, such as suicidal ideation, the therapist appropriately followed up and ensured that the conversation remained focused and relevant. The consistency and logical flow contributed to a clear and comprehensive assessment.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress was clearly justified by the patient's symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the diagnostic conclusions to specific DSM-5 criteria and the patient's responses. For example, the patient's reports of 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless' and 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' were directly tied to the diagnosis of MDD. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was sound, and the therapist considered relevant differential diagnoses.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style throughout the interaction. Responses were personalized and acknowledged the patient's distress. For instance, when the patient discussed feeling hopeless, the therapist responded with understanding and concern.
