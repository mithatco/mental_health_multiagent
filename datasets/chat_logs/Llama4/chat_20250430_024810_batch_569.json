I mean\") may indicate passive suicidal ideation, which requires further exploration.\n2. **Emotional Distress:** The patient's overall emotional distress and avoidance behavior may indicate a risk for suicidal behavior or self-harm.\n\n**Summary:** The patient presents with significant emotional distress, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. The patient's avoidance behavior and somatic symptoms may be indicative of underlying mental health concerns. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's responses suggest a moderate to high level of clinical significance, and a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted to address potential mental health concerns.",
