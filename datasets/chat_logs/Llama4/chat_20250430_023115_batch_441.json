Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might need more attention. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their responses suggest potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorders. The patient's emotional dysregulation, irritability, and avoidance behaviors are concerning. Furthermore, the patient's report of suicidal ideation and desire to escape their emotional pain warrants careful assessment and intervention.

You mentioned that things you used to enjoy no longer bring you pleasure, and you're experiencing <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> on a regular basis. Your sleep patterns have been disrupted, and you're dealing with <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like headaches and stomachaches. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope and feeling really lost about who you are and what you want out of life. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and important.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with diagnostic criteria for <med>MDD</med>, including <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> (Q1), changes in <sym>sleep patterns</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> (Q9). Additionally, their reports of <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), <sym>worry</sym>, and <sym>fear</sym> (Q6) across multiple domains suggest <med>GAD</med>. The patient's <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3) and emotional dysregulation also support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of <med>MDD</med> and <med>GAD</med> symptoms.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>, under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <sym>self-care activities</sym>, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques, to help manage stress and anxiety.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the plan as needed.",
