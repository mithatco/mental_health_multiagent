This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
