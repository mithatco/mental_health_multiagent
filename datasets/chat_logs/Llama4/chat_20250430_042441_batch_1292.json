The patient's reports suggest potential diagnostic criteria for MDD and an anxiety disorder, with possible PTSD symptoms.

You described feeling like you're constantly on edge, worried about having panic attacks, and struggling with sleep. It's clear that these experiences have been incredibly challenging for you, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable that you're seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with co-occurring <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>interpersonal difficulties</sym>. The patient's reports of <quote>feeling down and disconnected</quote> (Q1), <quote>feeling like I'm constantly on edge</quote> (Q6), and <quote>having panic attacks</quote> (Q7) indicate potential diagnostic criteria for <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and desire for relief from panic attacks highlight the need for careful risk assessment and treatment planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that addresses the patient's specific needs and concerns, including <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>medication</med> as potential treatment options.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their experiences and identify patterns.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
