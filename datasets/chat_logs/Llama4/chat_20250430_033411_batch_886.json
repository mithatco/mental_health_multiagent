This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The presence of panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and somatic complaints further complicates the clinical picture. The patient's reports of suicidal ideation without intent or plan necessitate a thorough suicide risk assessment. Overall, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is warranted to accurately identify the patient's specific mental health conditions and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been experiencing a profound sense of disconnection from things that used to bring you joy, coupled with a persistent feeling of sadness that seems to shadow your daily life. You described feeling like you're on edge all the time, with <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> that sometimes feels overwhelming. These emotions are compounded by <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are terrifying and have led you to avoid certain situations. It's clear that your mental health struggles are significantly impacting your daily functioning and overall well-being. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable that you're seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms align closely with both <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The <sym>persistent sadness</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, and changes in sleep patterns are indicative of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. Simultaneously, the <sym>excessive worry</sym>, <sym>fear</sym>, <sym>panic attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> point towards an <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>somatic complaints</sym> such as unexplained aches and pains could suggest <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, but it's less prominent compared to the depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the diagnoses and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This form of therapy can help you manage your <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\n3. **Medication:** A psychiatrist can discuss the possibility of using antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to help manage symptoms.\n4. **Lifestyle Changes:** Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a balanced diet, and practicing stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness or meditation can support mental health.\n5. **Support System:** Building or reconnecting with a support network of friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.\n6. **Regular Follow-Up:** Schedule regular check-ins with your mental health provider to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
