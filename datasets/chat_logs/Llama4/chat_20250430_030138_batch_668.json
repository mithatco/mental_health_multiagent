You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and being really hard on yourself. It's clear that these experiences are impacting your daily life and causing you distress. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and responses suggest a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient reports significant distress in social situations (Q6, Q7, Q8), fearing judgment and experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3). The patient's avoidance behaviors (Q8) and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q14) also support this diagnosis. While the patient reports some <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2), they do not appear to be severe enough to warrant a separate depressive disorder diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n3. Exploration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> as potential pharmacological interventions for <med>social anxiety disorder</med>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
