You mentioned that you often feel like you're just going through the motions, and things that used to bring you joy, like painting, now feel like a chore. You also shared that you experience <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations, which leads you to avoid them altogether. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Based on your responses, it appears that you're experiencing symptoms consistent with <med>social anxiety disorder</med>, such as <sym>excessive and persistent fear or anxiety</sym> in social situations, <sym>avoidance of social situations</sym>, and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like blushing, sweating, and trembling. Additionally, your reports of feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> and experiencing a lack of pleasure in activities suggest a possible <med>depressive disorder</med>. Your symptoms do not seem to meet the full criteria for a <med>somatic symptom disorder</med>, and there's no indication of a <med>psychotic disorder</med> or severe <med>substance use</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and behaviors associated with <med>social anxiety disorder</med>.\n2. A thorough diagnostic evaluation to determine the presence and severity of a <med>depressive disorder</med>.\n3. Development of a coping plan to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym> symptoms in social situations.\n4. Exploration of relaxation techniques, such as <med>deep breathing exercises</med> or <med>progressive muscle relaxation</med>, to help manage <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.\n5.
