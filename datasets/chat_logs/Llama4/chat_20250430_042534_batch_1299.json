This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open and honest as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's symptoms may be indicative of anxiety and depressive disorders, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying causes and develop an effective treatment plan.

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of distress and feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling anxious and on edge, with <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym> and a tendency to avoid situations that make you anxious. You also shared that you're feeling disconnected from activities you used to enjoy and experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>. It's clear that you're struggling with these feelings and are looking for support. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>feeling nervous, anxious, and on edge</sym> (Q6), <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym> (Q7), and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8), are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>feeling detached from others</sym> (Q20) and <sym>difficulty connecting with people</sym> (Q20) may indicate social withdrawal. While the patient also reports <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q2), they do not appear to be severe enough to warrant a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and behaviors associated with social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to help the patient gradually become comfortable in social situations.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to manage <sym>anxiety and stress</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for symptom management, if deemed necessary.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
