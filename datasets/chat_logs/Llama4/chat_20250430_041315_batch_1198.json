      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with a deep sense of emptiness, feeling like things you used to enjoy don't excite you anymore. You've been experiencing <sym>low mood</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and it's hard for you to explain, but it feels like nothing matters. You're also experiencing <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, and worried about your future. Your sleep has been affected, and you're waking up early, feeling exhausted. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's impacting your daily life.\n\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress\n\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, changes in sleep patterns, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are consistent with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, suggests that anxious distress is also a significant factor. The patient's reports of feeling detached or distant from themselves and others may indicate <med>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</med>, but there is not enough information to make a definitive diagnosis.\n\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation**: A thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, lab tests, and a psychological assessment, to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT) may be effective in addressing <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. **Pharmacological interventions**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may be considered to help manage <med>depressive symptoms</med> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n4. **Sleep hygiene practices**: Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine may help improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n5. **Social support**: Encouraging the patient to reconnect with friends and family, or joining a support group, may help alleviate <sym>social withdrawal</sym> and improve overall well-being.",
