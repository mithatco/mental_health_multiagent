Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressive symptoms: reported feeling disconnected from activities, down, depressed, and hopeless (Q1, Q2).\n* Anxiety symptoms: endorsed feeling anxious, worried, and on edge (Q6), with panic attacks (Q7) and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations (Q8).\n* Irritability and anger: reported increased frustration and irritability (Q3).\n* Substance use: disclosed using substances to cope, including potential misuse of prescription medications and other substances (Q4, Q23).\n* Sleep disturbances: reported problems with sleep quality (Q14) and using substances to aid sleep.\n\n**2.

Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical profile, characterized by co-occurring depressive, anxious, and irritability symptoms. Substance use is reported as a coping mechanism, which may indicate a risk for substance use disorders. Sleep disturbances and significant distress in daily life, including relationships, are also reported. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not severe, warrants careful assessment and monitoring. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan.",

You also mentioned feeling <sym>anxious, worried, and on edge</sym> much of the time, with <sym>panic attacks</sym> and a tendency to avoid situations that make you anxious. It's clear that you're finding it tough to cope, and you've been using substances to try and manage your emotions. <quote>\"I guess I just feel like I'm stuck in a rut.\"</quote> It takes a lot of courage to share this, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate Severity, with Anxious Distress</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>low interest and pleasure</sym> (Q1), <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> (Q2), and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6) meet the criteria for a <med>depressive disorder</med>.

Additionally, your reported substance use (Q23) may indicate a risk for <med>substance use disorders</med>, which often co-occur with mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to conduct a more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history.\n2. Consider initiating <med>pharmacotherapy</med> with an antidepressant medication, such as an SSRI, to help manage depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3.
