You've shared that there are times when you just don't care about anything, and it feels like you're going through the motions. You've also talked about feeling lost and unsure about who you are and what you want out of life. <quote>It's like nothing good ever happens and I don't see a way out</quote>. It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of distress and impairment across multiple areas of your life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Mood Disorder with Anxious Distress, Provisional</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest a complex clinical profile, with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>there are times when I just don't care about anything</quote>), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (e.g., <quote>anxious? all the time</quote>), and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> (e.g., buying a car on impulse). The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> are notable risk factors. While the symptoms could suggest multiple diagnoses, a <med>Mood Disorder with Anxious Distress</med> seems to capture the essence of your experiences. However, further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to conduct a more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</med> to address <sym>emotional dysregulation</sym> and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym>.\n3. Develop a <med>suicide safety plan</med> to ensure your safety and provide resources for crisis intervention.\n4. Encourage <med>substance use counseling</med> to address <sym>substance use</sym> and develop strategies for relapse prevention.\n5. Explore <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to improve <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and overall well-being.",
