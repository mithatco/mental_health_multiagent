The reasoning behind each diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and clinically sound, directly citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient and linking them to DSM-5 criteria.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the responses seemed somewhat formulaic or lacking in emotional depth. For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance or explored the emotions behind these thoughts in greater depth."
