Your reports of <sym>hearing voices</sym> and feeling like others can read your mind are distressing and may indicate some level of psychological distress. It's understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to cope.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder</med> with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Reasoning:** \nYour symptoms, such as <sym>hearing voices</sym> (Q12), feeling like others can read your mind (Q13), and experiencing <sym>detachment from yourself</sym> (Q18), suggest potential psychotic symptoms. The presence of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) further support the consideration of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> as part of your clinical presentation.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that addresses your <sym>depressive</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and potential <sym>psychotic</sym> symptoms, potentially involving a combination of medication and therapy.\n3. Consideration of <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>family therapy</med> to address coping skills, relationships, and support systems.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
