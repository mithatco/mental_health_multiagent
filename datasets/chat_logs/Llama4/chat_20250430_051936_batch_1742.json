This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

I feel like I'm just going through the motions most of the time, and even things I used to love don't bring me as much joy as they used to. It's like I'm just too worried about everything else to really engage."
