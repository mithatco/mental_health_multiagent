The patient's avoidance of social situations and fear of negative evaluation may be contributing to their distress and impairment. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Further evaluation:** Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview and consider administering additional assessment tools to confirm the patient's diagnoses.\n2. **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT):** Consider CBT as a treatment approach to address the patient's social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and anxious arousal.\n3. **Psychoeducation:** Provide the patient with psychoeducation on anxiety, depression, and social anxiety disorders, as well as coping strategies and stress management techniques.",

The patient's <sym>anxious arousal</sym> and <sym>fear of negative evaluation</sym> are consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address the patient's <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2.
