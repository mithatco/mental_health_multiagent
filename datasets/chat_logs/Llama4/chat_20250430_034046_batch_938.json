The patient's reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and lacking enjoyment in life, suggest a potential diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of social anxiety, fear of being judged or evaluated, and avoidance of social situations, are consistent with Social Anxiety Disorder. The patient's sleep disturbances and physical symptoms (e.g., blushing, sweating, trembling) also contribute to the overall clinical picture.

Schedule a follow-up appointment to conduct a more in-depth diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3.

Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track their <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym> symptoms and identify potential triggers.\n5.
