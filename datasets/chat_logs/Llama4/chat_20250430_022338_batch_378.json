I'm here to support you, and I want to start by introducing the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire. This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your experiences. Over the next session, we'll go through 23 questions to get a comprehensive view of your current mental health. I'll ask each question one at a time, and you can respond in as much detail as you feel comfortable. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic episodes are impacting daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. The presence of suicidal ideation and avoidance behaviors warrants close monitoring and targeted interventions.

You've expressed a sense of disconnection from activities you once enjoyed and from others. <quote>I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately, and I haven't been enjoying the things I used to</quote>. Your experience of panic attacks, persistent worry, and fear are clearly distressing and affect your daily life significantly. You also mentioned feelings of suicidal ideation, which is very concerning and requires immediate attention. I want you to know that I'm here to support you and help you navigate through these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest co-occurring <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>. The <sym>panic episodes</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> are indicative of <med>PTSD</med>. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym> meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> further supports the need for immediate attention and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, <med>trauma-focused CBT</med>, or <med>eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)</med> to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. Implement <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>, to manage <sym>depression</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n4. Provide <med>crisis intervention</med> and <med>suicide prevention</med> strategies to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
