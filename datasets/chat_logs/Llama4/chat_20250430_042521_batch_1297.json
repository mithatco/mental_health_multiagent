You feel <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>down</sym> on yourself, and it's affecting your relationships and daily life. You also experience <sym>manic episodes</sym> with increased energy, reduced need for sleep, and impulsive behaviors. It's clear that you're dealing with a lot, and I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n*Bipolar Disorder, Current Episode Depressive, Moderate*\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Current Episode Depressive, Moderate</med>. The patient's report of <sym>depressive episodes</sym> with <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym> meets the criteria for a depressive episode. Additionally, the patient's experience of <sym>manic episodes</sym> with <sym>increased energy</sym> and <sym>impulsive behaviors</sym> suggests a manic episode. The presence of both depressive and manic episodes supports a diagnosis of <med>Bipolar Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan to address <sym>depressive episodes</sym>, <sym>manic episodes</sym>, and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med>, such as mood stabilizers or antidepressants, may be necessary to manage symptoms.\n4. <med>Psychotherapy</med>, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), may be beneficial in addressing <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and improving coping skills.\n5. Regular monitoring of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym> to ensure timely intervention. \n6. Consideration of <med>hospitalization</med> if <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> or <sym>substance use</sym> becomes severe.",
