You mentioned feeling anxious and on edge, and experiencing panic attacks. It's clear that you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's taking a toll on your relationships and overall well-being. <quote>\"I feel like I'm just going through the motions.\"</quote> Your sleep has also been impacted, and you're experiencing intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that are distressing. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and I'll do my best to help you navigate these challenges.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> provisional.\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms suggest co-occurring <med>OCD</med> and <med>MDD</med>. The intrusive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, and avoidance of certain situations are consistent with <med>OCD</med> (Q16, Q17, Q8). Additionally, your reported <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, <sym>disconnection from activities</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> meet criteria for <med>MDD</med> (Q1, Q2, Q14). The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and severe anxiety symptoms warrants careful consideration.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>OCD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>exposure and response prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to address <med>MDD</med> and <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n4. Encourage stress management techniques, such as <med>mindfulness</med> and <med>relaxation exercises</med>, to help cope with anxiety and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regularly assess and address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> throughout treatment.",
