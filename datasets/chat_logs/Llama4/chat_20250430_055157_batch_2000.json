Anxiety and sleep disturbances are also prominent. Cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems, and feelings of detachment from oneself and others are noted. The patient reports avoiding social situations and experiencing repetitive, negative thoughts. Suicidal ideation is present, although no plan is reported.
