Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n- **Anxiety in social situations:** The patient reports significant anxiety, worry, and fear related to social interactions, which leads to avoidance behaviors (Q6, Q7, Q8).\n- **Depressive feelings:** Though not constant, the patient experiences feelings of being down, particularly in relation to social anxiety (Q2).\n- **Irritability:** The patient notes irritability, primarily linked to worries about social perceptions (Q3).\n- **Sleep disturbances:** The patient experiences occasional sleep problems due to racing thoughts about social situations (Q4, Q14).\n- **Physical symptoms:** Reports of back pain and headaches, likely related to tension (Q9).\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:\n- **Social anxiety:** A predominant pattern of anxiety and avoidance related to social interactions, which seems to impact daily functioning and well-being.\n- **Internal distress:** The patient frequently mentions worries about social perceptions, fear of judgment, and anxiety in social situations, indicating internalized distress.\n- **Avoidance behaviors:** Avoids social events and situations due to anxiety (Q8).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n- **Social Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms align closely with social anxiety disorder, including fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others (Q6, Q7, Q8).\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Although not pervasive, feelings of hopelessness or being down, particularly in social contexts, might suggest a co-occurring depressive disorder (Q2).\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Generalized anxiety symptoms, such as persistent worry and physical symptoms like restlessness, might indicate an anxiety disorder (Q6, Q9).\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n- **Suicidal ideation:** Denied (Q11).\n- **Substance use:** Denied (Q21, Q22, Q23).\n- **Psychotic symptoms:** Denied (Q12, Q13).\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\nThe patient presents with **predominant symptoms of social anxiety disorder**, characterized by significant distress and avoidance of social situations due to fear of negative evaluation. **Subthreshold depressive symptoms** are reported, particularly in the context of social interactions. The patient also experiences **sleep disturbances** and **somatic complaints**, likely exacerbated by anxiety. No immediate **risk factors** such as suicidal ideation or substance use were identified. These observations suggest the need for a comprehensive assessment to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan focused on social anxiety, with consideration for possible co-occurring depressive symptoms.\n\n**DSM-5 Diagnosis to Consider:** \n- Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23)\n- Possible co-occurring Depressive Disorder (296.32)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Further evaluation with structured diagnostic interviews.\n- Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or exposure therapy for social anxiety.\n- Monitoring for depressive symptoms.\n\n**Confidentiality Notice:** This summary is for clinical purposes and protected under confidentiality laws.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with significant <sym>anxiety in social situations</sym>, which makes you feel <quote>like I'm just going through the motions</quote> and leads to avoidance behaviors. You experience <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> due to worries about being judged or saying something wrong. You also mentioned <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like back pain and headaches, likely related to tension. Your feelings of being down aren't constant but seem to be triggered by social anxiety. It's clear that these experiences are affecting your daily life and well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder (300.23)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, characterized by a persistent and excessive fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. This fear leads to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) and significant distress in social situations (Q6, Q7). The patient's <quote>constant worry about social perceptions</quote> and fear of negative evaluation also support this diagnosis. Additionally, subthreshold <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> are present, particularly in social contexts, but do not appear to be the primary concern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or exposure therapy to address <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n2. Monitoring for <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and consideration of co-occurring <med>Depressive Disorder</med> (296.32) if symptoms persist or worsen.\n3. Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym>.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to assess treatment efficacy and make adjustments as needed.",
