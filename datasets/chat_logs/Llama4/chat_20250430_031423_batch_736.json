The patient's responses suggest a significant impact on daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. The presence of suicidal ideation, although not imminent, warrants close monitoring and assessment. Cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances further complicate the clinical picture. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough assessment of trauma history and potential TBI, is necessary to inform treatment planning. The patient's increased alcohol use may be a coping mechanism, and substance use counseling may be beneficial. Overall, the patient's symptoms and concerns suggest a high level of clinical significance, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach is warranted.",
