Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, like there's a heavy weight on you all the time. These feelings are accompanied by <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> about various aspects of your life, including your job and relationships. You're also experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, waking up early and not being able to fall back asleep, and <sym>physical aches and pains</sym> like back pain and headaches. It's clear that these symptoms are affecting your daily life and relationships, and you're feeling lost and uncertain about your identity and future.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The report of <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> for an extended period, along with <sym>changes in sleep</sym>, <sym>fatigue</sym>, <sym>worthlessness</sym> or <sym>guilt</sym>, <sym>diminished ability to think or concentrate</sym>, and <sym>recurrent thoughts of death</sym> or suicidal ideation, supports this diagnosis. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> may indicate co-occurring conditions, but the depressive symptoms appear to be the primary concern.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a physical exam and lab tests, to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to symptoms.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy</med> to address depressive symptoms and improve coping strategies.\n3. Consideration of <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage depressive symptoms, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. Development of a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve sleep hygiene, increase physical activity, and enhance overall well-being.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
