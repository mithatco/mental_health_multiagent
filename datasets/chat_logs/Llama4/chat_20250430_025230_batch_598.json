All domains were covered, but some areas could have benefited from more in-depth exploration, such as the patient's substance use patterns and their impact on daily life. For example, the therapist could have asked follow-up questions about the patient's substance use to better understand its role in their coping mechanisms and potential contribution to their symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but some phrasing could have been more precise. For instance, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'or more than usual' to fully capture sleep disturbances. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have been more accurately worded to reflect DSM-5 terminology.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. However, there were a few instances where transitions could have been smoother. For example, after the patient disclosed thoughts of hurting themselves, the therapist could have immediately followed up with more probing questions or empathy. Despite this, the conversation maintained a coherent structure.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of PTSD, Substance Use Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder were generally supported by the patient's symptoms. The therapist explicitly linked the patient's feelings of being 'down,' 'irritated,' and 'anxious' to potential depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, the diagnostic justification could have been more comprehensive, including a clearer discussion of how the patient's symptoms meet specific DSM-5 criteria for each disorder.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their feelings. For example, the therapist noted that the patient's thoughts of hurting themselves were 'distressing' and offered support. However, there were moments where a deeper emotional connection could have been made, such as when the patient mentioned feeling 'lost' and unsure about their identity."
