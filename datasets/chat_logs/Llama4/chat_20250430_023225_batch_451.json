The patient's internalizing emotional style and avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations may be maintaining these symptoms. The presence of somatic complaints and suicidal ideation (albeit not intense) warrants further exploration. Overall, the patient's responses suggest potential clinical significance in the areas of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and sleep-wake disorders. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are recommended to address these concerns.",

You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and that everything feels like too much sometimes. <quote>I'm lucky to have a good life and all, but sometimes it just feels like everything is too much</quote>. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder, Moderate</med> and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern of depressive symptoms, including <sym>low mood</sym>, <sym>lack of interest</sym>, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q1, Q2).

The presence of <sym>somatic complaints</sym>, such as headaches and stomachaches (Q9), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) further support these diagnoses. The patient's internalizing emotional style and social isolation also contribute to the clinical impression.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.
