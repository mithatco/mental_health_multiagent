        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and ensured that the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses clearly align with DSM-5 responses, and the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision is explicitly stated and clinically sound. The therapist provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Anxiety Disorder symptoms, and Psychotic Symptoms (provisional). The justification for the diagnoses directly cites specific symptoms mentioned by the patient.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly show empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments where the interactions seemed slightly robotic or impersonal. For example, when the patient disclosed suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance and support. However, overall, the therapist maintained a professional tone and showed understanding of the patient's emotional state."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, showed empathy, and provided a clear diagnostic justification. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise phrasing of questions and immediate reassurance during sensitive disclosures, the overall performance was excellent.",
