The assessment we'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Anxiety symptoms appear to be the primary concern, with frequent panic attacks, avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, and a pervasive sense of nervousness and fear. Depressive symptoms are also present, characterized by decreased interest in activities and feelings of hopelessness. The patient's reports of physical symptoms, both during and outside of panic attacks, suggest potential somatic symptom concerns. Suicidal ideation was endorsed, but without intent. Overall, the patient's symptoms suggest a complex clinical presentation, potentially involving anxiety and depressive disorders, and warrant further evaluation and treatment.",

You mentioned feeling like you're stuck in a rut and can't get out, and that you're constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. I'm here to support you, and I want to acknowledge the courage it takes to share these struggles.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> with <med>Co-Occurring Depressive Symptoms</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med>, characterized by recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>anxiety</sym>, and avoidance of situations that may trigger attacks. The patient's reports of <sym>physical symptoms</sym> during attacks, such as a racing heart, sweating, and chest pains, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, suggest co-occurring <med>depressive symptoms</med>. The patient's <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>physical symptoms</sym> also warrant consideration.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n3. Development of a <quote>panic attack coping plan</quote> to help manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and reduce avoidance behaviors.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n5. Consideration of <med>somatic symptom disorder</med> as a potential co-occurring diagnosis, given the patient's reports of <sym>unexplained physical symptoms</sym>.",
