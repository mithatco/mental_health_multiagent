This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll do my best to make this process as comfortable as possible for you. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling like you're \"just going through the motions\" and not really enjoying social gatherings or parties because of your discomfort with big crowds. <quote>I'm not really into big crowds</quote>. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life and causing you significant distress. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>, including excessive and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. This fear leads to <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, such as avoiding parties and big meetings, and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> like feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge. The patient's physical symptoms, such as blushing, sweating, and a shaky voice, also support this diagnosis. While the patient reports some depressive symptoms, they appear to be secondary to their social anxiety concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>negative thought patterns</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> associated with social anxiety.\n2. Exposure therapy to gradually help the patient become comfortable in social situations and reduce <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3. Mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. Consideration of <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med> for symptom management, if deemed necessary.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.",
