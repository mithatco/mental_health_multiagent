      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with feelings of anxiety and nervousness, particularly in social situations. You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying social gatherings or parties, but you do appreciate spending time with close friends and family. You also shared that you experience intrusive thoughts, such as worries about saying something stupid or being judged, and that you've been having trouble sleeping due to stress and anxiety about social interactions. It's clear that these feelings are impacting your daily life and relationships. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>nervousness</sym> in social situations, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder</med>. This condition is characterized by persistent difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, leading to impairments in social relationships and daily functioning. The patient's reports of feeling like they're \"just going through the motions\" and struggling to form close relationships also support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> symptoms and improve communication skills.\n2. Exploration of coping mechanisms and strategies to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and improve <sym>sleep quality</sym>.\n3. Consideration of <med>acceptance and commitment therapy</med> (<med>ACT</med>) to help the patient develop psychological flexibility and values-based action.\n4. Referral to a support group or online resources for individuals with <med>social anxiety disorder</med> to provide additional support and connection.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress, adjust treatment plan as needed, and address any emerging concerns.",
