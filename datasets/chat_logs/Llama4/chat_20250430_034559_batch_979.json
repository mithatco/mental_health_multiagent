This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'hearing things' and 'voices,' the therapist inquired further into these symptoms, which aligns with the DSM-5 criteria for psychotic symptoms.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were minor inaccuracies or vague phrasing in a few instances. For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specifically inquired about the patient's energy levels during those times to better assess mania symptoms. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and targeted the patient's symptoms effectively.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's reports of suicidal ideation and hallucinations. The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression, demonstrating a high level of consistency.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Somatic Symptom Disorder and Psychotic Disorder generally align with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, there was a minor ambiguity in justifying why certain alternative diagnoses were not considered, such as Major Depressive Disorder, which could also explain some of the patient's symptoms.",
