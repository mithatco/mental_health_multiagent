Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment is a tool to help identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. It consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one by one. Please feel free to express yourself in as much detail as you like. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You mentioned feeling overwhelmed, and it's hard to find joy in things you used to enjoy. <quote>I've been feeling really down about things I used to enjoy. It's like nothing seems as fun or interesting as it did before. I just feel so overwhelmed with everything that's been going on.</quote> Your sleep has been impacted, and you're experiencing physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches.
