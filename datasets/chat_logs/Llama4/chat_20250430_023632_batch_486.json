          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a primary concern being recurrent panic attacks. These attacks are characterized by intense fear, physical symptoms (e.g., aches and pains), and a persistent worry about having future attacks. The patient also expresses feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and disconnection from previously enjoyed activities.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic:** The patient consistently reports high levels of anxiety, frequent panic attacks, and a pervasive fear of future attacks. This anxiety leads to avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding crowded places, public transportation).\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Feelings of hopelessness, disconnection from things they used to enjoy, irritability, and a general disinterest in activities are noted.\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** The patient experiences significant sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep due to constant vigilance for panic attack symptoms.\n- **Impact on Daily Life:** Anxiety and fear of panic attacks have led to social withdrawal, avoidance of previously enjoyed activities, and difficulties in relationships.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms suggest the presence of an anxiety disorder, potentially panic disorder with agoraphobia given the avoidance of situations due to fear of panic attacks.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** Although not as prominently featured, symptoms of depression (e.g., loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness) are present and may indicate a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n- **Sleep Disorder:** Sleep disturbances could be indicative of an insomnia disorder or a sleep disorder related to another mental health condition.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** While the patient denies thoughts of hurting themselves, the presence of significant depressive symptoms and hopelessness warrants continued monitoring for suicidal ideation.\n- **Substance Use:** The patient denies using substances to cope, but the desire to find something to help relax or sleep could indicate a risk for future substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms consistent with panic disorder, possibly with agoraphobia, and co-occurring depressive symptoms. Anxiety symptoms are pervasive, affecting daily functioning, sleep, and interpersonal relationships. The patient experiences panic attacks characterized by intense fear and physical symptoms, leading to significant avoidance behaviors. Depressive symptoms include decreased interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and irritability. Sleep disturbances are also a significant concern, impacting overall well-being.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Panic Disorder (300.21)\n- Agoraphobia (300.22)\n- Major Depressive Disorder (296.32)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02)\n- Insomnia Disorder (780.52)\n\n**Clinical Recommendations:**\n- Further evaluation to confirm diagnoses.\n- Development of a treatment plan addressing panic disorder, potential depressive disorder, and sleep disturbances.\n- Consideration of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy.\n- Close monitoring for suicidal ideation and substance use.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're experiencing a lot of distress with <sym>panic attacks</sym> that are really impacting your daily life. You mentioned feeling like you're constantly on edge, worried about when the next attack will happen, and it's hard for you to enjoy things you used to like because of this fear. You also shared feeling <sym>hopeless</sym> and <sym>irritable</sym>, and it's affecting your relationships and sleep. It's clear that these symptoms are causing you a lot of <quote>stress and anxiety</quote> and making it hard for you to feel like yourself.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym> and persistent concern about having future attacks. The presence of <sym>agoraphobia</sym> is suggested by the patient's avoidance of situations (e.g., crowded places, public transportation) due to fear of having a panic attack. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> such as <sym>hopelessness</sym> and decreased interest in activities suggest a possible co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med>, but the primary clinical concern appears to be the panic disorder with agoraphobia.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further assess and refine the diagnosis, particularly to evaluate for co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med>.\n2. Consider referring the patient to a therapist for <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, which is effective for <med>panic disorder</med> and <med>agoraphobia</med>.\n3. Explore <med>pharmacotherapy</med> options, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can be effective for both <med>panic disorder</med> and <med>depressive disorders</med>.\n4. Provide the patient with educational materials and resources on managing <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>, as well as coping strategies for <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>panic attack diary</quote> to track when attacks occur, potential triggers, and the effectiveness of coping strategies.",
