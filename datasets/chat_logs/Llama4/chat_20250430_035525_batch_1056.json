You've described feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a sense of a cloud over you that makes it hard to see a positive future. You've also been experiencing anxiety, feeling on edge, and having trouble sleeping. It's clear that you're struggling with <sym>memory problems</sym> and feeling physically drained. Your responses suggest that you're having a tough time managing your emotions and feeling connected to others. <quote>\"Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here\"</quote> suggests that you're experiencing some suicidal thoughts, which is really concerning.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. Your reported <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>irritability</sym> may also be indicative of co-occurring <med>anxiety disorders</med>, but the primary symptoms appear to be related to depression. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> increases the urgency of this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a more comprehensive diagnostic interview to confirm the presence of symptoms and rule out other potential diagnoses.\n2. Develop a safety plan to address <sym>suicidal ideation</sym>, including emergency contact numbers and a crisis plan.\n3. Consider initiating treatment with <med>antidepressant medication</med> and/or <med>psychotherapy</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them joy and help them feel connected to others, such as social support groups or hobbies.\n5. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
