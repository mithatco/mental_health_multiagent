Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your experiences over the past two weeks. This assessment is confidential and will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's take a deep breath and begin when you're ready. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You described feeling like you're just going through the motions, and that's really tough to deal with. It's clear that you're experiencing a lot of distress, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you. <quote>I've been feeling pretty disconnected from things I used to enjoy. It's like I'm just going through the motions, you know? I don't really feel like doing much of anything anymore.</quote> It takes a lot of courage to share this, and I appreciate your trust in me.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms suggest a strong link to a traumatic event, with <sym>flashbacks</sym> and <sym>intrusive memories</sym> (Q16).

Additionally, the patient's <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14) meet criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) and increased <sym>substance use</sym> (Q21) are concerning and require immediate attention.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to address <med>PTSD</med> symptoms.\n3. Prescribe antidepressant medication or other pharmacological interventions to manage <med>MDD</med> symptoms, such as <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>anhedonia</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to reduce or eliminate substance use and provide resources for <sym>substance use disorder</sym> treatment, if necessary.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms, treatment progress, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
