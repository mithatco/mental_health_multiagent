However, the justification could have been more comprehensive, including a detailed differential diagnosis and explicit links to DSM-5 criteria. The reasoning behind the diagnosis was sound but could have benefited from additional depth.",
        "empathy": "The therapist generally displayed empathy and a natural conversational style, acknowledging the patient's distress and tailoring responses to their emotional state. However, there were minor moments where the therapist's responses seemed slightly impersonal or overly technical. Overall, the interaction was warm and supportive, but could have been even more personalized."

      "overall_comments": "The conversation demonstrated a strong, comprehensive approach to assessing the patient's mental health using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The therapist successfully explored all domains, maintained a logical flow, and displayed empathy. While minor areas for improvement exist, particularly in clinical relevance and diagnostic justification, the overall performance was excellent. With refinement in these areas, the therapist can further enhance their assessment skills and provide even more effective support to patients.",
