Their anxiety symptoms are particularly pronounced in social situations, leading to avoidance behaviors. The patient's reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and lack of motivation, may indicate symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the presence of Anxiety Disorders, Sleep-Wake Disorders, or other conditions. The patient's substance use habits and coping mechanisms should also be explored in more depth. Overall, the patient's symptoms suggest a need for comprehensive assessment and potential treatment to address their mental health concerns.",
