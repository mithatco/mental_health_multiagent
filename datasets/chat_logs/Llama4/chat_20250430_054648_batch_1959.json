This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to be as open as possible. Let's begin with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

These symptoms have significantly impacted daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. The clinical presentation suggests the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, potentially including assessments for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and somatic symptom disorder. Additionally, careful assessment of suicidal ideation and substance use is warranted. A treatment plan addressing these multifaceted symptoms and concerns is necessary to improve the patient's functioning and quality of life.",
