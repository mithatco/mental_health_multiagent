This questionnaire is designed to understand various aspects of your mental health across different areas. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
