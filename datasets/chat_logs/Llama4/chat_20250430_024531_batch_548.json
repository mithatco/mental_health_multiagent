The assessment I'm using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Their symptoms suggest potential diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders, possibly with obsessive-compulsive features. The patient's avoidance behaviors, self-blame, and guilt may contribute to their distress and impairment. The clinician should consider a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to determine the underlying causes of the patient's symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.",
