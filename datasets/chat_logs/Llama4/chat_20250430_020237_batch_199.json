They report significant distress and impairment in daily life, including social disconnection and avoidance behaviors. The patient's responses indicate a high level of symptomatology, with potential implications for diagnoses such as MDD, Anxiety Disorder, and Psychotic Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation and substance use requires immediate attention and safety planning. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the patient's specific diagnoses and develop an effective treatment plan.",

While there were minor areas for improvement, such as more precise language in some questions and deeper emotional validation, the therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided clear diagnostic justification. Overall, this was a strong performance with only minor issues.",
