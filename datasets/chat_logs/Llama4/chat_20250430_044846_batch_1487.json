I'm going to use the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult questionnaire to help us understand how you're feeling. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be concerning and could impact your treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential. I want to assure you that this is a safe space for you to express yourself. Over the next session, I'll be asking you 23 questions. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you like. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You've described it like a <quote>cloud following you around</quote>, and it's affecting your daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. It's clear that you're finding it hard to cope with these feelings and are seeking support.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with anxious distress\n\n**Reasoning:** Your symptoms of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>irritability</sym>, and <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> are consistent with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, such as feeling on edge and worried, suggests anxious distress, which is a common specifier for MDD. Your <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> may also be related to your depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Psychotherapy:** Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med> to address your depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n2. **Pharmacological interventions:** We may consider <med>antidepressant medication</med> to help manage your symptoms, but this would require careful consideration and monitoring.\n3. **Lifestyle modifications:** Engage in <sym>stress-reducing activities</sym> like exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques to help manage your anxiety and depressive symptoms.\n4. **Regular follow-up:** Schedule regular appointments to monitor your symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
