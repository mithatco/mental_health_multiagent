You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions, with little interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym>. You've also been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless <sym>depressed</sym>, and it's been tough to shake off these feelings. Your sleep has been affected, and you're experiencing <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, which can be really frustrating. You're also dealing with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and images related to the accident, and it's impacting your daily life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</med>, <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms and experiences suggest a diagnosis of <med>PTSD</med> due to the presence of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym>, <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>, and <sym>hypervigilance</sym> related to the traumatic event (the accident). Additionally, the patient's report of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>, meets the criteria for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's use of alcohol to cope with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> may indicate a risk for <med>substance use disorder</med>, but it's not clear if this meets the full criteria.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>PTSD</med> and <med>MDD</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and <med>trauma-focused CBT</med> to address the patient's <sym>PTSD symptoms</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, to help manage the patient's <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>sleep diary</sym> to monitor their <sym>sleep patterns</sym> and identify potential triggers for <sym>insomnia</sym>.\n5. Offer <med>substance use disorder</med> counseling to address the patient's use of alcohol as a coping mechanism for <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.",
