I'll ask each one in turn, and you can respond as naturally as possible. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

It's clear that you're dealing with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> that are distressing and interfere with your well-being. Your <quote>\"feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\"</quote> and <quote>\"being on edge all the time\"</quote> suggest a significant emotional burden.

The <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (Q1, Q2) and <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6, Q7) suggest co-occurring <med>MDD</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) indicates a need for immediate risk assessment and safety planning.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Initiate <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med>, specifically <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. Develop a <med>depression</med> and <med>anxiety</med> management plan, potentially incorporating <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med>.\n3. Conduct regular <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> assessments and establish a crisis plan.\n4. Encourage <med>sleep hygiene</med> practices to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5.
