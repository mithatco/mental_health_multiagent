You described a constant cloud of <sym>sadness</sym> and <sym>worry</sym> that you can't shake, and it's affecting your relationships and daily functioning. You feel like you're on edge all the time, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it's terrifying. Your <sym>sleep</sym> is terrible, and you lie awake at night worrying about everything.

The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, avoidance behaviors, and emotional distress. The <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>somatic symptoms</sym> also support this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym>.\n2.
