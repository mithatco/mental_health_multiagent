The assessment we're about to do is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult.

Everything discussed here is confidential, and I'm here to create a safe space for you to share your thoughts and feelings. We'll go through 23 questions together, and I'll ask one question at a time. Let's start with the first question. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
