You feel like you're just going through the motions, and it's hard to enjoy things because you're always concerned about something going wrong. <quote>it's like, I know I have a good life, but I just can't shake off the feeling that something's going to go wrong</quote>. Your anxiety affects your relationships, making you feel distant from others, and it's impacting your ability to sleep and enjoy activities you used to love, like hiking. You also experience physical symptoms like tension in your back and shoulders, and sometimes stomachaches, which are clearly linked to your stress levels. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and seeking help.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>, as evidenced by pervasive worry, feelings of being \"on edge,\" and <sym>irritability</sym>. The presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and <sym>hopelessness</sym> also suggest a <med>Depressive Disorder</med>. The combination of these symptoms, along with <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and physical complaints, points towards these diagnoses. The <sym>panic-like symptoms</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further support the consideration of anxiety disorders.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: This form of therapy can help you address your negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety and depression.\n2. **Medication**: Consider consulting a psychiatrist about potential medication options, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>SNRI</med>, which can help manage symptoms of both anxiety and depression.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene Practices**: Implement strategies to improve sleep quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and electronics before bedtime.\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Continue exploring mindfulness apps and consider adding practices like meditation or yoga to help manage stress and anxiety.\n5. **Regular Follow-Up**: Schedule regular check-ins with a mental health professional to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
