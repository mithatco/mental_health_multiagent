You mentioned having <sym>little interest or pleasure in doing things</sym> and feeling like you're just going through the motions. Your <quote>\"cloud of sadness\"</quote> that follows you around sounds incredibly difficult to manage.

The presence of <sym>anxious distress</sym> (Q6, Q7) and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> (Q8) further supports this diagnosis. Your reports of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>compulsive behaviors</sym> (Q17) may also indicate co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1.

Develop a <med>self-care plan</med> to improve sleep quality, increase engagement in pleasurable activities, and enhance overall well-being.\n5. Provide <med>crisis intervention</med> and <med>suicidal prevention</med> resources, given the patient's reports of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11).",
