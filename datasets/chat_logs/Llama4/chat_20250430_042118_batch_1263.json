      "predicted": "I've heard that you've been struggling with feelings of hopelessness, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym> that seem overwhelming. You mentioned feeling like there's a cloud over everything and that it's hard to shake off. It's clear that these feelings are affecting your daily life, making it difficult to find joy in things you used to enjoy and causing you to feel disconnected from others. Your experiences, such as hearing voices and feeling like others can sense your thoughts, must be incredibly distressing. It's understandable that you'd feel lost and unsure about your future. I'm here to support you, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Schizophrenia</med> \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Schizophrenia</med>, including <sym>delusions</sym> (feeling like others can hear thoughts), <sym>hallucinations</sym> (hearing voices), <sym>disorganized thinking</sym> (difficulty concentrating, memory issues), and significant <sym>negative symptoms</sym> (lack of interest in activities, social withdrawal). The duration and impact of these symptoms suggest a severe mental health condition that requires comprehensive evaluation and treatment.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation:** A thorough assessment by a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. **Psychotherapy:** Engage in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or another evidence-based therapy to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxious</sym> symptoms.\n3. **Medication Management:** Explore <med>antipsychotic medications</med> and <med>antidepressants</med> to help manage <sym>hallucinations</sym>, <sym>delusions</sym>, <sym>depression</sym>, and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n4. **Support Groups:** Encourage participation in support groups for individuals with <med>schizophrenia</med> and their families to build a support network.\n5. **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Consider cognitive training programs to improve memory and cognitive function.\n6. **Substance Use Counseling:** Address potential <med>substance use</med> issues through counseling or support groups to prevent exacerbation of symptoms.",
