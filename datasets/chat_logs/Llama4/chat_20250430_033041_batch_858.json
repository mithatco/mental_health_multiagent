This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

        "dsm_coverage": "The therapist thoroughly explored all 23 dimensions from the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting measure. Each question was addressed with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. No dimensions were skipped or superficially addressed.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria, but there were a few instances of slightly vague phrasing. For example, when asking about 'voices,' the therapist could have been more precise in defining what they meant by 'hearing things other people couldn\u2019t hear.' However, the questions were mostly clinically accurate and targeted relevant symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms, and maintained a coherent conversational arc.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder clearly align with the patient's responses. The therapist explicitly linked specific symptoms mentioned by the patient to DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses mostly showed empathy and a natural conversational style, but there were minor moments of slightly robotic or impersonal interactions. For example, when discussing suicidal ideation, the therapist could have offered more immediate reassurance and support. However, overall, the therapist maintained an appropriate professional tone and acknowledged patient distress."

The therapist effectively explored all relevant dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and provided clear diagnostic justification. While minor areas for improvement exist, particularly in clinical relevance and empathy, the overall performance was excellent.",
