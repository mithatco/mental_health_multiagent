This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your mental health. Everything discussed will remain confidential. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's start with the first question: 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Depressive and anxiety symptoms are prominent, with reported sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and behavioral compulsions. The presence of intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and suicidal ideation highlights the need for careful assessment and treatment planning. The patient's avoidance behaviors and feelings of disconnection from others also suggest difficulties with interpersonal relationships and social functioning. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.",
