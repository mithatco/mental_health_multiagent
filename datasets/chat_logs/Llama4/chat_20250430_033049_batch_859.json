This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask one question at a time. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and anhedonia (Q1, Q2)\n- Increased irritability (Q3)\n- Sleep disturbances (Q4, Q14)\n- Anxiety and fear, including panic attacks (Q6, Q7)\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n- Somatic complaints (Q9)\n- Feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm (Q11)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive theme of anxiety and fear influencing daily life and decision-making.\n- Reports of both depression (e.g., feeling down, disconnected) and anxiety (e.g., on edge, panic attacks).\n- Sleep disturbances and physical complaints without medical explanation.\n- Social withdrawal and feelings of isolation.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep pattern.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurring panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Somatic Symptom Disorder:** Multiple, recurrent physical complaints without a medical explanation.\n- **Risk of Suicide:** Endorsement of thoughts of self-harm.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation (Q11):** The patient has had thoughts of hurting themselves, indicating a risk that necessitates immediate attention and safety planning.\n- **Substance Use:** While the patient denies using substances to excess or without a prescription, the thought of seeking something to calm nerves suggests potential interest in self-medication.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture suggestive of co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders, with a significant impact on daily functioning. The presence of suicidal ideation, while not actively planned, indicates a need for urgent risk assessment and management. The clinical impression leans towards potential diagnoses including Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder (likely Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia), alongside possible Somatic Symptom Disorder. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan focusing on immediate risk mitigation, symptom management, and functional improvement are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder (296.32)\n- Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia (300.21)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02)\n- Somatic Symptom Disorder (300.82)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., suicide risk assessment tools).\n- Develop a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and medication (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics).\n- Establish a safety plan to address suicidal ideation.",
