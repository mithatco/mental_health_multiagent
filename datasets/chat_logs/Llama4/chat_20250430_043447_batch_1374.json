The therapist ensured that no domain was skipped or superficially covered, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specified 'in the past two weeks' to align more closely with the DSM-5 timeframe. However, overall, the questions were clinically relevant and accurately targeted.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's thoughts of hurting themselves and substance use. The conversation maintained a coherent and logical progression throughout.",

However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by explicitly ruling out other potential diagnoses, such as Bipolar Disorder, given the patient's report of impulsive behaviors and mood swings.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, used appropriate tone, and tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For example, when the patient discussed feeling hopeless, the therapist empathized and offered support, demonstrating a warm and personalized interaction."

The therapist successfully covered all DSM-5 dimensions, maintained a logical flow, and showed consistent empathy.

With some refinement in clinical phrasing and diagnostic reasoning, this conversation could be considered exceptional.",
