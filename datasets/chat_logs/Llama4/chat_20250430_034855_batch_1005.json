The therapist ensured that no dimension was skipped or superficially addressed, demonstrating a comprehensive assessment.",

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual but still having a lot of energy,' the therapist could have been more precise in defining 'a lot of energy.' Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have benefited from more precise language.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flows logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist effectively followed up on concerning disclosures, such as suicidal ideation and substance use, and ensured that the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",

The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing differential diagnoses and ruling out other potential conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses consistently showed empathy, a natural conversational style, and an appropriate professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, validated their emotions, and tailored responses to their emotional state. The interaction felt warm, personalized, and supportive throughout."
