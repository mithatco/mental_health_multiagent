You mentioned feeling down and hopeless sometimes, especially when you think about how you struggle in social situations. You wish you could be more confident and outgoing, but it feels like that's just not you. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms of <sym>social anxiety</sym>, avoidance of social situations, and fear of judgment in social situations meet potential criteria for <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's reports of physical symptoms, such as headaches and nausea, and recurring thoughts about social interactions, suggest a high level of distress. The patient's feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty about their identity in social situations may indicate a potential <med>depressive disorder</med>, but the symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (<med>CBT</med>) to address <sym>social anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n2. Consideration of <med>acceptance and commitment therapy</med> (<med>ACT</med>) to help the patient develop coping skills and increase self-acceptance.\n3. Development of a <med>self-care plan</med> to help the patient manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym> in social situations.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.",
