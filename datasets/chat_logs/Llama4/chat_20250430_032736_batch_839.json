The conversation could have benefited from more comprehensive exploration of these areas.",

However, some questions were phrased vaguely or lacked specificity, which might have led to minor inaccuracies. For example, the therapist asked about 'sleep disturbances' (question 14) without directly referencing the DSM-5 criteria for sleep problems. Overall, the questions were clinically relevant but could have been more precise.",
        "consistency": "The conversation flowed logically, with each question building on previous responses. The therapist followed up on concerning disclosures, such as the patient's reports of feeling down and irritated. However, there were a few instances where the conversation jumped abruptly between topics, and some areas (e.g., substance use) were not explored in sufficient depth. Overall, the dialogue was coherent, but minor inconsistencies existed.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The therapist provided a clear diagnosis of PTSD or Anxiety Disorder and Depressive Disorder, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. The reasoning behind the diagnostic decision was explicitly stated and generally aligned with DSM-5 criteria. However, the therapist could have considered alternative diagnoses and provided more detailed differential diagnosis consideration. The diagnostic justification was sound but could have been more comprehensive.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style, tailoring responses to the patient's emotional state. They acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their experiences, creating a supportive and non-judgmental atmosphere. The therapist's tone was professional, and their language was warm and personalized, making the patient feel heard and understood."
