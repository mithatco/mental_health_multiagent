This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed is confidential and a safe space for you to share your experiences.

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Depressed mood and loss of interest in activities\n- Anxiety and panic attacks\n- Irritability and increased frustration\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Physical symptoms (aches and pains, racing heart, stomachaches)\n- Cognitive difficulties (memory issues, intrusive thoughts)\n- Feelings of detachment and questioning of identity\n- Social withdrawal\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive theme of anxiety and fear underlies many of the patient's responses, often linked to panic attacks and their anticipation.\n- Significant distress and impairment across various domains, including mood, anxiety, sleep, and social relationships.\n- Physical symptoms are common, with no clear medical explanation.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness.\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having attacks, and avoidance behaviors.\n- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):** Excessive anxiety and worry about everyday things, difficulty controlling worry.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTD):** Although not directly indicated, feelings of detachment and questioning identity might suggest trauma, which warrants further exploration.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports occasional thoughts of hurting themselves during panic attacks, indicating a need for immediate risk assessment and management.\n- **Social Isolation:** Withdrawal from social interactions due to anxiety and fear of panic attacks.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation characterized by co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a significant impact on daily functioning. Key features include persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, recurrent panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, sleep disturbances, and physical complaints without a clear medical cause. The presence of suicidal ideation, albeit passive, necessitates careful risk assessment. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, with possible comorbid conditions. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of a treatment plan that addresses both the depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as the suicidal ideation, are warranted. \n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Anxiety Disorder (Panic Disorder with or without Agoraphobia)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Potential trauma-related disorders (PTSD) for further exploration\n\n**Treatment Recommendations:**\n- In-depth diagnostic evaluation\n- Development of a treatment plan focusing on symptom management, coping strategies, and possible psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., CBT, DBT)\n- Assessment and management of suicidal risk\n- Consideration of pharmacological interventions to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.",

You mentioned feeling like you're walking on eggshells, waiting for the next attack, and it's affecting your daily life and relationships. <quote>\"It's like this cloud of sadness following me around, and I don't know how to shake it off.\"</quote> It sounds incredibly challenging and isolating. Your feelings are valid, and it's clear that you're struggling to cope with these symptoms.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> (specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> due to the reported <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym>, changes in <sym>sleep patterns</sym>, and <sym>feelings of hopelessness</sym>. The presence of recurrent <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>persistent worry about having attacks</sym>, and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> supports a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>, specifically <med>Panic Disorder</med>. The <sym>physical symptoms</sym> without a clear medical cause, such as <sym>racing heart</sym> and <sym>stomachaches</sym>, further support these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the presence of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Panic Disorder</med>.\n2. Develop a treatment plan focusing on symptom management, coping strategies, and possible psychotherapeutic interventions such as <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</med>.\n3. Assess and manage <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> through regular check-ins and safety planning.\n4. Consider pharmacological interventions, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, under the guidance of a psychiatrist.\n5. Encourage the patient to keep a <sym>symptom journal</sym> to track <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>mood</sym> changes, aiding in treatment planning and monitoring.",
