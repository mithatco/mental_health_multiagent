The only potential area for improvement could be in probing slightly deeper into certain areas, such as substance use history, but overall, coverage was comprehensive.",

The language used was clinically precise, and questions were phrased to elicit specific information relevant to the DSM-5 domains. For instance, when assessing for anxiety, the therapist asked about feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, which directly aligns with DSM-5 criteria for anxiety disorders.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, seamlessly transitioning between topics based on the patient's disclosures. For example, after the patient mentioned panic attacks, the therapist logically followed up with questions about avoiding situations that make them anxious, demonstrating a smooth and coherent progression.",
