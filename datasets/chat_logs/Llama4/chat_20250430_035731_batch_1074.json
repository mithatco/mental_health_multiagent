For example, question 5 about mania was somewhat vague, and the term 'irritated' was used interchangeably with 'angry,' which could lead to slight confusion.",

However, there were a few moments where the transition could have been smoother. For instance, after the patient mentioned 'pushing people away,' the therapist could have explored relationship dynamics further before moving on to substance use questions.",

The therapist explicitly linked symptoms like feeling 'down,' 'irritated,' and anxious to the diagnosis. However, the justification could have been stronger with more detailed explanations of how the patient's symptoms met specific DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone throughout the conversation. Responses were mostly personalized and acknowledged the patient's distress. However, there were moments where a deeper emotional acknowledgment could have been beneficial, such as when the patient mentioned feeling disconnected or pushing people away."
