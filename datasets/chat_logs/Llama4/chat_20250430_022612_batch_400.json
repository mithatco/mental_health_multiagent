You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless <sym>depressed mood</sym>, and that these feelings are affecting your daily life.

Your concerns about sleep disturbances <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, anxiety <sym>anxiety</sym>, and cognitive difficulties <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> are also valid and important to address.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pervasive pattern of depressive symptoms, including <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>lack of interest</sym> in activities. The presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> is a significant concern, although the patient denies any current plans. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as outlined in the DSM-5. The co-occurring anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic interview to further assess symptoms and concerns.\n2. Administer additional assessments to better understand the patient's risk profile, including suicidal ideation and behavior questionnaires.\n3. Develop a treatment plan to address depressive symptoms, including <med>pharmacological interventions</med> (e.g., antidepressants) and <med>psychotherapeutic interventions</med> (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy).\n4. Address sleep disturbances through <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> and potentially <med>sleep aids</med>.\n5. Provide education on stress management and coping skills to help the patient manage anxiety symptoms.\n6. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
