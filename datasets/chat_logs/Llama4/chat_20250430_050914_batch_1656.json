          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns:\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety and depression. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Anxiety and Panic Attacks:** The patient experiences frequent panic attacks, intense fear, and anxiety, often feeling \"on edge\" (Q6, Q7).\n- **Depressive Symptoms:** Reports feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, with a lack of interest or pleasure in activities (Q2, Q1).\n- **Sleep Disturbances:** Trouble sleeping due to anxiety and worry about panic attacks (Q4, Q14).\n- **Avoidance Behaviors:** Avoids situations that may trigger anxiety, such as crowded places or public transport (Q8).\n\n### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:\n\n- **Anxiety and Depression:** The patient\u2019s responses suggest a significant overlap of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Anxiety seems to be a predominant feature, with depressive symptoms likely exacerbated by the chronic nature of the anxiety.\n- **Somatic Symptoms:** Physical symptoms during panic attacks, such as chest pain and shortness of breath, alongside general aches and pains (Q9).\n- **Social Withdrawal:** The patient is withdrawing from social interactions due to embarrassment about their anxiety (Q20).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Symptoms align with a potential diagnosis of a panic disorder and possibly a generalized anxiety disorder given the persistent worry and anxiety.\n- **Depressive Disorder:** The presence of sustained feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities could indicate a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):** Although not directly indicated, the avoidance behaviors and intense fear during panic attacks might suggest elements of PTSD, which warrants further exploration.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:\n\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient expresses a desire to feel normal again and is scared about their situation but does not report active suicidal thoughts (Q11).\n- **Substance Use:** Denies using substances to cope, though mentions a desire for something to make the anxiety go away (Q21, Q22, Q23).\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations:\n\nThe patient presents with **predominant symptoms of anxiety**, including panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors, alongside **co-occurring depressive symptoms**. Significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning are evident. The clinical picture suggests potential diagnoses of panic disorder and possibly major depressive disorder. **Risk factors include** social withdrawal, substance use desire (without current use), and passive suicidal ideation. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan focusing on anxiety and depressive symptoms is warranted.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Panic Disorder (300.21)\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02)\n- Major Depressive Disorder (296.32)\n- Potential PTSD (309.81) \n\n**Recommendation:** A detailed clinical interview, further diagnostic assessment, and possible referral for a mental health specialist for therapy (e.g., CBT) and consideration of pharmacotherapy to manage symptoms.",

      "predicted": "I've heard that you're struggling with overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression, making it hard to find joy in things you used to enjoy. You feel like you're just going through the motions. Your anxiety is constant, and you're worried about having panic attacks, which has led you to avoid certain situations. You also mentioned feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and frustrated with yourself for not being able to handle things better. It's clear that this is taking a toll on your daily life and relationships.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Panic Disorder</med> due to the presence of recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having attacks, and avoidance behaviors (Q6, Q7, Q8). Additionally, the patient's reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, and a lack of interest in activities, suggest co-occurring <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> (Q2, Q1). The <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> are impacting daily functioning, and it's essential to address both.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any other potential conditions.\n2. <med>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</med> to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Possible referral for <med>pharmacotherapy</med> to manage symptoms, such as <med>antidepressants</med> or <med>anxiolytics</med>.\n4. Encourage the patient to keep a <quote>symptom journal</quote> to track <sym>panic attacks</sym> and <sym>mood changes</sym>, which can help identify triggers and patterns.\n5. Develop a <quote>crisis plan</quote> to ensure the patient has a support system in place during <sym>panic attacks</sym> or times of increased <sym>distress</sym>.",
