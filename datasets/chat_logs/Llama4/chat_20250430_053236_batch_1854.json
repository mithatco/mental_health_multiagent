The questionnaire I'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment will help us understand your mental health across various domains. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you 23 questions, and I encourage you to respond as honestly as possible. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
