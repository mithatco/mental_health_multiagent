You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and that nothing excites you anymore. It's like you're stuck in a rut and can't seem to get out of it. You also shared that you're feeling <sym>anxious</sym> and on edge a lot, worrying about the future and how to cope with all the changes in your life. These feelings are affecting your relationships and daily life, making it hard for you to connect with others and find motivation.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses indicate a pattern of <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>, including <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities, <sym>feelings of sadness</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>changes in sleep patterns</sym>. Additionally, they report experiencing <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic</sym>, which are impacting their daily life and relationships. The combination of these symptoms, along with the patient's report of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (although without a plan), suggests a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>. The patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for these conditions, and a comprehensive treatment plan should be developed to address these concerns.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A thorough diagnostic evaluation by a mental health professional to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> and/or <med>medication</med> to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Encourage the patient to engage in activities that bring them joy and help them connect with others, such as <quote>hobbies or social events</quote>.\n4. Consider <med>sleep hygiene practices</med> to help improve sleep quality.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor treatment progress and adjust the plan as needed.",
