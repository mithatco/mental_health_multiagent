The assessment we're about to do is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us understand various aspects of your mental health. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's reports of panic attacks, avoidance behaviors, and excessive anxiety suggest an anxiety disorder, while depressive symptoms and changes in sleep patterns may indicate Major Depressive Disorder. The presence of suicidal ideation and lack of interest in activities require careful assessment and intervention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan are necessary to address the patient's symptoms and concerns.",
