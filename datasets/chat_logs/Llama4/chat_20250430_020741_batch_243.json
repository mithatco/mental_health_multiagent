It's like I'm going through the motions.</quote> It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it's affecting your daily life. You mentioned feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, and it's hard for you to shake off the feeling of a weight being on you all the time. <quote>Yeah, I've been feeling down a lot lately. It's hard to explain, but it feels like a weight is on me all the time. Sometimes I wonder if things will ever get better.</quote> I'm here to support you, and I want to help you explore these feelings and work towards finding ways to improve your mental health.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms, such as <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> (Q4, Q14), and <sym>fatigue</sym> (Q4), align with the diagnostic criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>. The patient's reports of <sym>irritability</sym> (Q3), <sym>anxiety</sym> (Q6), and <sym>cognitive difficulties</sym> (Q15, Q16) also support this diagnosis. Although the patient denies <sym>suicidal intent</sym> (Q11), the presence of <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> warrants close monitoring and consideration in the treatment plan.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychological history, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Development of a treatment plan that incorporates <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to address depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n3. Consideration of <med>pharmacological interventions</med>, such as <med>antidepressants</med>, to help manage depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and anxiety.\n4. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor symptoms, adjust the treatment plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.\n5. Encouragement of self-care activities, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage stress and improve overall well-being.",
