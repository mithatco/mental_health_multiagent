          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and related psychosocial impairments. Primary concerns include:\n\n- **Anxiety and worry:** The patient experiences excessive worry about everyday things, feels on edge, and has panic attacks.\n- **Depressive symptoms:** Reports feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, with a lack of interest in activities.\n- **Sleep disturbances:** Difficulty sleeping due to racing thoughts and anxiety.\n- **Physical symptoms:** Unexplained aches and pains, tension in shoulders and neck, stomachaches, and shortness of breath.\n- **Cognitive impairments:** Difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and intrusive thoughts.\n\n### 2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses\n\n- **Anxiety and depression interplay:** The patient's symptoms suggest a strong interplay between anxiety and depressive disorders, with anxiety seemingly predominant.\n- **Avoidance behaviors:** Avoids situations that increase anxiety, leading to social withdrawal.\n- **Self-doubt and low self-esteem:** Expresses feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.\n- **Physical and psychological distress:** Physical symptoms are closely tied to psychological distress, indicating a somatic presentation of anxiety.\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n- **Anxiety Disorder:** Recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry, and avoidance behaviors suggest an anxiety disorder, possibly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or Panic Disorder.\n- **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Depressive symptoms, loss of interest, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in sleep and energy levels.\n- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTD):** Although not directly indicated, the presence of panic attacks and being \"on edge\" could suggest underlying trauma.\n- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Repetitive behaviors (e.g., checking locks) and intrusive thoughts.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n- **Suicidal ideation:** The patient mentions feeling like a burden and sometimes wishes they weren't here anymore, indicating passive suicidal ideation.\n- **Substance use:** Past attempts at self-medication with alcohol and marijuana, which could be a risk factor for substance use disorder.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with a complex clinical picture dominated by symptoms of anxiety and depression. The high levels of worry, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors are significant. Additionally, the patient's reports of feeling detached, having a poor self-image, and experiencing cognitive impairments highlight the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. The presence of suicidal ideation, although passive, requires careful assessment and management. The clinical presentation suggests the need for further evaluation to determine the most appropriate diagnoses and to develop an effective treatment plan.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Anxiety Disorders (GAD, Panic Disorder)\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n- Potential PTSD if trauma history is present\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a detailed diagnostic interview.\n- Consider trauma-informed assessments.\n- Evaluate for substance use disorders.\n- Develop a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and possible pharmacological interventions.",
