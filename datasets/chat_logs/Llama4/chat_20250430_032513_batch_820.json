This tool helps us identify areas that might be impacting your well-being and treatment. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

You described feeling disconnected from things you used to enjoy, and experiencing a constant cloud of sadness and hopelessness that's hard to shake off. You also shared that you're easily irritated, have trouble sleeping due to racing thoughts, and experience panic attacks that feel terrifying. Additionally, you're dealing with physical aches and pains, and feeling like you're not being taken seriously by others. These experiences sound incredibly challenging, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you.\n\n**Diagnosis:** \n<med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress, <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, and <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** \nThe patient's symptoms align with a diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> due to the presence of <sym>depressed mood</sym> (Q2), <sym>anhedonia</sym> (Q1), and <sym>hopelessness</sym> (Q2). The co-occurring <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (Q6, Q7, Q8) and <sym>somatic complaints</sym> (Q9) suggest a diagnosis of <med>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</med> and <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>. The patient's <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> (Q16) and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (Q17) may also indicate co-occurring <med>Anxiety Disorder</med> symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:** \n1. A comprehensive diagnostic interview and physical exam to rule out underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to symptoms.\n2. <med>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, and to develop coping strategies.\n3. <med>Pharmacological interventions</med>, such as antidepressants or anxiolytics, may be considered to help manage symptoms.\n4. <med>Sleep hygiene practices</med> and <med>relaxation techniques</med>, such as mindfulness or deep breathing, to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5.
