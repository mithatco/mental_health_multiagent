You mentioned feeling like you're just going through the motions and not really enjoying life as much as you used to. It's like you're constantly on edge, worried about what others think of you. You've also been having trouble sleeping and experiencing <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like aches and pains when you're anxious. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med> (300.23)\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's responses suggest a pattern of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> in social situations, which is consistent with <med>Social Anxiety Disorder</med>. They report feeling <sym>nervous</sym>, <sym>anxious</sym>, and <sym>frightened</sym> in social situations, and they avoid these situations altogether. Additionally, they experience <sym>physical symptoms</sym> like aches and pains when they're anxious. While they don't meet the full criteria for <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, their <sym>depressed mood</sym> and <sym>hopelessness</sym> suggest some depressive symptoms.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>avoidance</sym> behaviors.\n2. Exploration of relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to manage <sym>anxiety</sym> symptoms.\n3. Consideration of medication, such as <med>SSRIs</med> or <med>benzodiazepines</med>, to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depressive</sym> symptoms.\n4. Sleep hygiene practices, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and avoiding screens before bedtime, to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n5. Regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.",
