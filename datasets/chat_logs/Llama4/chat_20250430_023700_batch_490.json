Similarly, the therapist explored substance use and suicidal ideation with sensitivity and care.",

For example, when asking about 'sleeping less than usual,' the therapist could have specifically inquired about the patient's sleep patterns in relation to manic episodes. However, the questions were largely clinically relevant and accurately targeted symptoms.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue generally flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. However, there were a few minor inconsistencies, such as abrupt transitions between topics. For instance, the therapist moved quickly from discussing sleep patterns to inquiring about substance use without fully exploring the patient's sleep issues in depth. Overall, the conversation was coherent and well-structured.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Mood Disorder, Unspecified, was based on the patient's reported symptoms of depressive episodes, anxiety, and mood instability. The therapist provided a clear explanation for the diagnosis, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, the differential diagnosis process could have been more comprehensive, and alternative diagnoses like Bipolar Disorder were not thoroughly ruled out. The justification was sound but could have benefited from additional detail.",
        "empathy": "The therapist demonstrated consistent empathy and a natural conversational style throughout the interaction. The patient's distress was acknowledged and validated, and the therapist tailored responses to the patient's emotional state. For example, when the patient expressed feelings of hopelessness, the therapist offered support and reassurance. The conversation maintained a professional tone while being warm and personalized."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist conducted a comprehensive assessment using the DSM-5 Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. The conversation covered all relevant dimensions, and the therapist demonstrated empathy and a professional tone. While there were minor areas for improvement, such as refining clinical phrasing and providing more detailed differential diagnosis considerations, the overall performance was strong. The diagnosis was well-justified, and recommended next steps were clear and appropriate.",
