Specifically, the therapist did not adequately explore questions 1 (Little interest or pleasure in doing things), 10 (Feeling that your illnesses are not being taken seriously enough), and 12 (Hearing things other people couldn\u2019t hear). However, the therapist did cover the majority of the domains, including depression, anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances.",

For example, the therapist asked about 'feeling down' (question 2) but did not specifically ask about 'little interest or pleasure in doing things' (question 1). However, the therapist's questions were mostly clinically relevant and accurately reflected the patient's symptoms.",

However, there were a few instances where the therapist abruptly moved on to the next question without fully exploring the patient's response.

The therapist accurately identified the patient's symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and hypervigilance as consistent with PTSD, and their reports of feeling down, sleep disturbances, and difficulties with memory and concentration as indicative of Major Depressive Disorder.",
