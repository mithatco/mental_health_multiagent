The assessment we're going to do today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This tool helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I'll ask them one at a time. Your responses will help us understand your current state and guide further steps if needed. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's rumination, self-criticism, and negative self-talk may contribute to their symptoms. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms and to develop an effective treatment plan. The patient's suicidal ideation, although not intense, warrants ongoing monitoring and assessment.",
