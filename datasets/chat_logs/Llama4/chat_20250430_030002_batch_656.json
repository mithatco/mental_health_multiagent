Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current mental health. This assessment consists of 23 questions and will help us identify areas that might need further exploration. I'm here to listen and support you throughout this process. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The questions were clinically relevant and appropriate for assessing the patient's symptoms.",

You're also experiencing a lot of anxiety and irritability, feeling on edge and worried about the future <quote>\"I'm always on edge. I'm worried about everything - my future, my finances, my relationships\"</quote>. Additionally, you're having trouble sleeping, and despite sleeping more, you still feel exhausted. These symptoms are affecting your daily life, making it hard to connect with others and find meaning in life.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med> with anxious distress \n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>, as evidenced by their reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>anhedonia</sym>, <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>, and <sym>fatigue</sym>. The presence of <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>, including <sym>panic</sym> and <sym>worry</sym>, suggests anxious distress, which is a common specifier for <med>MDD</med>. The patient's <sym>irritability</sym> and <sym>avoidance behaviors</sym> further support this diagnosis. While other diagnoses, such as <med>Anxiety Disorders</med> or <med>Somatic Symptom Disorder</med>, may also be considered, the patient's symptoms appear to be most consistent with <med>MDD</med> with anxious distress.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions.\n2. Develop a treatment plan that incorporates <med>pharmacotherapy</med>, such as antidepressant medication, to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n3. Consider <med>psychotherapy</med>, such as <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> or <med>interpersonal therapy (IPT)</med>, to help the patient address underlying issues and develop coping strategies.\n4. Encourage the patient to engage in <med>self-care activities</med>, such as exercise, mindfulness, and social support, to help manage <sym>stress</sym> and <sym>anxiety</sym>.\n5. Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
