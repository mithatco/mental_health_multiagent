It's clear that <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> are affecting your daily life. You mentioned feeling like you're \"stuck on my own thoughts and it's hard to focus on anything else,\" which suggests that <sym>obsessive thoughts</sym> might be a challenge for you. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</med> and <med>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses indicate a pattern of <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> and <sym>repetitive behaviors</sym> (Q16, Q17), which are hallmark symptoms of <med>OCD</med>. Additionally, your reports of feeling <sym>down, depressed, or hopeless</sym> (Q2), <sym>loss of interest</sym> in activities (Q1), and <sym>suicidal ideation</sym> (Q11) suggest a co-occurring diagnosis of <med>MDD</med>. The presence of <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>panic attacks</sym> (Q6, Q7) further supports these diagnoses.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Specifically, <med>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</med> therapy for <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n2. **Pharmacological interventions**: Consider <med>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</med> or <med>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</med> for managing <med>MDD</med> and <med>OCD</med> symptoms.\n3. **Sleep hygiene practices**: Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime, and create a relaxing bedtime routine to address <sym>sleep disturbances</sym>.\n4. **Regular follow-up appointments**: Schedule regular check-ins to monitor symptoms, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing support.",
