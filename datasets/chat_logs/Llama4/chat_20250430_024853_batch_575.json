Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to assess various aspects of your mental health. This is a tool to help identify areas that might need further exploration and support. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n- Overwhelming feelings of anxiety and fear, particularly related to panic attacks.\n- Depressed mood, hopelessness, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.\n- Significant sleep disturbances.\n- Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety.\n- Physical symptoms during panic attacks, including chest pain, heart pounding, and shortness of breath.\n\n**2. Patterns in the Patient's Responses:**\n- A pervasive pattern of anxiety and fear, particularly related to panic attacks and their consequences.\n- Avoidance behaviors that significantly impact daily functioning and social interactions.\n- Emotional distress, including irritability, frustration, and feelings of being a burden to others.\n- Self-doubt and questioning of personal identity and life goals.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n- **Anxiety Disorders:** Symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia, given the panic attacks, fear of having an attack in public, and subsequent avoidance of places and situations.\n- **Depressive Disorders:** The patient's reports of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, along with a decrease in interest in activities, may indicate a co-occurring depressive disorder.\n- **Sleep-Wake Disorders:** Significant sleep disturbances, including excessive sleep or poor quality sleep, are reported.\n- **Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders:** The physical symptoms during panic attacks and persistent worries about health may align with somatic symptom disorder.\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n- **Suicidal Ideation:** Although not explicitly reported, the patient's feelings of hopelessness and being a burden could potentially escalate to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, warranting close monitoring.\n- **Substance Use:** Past attempts at self-medication with alcohol or marijuana could indicate a risk for substance use disorders.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\nThe patient exhibits a complex clinical presentation suggestive of co-occurring anxiety and depressive disorders. The predominant symptoms include recurrent panic attacks, agoraphobic avoidance, depressed mood, and significant distress. These symptoms result in substantial impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. The clinical picture necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to accurately identify the underlying conditions and guide treatment planning. The presence of avoidance behaviors, sleep disturbances, and somatic complaints further complicates the clinical presentation, highlighting the need for a multi-faceted treatment approach.",

You mentioned feeling like you're losing yourself in all of this and that it's hard for you to enjoy things you used to love because you're always worried about having an attack. <quote>\"I feel like I'm a burden to my friends and family because I always need reassurance that I'm okay.\"</quote> It's clear that these symptoms are affecting your relationships and overall well-being.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** The patient's symptoms align closely with <med>panic disorder with agoraphobia</med>. The recurrent panic attacks, fear of having an attack in public, and subsequent avoidance of places and situations strongly suggest this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's reports of <sym>depressed mood</sym>, <sym>hopelessness</sym>, and <sym>loss of interest in activities</sym> may indicate a co-occurring <med>depressive disorder</med>, but the predominant symptoms currently point towards panic disorder with agoraphobia.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any co-occurring mental health conditions.\n2. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address <sym>panic attacks</sym>, <sym>agoraphobia</sym>, and <sym>depressive symptoms</sym>.\n3. Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered to help manage <sym>anxiety</sym> and <sym>depression</sym>.\n4. Development of a coping skills toolkit to manage <sym>panic attacks</sym> and reduce avoidance behaviors.\n5. Family therapy to address the impact of the patient's symptoms on relationships and to provide support for loved ones.",
