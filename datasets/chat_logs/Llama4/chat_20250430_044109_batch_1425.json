Main Symptoms and Concerns:**\n\n* Depressive symptoms: reported feelings of disconnection, hopelessness, and depression (Q1, Q2)\n* Anxiety symptoms: endorsed anxious, worried, and fearful feelings (Q6, Q7, Q8)\n* Irritability and anger: reported increased irritability and snapping at people (Q3)\n* Sleep disturbances: described sleep problems, including difficulty sleeping through the night (Q14)\n* Substance use: reported heavy drinking and use of non-prescribed substances (Q21, Q23)\n\n**2. Patterns in Patient's Responses:**\n\n* The patient reports a general sense of disconnection and hopelessness, which may be indicative of depressive symptoms.\n* Anxiety and worry are prominent themes, with the patient endorsing avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations.\n* The patient reports increased irritability and anger, which may be related to their depressive and anxiety symptoms.\n\n**3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance:**\n\n* Depressive disorders: symptoms of depression, hopelessness, and disconnection (Q1, Q2, Q11)\n* Anxiety disorders: symptoms of anxiety, worry, and fear (Q6, Q7, Q8)\n* Substance use disorders: reported heavy drinking and use of non-prescribed substances (Q21, Q23)\n* Sleep-wake disorders: reported sleep disturbances (Q14)\n\n**4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs:**\n\n* Suicidal ideation: patient's response to Q11 (\"I don't know. It's not something I actively think about, but sometimes I feel like I wouldn't care if something happened to me.\") suggests possible passive suicidal ideation.\n* Substance use: patient's reported use of non-prescribed substances and heavy drinking may indicate a risk for substance use disorders.\n\n**5. Summary of Observations:**\n\nThe patient presents with a complex symptom profile, suggesting potential diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders. The patient's reports of disconnection, hopelessness, and irritability, along with their sleep disturbances and substance use, highlight the need for further evaluation and potential treatment. The presence of passive suicidal ideation and substance use risk factors necessitate careful consideration and potential intervention. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and development of a treatment plan are warranted to address these concerns.",

I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you through this.\n\n**Diagnosis:** <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med>, <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>\n\n**Reasoning:** Your responses suggest a complex symptom profile, with <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> (<quote>\"I've been a bit disconnected from things I used to enjoy\"</quote>), <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym> (<quote>\"Anxious, yeah. Always worried about something.\"</quote>), and <sym>irritability</sym> (<quote>\"Definitely. Little things set me off, and I find myself snapping at people more often than I'd like.\"</quote>).

Not stuff that's been prescribed to me, if that's what you're asking.\"</quote>) also raise concerns. These symptoms, along with your reported <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and <sym>substance use</sym>, suggest a potential diagnosis of <med>Major Depressive Disorder</med> and <med>Anxiety Disorder</med>.\n\n**Recommended Next Steps/Treatment Options:**\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to further discuss your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n2. Consider <med>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</med> to address <sym>depressive symptoms</sym> and <sym>anxiety symptoms</sym>.\n3.

Develop a <med>substance use treatment plan</med> to address your reported <sym>substance use</sym>.\n5. Encourage you to keep a <med>sleep diary</med> to track your <sym>sleep disturbances</sym> and identify potential triggers.",
