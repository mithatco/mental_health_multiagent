The questionnaire we'll be using today is called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. This assessment will help us understand your mental health across various domains. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. The assessment consists of 23 questions, and I'll be asking them one by one. Please feel free to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1.
