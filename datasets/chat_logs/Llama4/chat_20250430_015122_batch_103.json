Today, we'll be using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your mental health. This is a tool that helps us identify areas that might be affecting your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

          "query": "mental health diagnosis for patient with symptoms: ## Clinical Observation Summary\n\n### 1. Main Symptoms and Concerns\n\nThe patient reports significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic. Key concerns include:\n\n* Depressed mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (Q1, Q2)\n* Increased irritability and anger (Q3)\n* Excessive sleep as a means of escape (Q4)\n* Prominent anxiety and fear of panic attacks (Q6, Q7)\n* Avoidance behaviors due to anxiety (Q8)\n* Somatic complaints (e.g., stomach issues, headaches) potentially linked to anxiety (Q9)\n* Suicidal ideation without intent (Q11)\n* Poor sleep quality (Q14)\n* Intrusive thoughts (Q16)\n\n### 2. Patterns in Patient's Responses\n\n* **Anxiety and Depression:** The patient consistently reports symptoms of both anxiety (e.g., Q6, Q7, Q8) and depression (e.g., Q2, Q11).\n* **Avoidance Behavior:** The patient avoids situations that trigger anxiety (Q8).\n* **Somatic Complaints:** The patient experiences physical symptoms likely related to anxiety (Q9).\n* **Social Withdrawal:** The patient reports pulling away from social interactions (Q20).\n\n### 3. Potential Areas of Clinical Significance\n\n* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Symptoms of depressed mood (Q2), loss of interest (Q1), changes in sleep (Q4), and suicidal ideation (Q11) suggest potential MDD.\n* **Anxiety Disorders:** Recurring panic attacks (Q7), excessive fear and worry (Q6), and avoidance behaviors (Q8) indicate a possible anxiety disorder.\n* **Panic Disorder:** The patient's experience of panic attacks (Q7) and fear of having future attacks (Q6) are key symptoms.\n\n### 4. Risk Factors or Warning Signs\n\n* **Suicidal Ideation:** The patient reports thoughts of hurting themselves (Q11), albeit without intent. This requires careful assessment and monitoring.\n* **Substance Use:** The patient denies substance use (Q21-23), which is positive but should be monitored.\n\n### 5. Summary of Observations\n\nThe patient presents with significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic, meeting criteria for potential diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, specifically Panic Disorder. Suicidal ideation without intent is a critical risk factor that necessitates immediate attention and safety planning. Avoidance behaviors and somatic complaints further complicate the clinical picture. A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and formulation of a treatment plan addressing these symptoms is warranted.\n\n**DSM-5 Differential Diagnoses to Consider:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n- Panic Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\n- Social Anxiety Disorder\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Conduct a thorough diagnostic interview and consider additional assessments (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) to quantify symptoms.\n- Develop a treatment plan that may include psychotherapy (e.g., CBT) and pharmacotherapy.\n- Establish a safety plan given the patient's suicidal ideation.",

Your irritability levels are up, and little things can set you off, causing you to snap at people you care about. You're also experiencing <sym>panic attacks</sym>, which are intense and scary for you. It's like you're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. These feelings have led you to pull away from social interactions, and you're struggling with <sym>intrusive thoughts</sym> about having a panic attack or about your health.
