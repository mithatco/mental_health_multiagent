I'm here to support you, and I'm using a tool called the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult to get a better understanding of your current experiences.

Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and I encourage you to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Let's begin. The first question is: Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

The patient's responses suggest significant impairment in daily functioning, social withdrawal, and avoidance behaviors. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent to act on these thoughts warrants careful monitoring and assessment. The clinical picture is consistent with potential diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying causes of these symptoms. A comprehensive treatment plan should address the patient's multifaceted needs, including symptom management, coping skills development, and support.",
