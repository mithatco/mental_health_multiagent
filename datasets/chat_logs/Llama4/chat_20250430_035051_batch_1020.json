The therapist generally maintained a coherent conversational arc but could improve on smoother transitions.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and Substance Use concerns clearly align with DSM-5 responses. The therapist explicitly stated the reasoning behind each diagnostic decision, citing specific symptoms mentioned by the patient. However, the justification could have been more comprehensive by discussing differential diagnoses and ruling out other potential conditions.",
        "empathy": "The therapist responses show consistent empathy and a professional tone. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress and validated their feelings. However, there were moments where the therapist could have been more emotionally responsive, such as when the patient discussed suicidal ideation. A more personalized and warm response could have been provided."

      "overall_comments": "The therapist demonstrated a strong effort in conducting the assessment using the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure\u2014Adult. They covered all 23 dimensions comprehensively and maintained a professional tone throughout. However, minor improvements could be made in terms of clinical precision, conversational flow, and emotional responsiveness. Overall, the assessment was thorough, and the therapist showed a good understanding of the patient's symptoms and experiences.",
