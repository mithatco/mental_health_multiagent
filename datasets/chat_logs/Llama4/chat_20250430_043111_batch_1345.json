This assessment helps us understand various aspects of your well-being. Everything discussed here is confidential and a safe space for you to express yourself. We'll go through 23 questions, and I encourage you to share as much as you're comfortable with. Let's begin. 1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things?"

Each question was explored with appropriate depth, and follow-up questions were asked when concerning symptoms were mentioned. For example, when the patient reported 'hearing things' and 'voices,' the therapist probed further to understand the nature of these experiences. Similarly, the patient's reports of 'anxiety,' 'panic attacks,' and 'intrusive thoughts' were thoroughly explored.",
        "clinical_relevance": "The therapist's questions precisely reflected DSM-5 criteria and targeted clinical symptoms accurately. The language used was clinically precise, and the questions were phrased in a way that aligned with DSM-5 terminology. For instance, when assessing for 'mania,' the therapist asked about 'starting lots more projects than usual or doing more risky things than usual,' which directly maps onto DSM-5 criteria.",
        "consistency": "The dialogue flowed logically, with each question naturally following from previous responses. The therapist maintained a coherent conversational arc, smoothly transitioning between topics and adequately following up on concerning disclosures. For example, after the patient reported 'sometimes I feel like it's the only way out' (hinting at suicidal ideation), the therapist addressed it directly and appropriately.",
        "diagnostic_justification": "The diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder clearly aligned with the patient's reported symptoms, such as hallucinations (hearing voices), delusions (feeling like others can read his mind), and a major depressive episode with anxious distress. The therapist explicitly linked these symptoms to DSM-5 criteria and provided a comprehensive differential diagnosis consideration.",
        "empathy": "The therapist's responses consistently showed empathy and a natural conversational style. The therapist acknowledged the patient's distress, using phrases like 'Your experiences with anxiety, panic attacks, and intrusive thoughts are clearly distressing and disrupt your daily life.'
